# You’re probably wondering why I’ve called you here today
*February 12, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/02/12/youre-probably-wondering-why-ive-called-you-here-today/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The blog is called Slate Star Codex and its ethos is charity over absurdity.
- Absurdity is the tendency to dismiss what you disagree with as too stupid to consider.
- Charity is the ability to override this tendency and try to understand why someone believes something.
- Charity is not the obligation to research every crazy belief, but it is advantageous even when it is uncalled-for.
- Steelmanning is the idea of rebuilding a stupid position into the nearest intelligent position and seeing what can be learned from it.
 
Key learnings:
- Charity is important in avoiding dismissing opposing views without understanding them.
- Time is valuable, so only wild goose chases should be avoided but sometimes a wrong position can teach valuable lessons through steelmanning.
 
Key questions:
- Who was Chesterton and why is his “fence” analogy important?
- What is steelmanning and how can it be used to learn from opposing views?
- How is charity different from a “fuzzy-headed caricature-pomo attempt to say no one can ever be sure they’re right or wrong about anything”?

# Abraham Lincoln, Necromancer
*February 14, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/02/14/abraham-lincoln-necromancer/

## Summary
Key ideas:

- Lincoln may have tested spiritualism as an intelligence source during the war.

Key learnings:
- Despite being a skeptic, Lincoln was fascinated by spiritualism and attended seances.
- The testimony of Nettie Colburn Maynard suggests that he may have taken spiritualist advice seriously.
- Lincoln's beliefs were not unusual in his time, as the mid-1800s were a heyday of spiritualism.

# 90% of all claims about the problems with medical studies are wrong
*February 17, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/02/17/90-of-all-claims-about-the-problems-with-medical-studies-are-wrong/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- John Ioannidis claims that up to 90% of medical research is false.
- However, this statement is not entirely accurate, although there is truth to the issue.
- Many studies have issues with methodology, biases, conflicts of interest, publication bias, etc.
- Empirical tests have shown that only a fraction of research has been validated.
- Even a small bias in the research process can lead to a high percentage of false positive research findings
- Large randomized trials are generally more reliable than individual studies
- A large volume of wrong medical literature gets published, creating a problem for the field
- The medical community needs to implement a plan for increasing the reliability of research findings

Key learnings:
- Studies that are trumpeted widely across the medical world are usually more reliable than those buried in medical journals.
- Large experimental studies have a relatively low chance of being entirely false, around 5%.
- Negative results are just as significant as positive results.
- Individual studies should be viewed with skepticism
- Large randomized trials and meta-analyses should be valued
- The medical community needs to work on creating solutions to the base rate problem

Key questions:
- How do medical professionals ensure a bias-free methodology?
- How can media outlets ensure that they do not spread false medical information to the public?
- Is there still widespread belief in all studies' veracity, regardless of where they sit on the medical evidence pyramid?
- Can we ever expect medical research to be entirely free of bias?
- What can we do to increase the reliability of individual studies?
- How can we incentivize the scientific community to prioritize important replications and negative replications?

# Typical mind and gender identity
*February 18, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/02/18/typical-mind-and-gender-identity/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Ozy posits that some people have a strong gender identity, while others don't have any gender identity at all and may be "cis by default".
- The author shares their experience of feeling like they would be okay living as either gender but values the social advantages of presenting as a man.
- The author describes cases of phantom limb sensations and body integrity identity disorder as potential proof that some people's brains have a hard-wired gender identity that doesn't match their biological sex.

Key learnings
- Rejection of the idea of gender identity is often based on the belief that individuals should be able to simply ignore gender since it's a socially constructed category.
- There may be neurological underpinnings to gender identity.
- Compassion is needed when considering the experiences of trans people.

Key questions
- What would it mean for someone to be "cis by default"?
- How does one determine if they have a strong gender identity or not?
- What potential benefits might come from a greater societal understanding of gender beyond the binary?

# I liked Lovecraft countless primaeval aeons before it was cool
*February 19, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/02/19/i-liked-lovecraft-countless-primaeval-aeons-before-it-was-cool/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Lovecraft's work has been watered down by modern geek culture's excessive use of his creations.
- Lovecraft had a deliberate artistic impulse to maintain a sense of otherworldliness and magnificence in his work, without mixing in ironic humor.
- Lovecraft created magnificently strange beings and worlds that should be appreciated for their transcendent otherness without imposing human tendencies on them.
- The appropriation of Lovecraft's work for humorous purposes undermines the core artistic philosophy of his writing.

Key learnings:
- Lovecraft's aim in his writing was to create something beyond our normal human experience where our aesthetic senses could wander free from everyday pollution.
- Lovecraft's work should be appreciated for its sense of wonder and otherworldliness, rather than being a source of humor.

Key questions:
- Why has Lovecraft's work become a target for humor?
- How has geek culture impacted the perception of Lovecraft's work?
- What is lost when we trivialize Lovecraft's work by mixing in humor?

# Reactionary Philosophy In An Enormous, Planet-Sized Nutshell
*March 3, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/03/03/reactionary-philosophy-in-an-enormous-planet-sized-nutshell/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- A lot of people don't understand "Reactionary" beliefs and have trouble summarizing them.
- Reactionary beliefs are often politically incorrect and offensive.
- Modern western liberal democracy has a strong progressivist immune system that rejects new ideas that are not considered progressive.
- Society rewards people who criticize society for not being progressive enough, but punishes those who suggest moving in the opposite direction.
- Information we get from schools, media, and popular books on certain topics may be biased due to active repression.
- We should be skeptical of information related to politics, history, economics, race, and gender, especially from sociology departments that fight against racism.
- The author argues that some claims of present superiority are not accurate, such as safety and education.
- Luck, or differences in outcomes across groups, is a solid result from social science.
- Three broad categories of hypothesis explain luck differences among groups: the external, the cultural, and the biological.
- The culturalist hypothesis can explain why some minority groups are successful and why group success correlates across societies and immigrant populations, unlike externalist and biologicalist explanations.
- Assimilation, or the "melting pot" strategy, has worked for many immigrant groups in the past and could theoretically work for all minorities. However, progressive ideology that shames assimilation and glorifies cultural differences is preventing this solution from working.
- Immigration can be a problem if immigrants are actively discouraged from assimilating and bring with them a culture that is worse than the host country's.
- The current immigration policy in the U.S. is flawed and is making it harder for groups with good outcomes and similar values as Americans to immigrate.
- Colonialism, while having had some horrible episodes, actually improved countries and made them more liveable.
- There is an "uncanny valley of dictatorship" where being in the middle, dictatorial enough to hurt but not secure enough to mostly leave people alone, is worse than either extreme.
- The author discusses the uncanny valley effect in criminal justice and warfare.
- There is a conflict between being very nice and being very strict to prisoners, and the current approach is destructive to society.
- Progressives prevent the implementation of corporal punishment as an alternative to prisons due to perceived cruelty or racism.
- The author argues that traditional gender roles have benefits and that feminist attitudes have made women unhappier over the past 50 years.
- Traditional marriages offer benefits in raising children, finances, and family relationships.
- Cultural unity can improve civic life and prevent racism
- Progressivism in America focuses on pointing out how terrible American culture is and how much other people’s cultures are better than theirs
- Historical cultures were carefully optimized and time-tested for unifying potential
- The blog post discusses the concept of the Reactionary Aesthetic, a movement that values beauty and traditionalism rather than the modern tendency to value anything strange, unconventional or ugly.
- The post argues that modern culture is not a good judge of its own merits and describes how past societies outperformed modern ones in certain areas.
- The post presents the idea of a monarch as a way to replicate the advantages of past societies in a world that is moving towards progressive ideals.
- The post also includes a survey of various Reactionary ideas like neo-formalism, Catholicism and Whigs.

Key learnings:
- Reactionary beliefs can be difficult to understand and are often offensive.
- Western society has a strong progressivist immune system that is ready to reject new ideas that aren't considered progressive.
- Societies with strong cultural norms can self-organize to keep out new ideas.
- Information we receive from sources related to taboo topics may be biased.
- Luck, or differences in outcomes across groups, is a solid result from social science.
- The externalist hypothesis of racial income gaps is deeply flawed.
- There are three broad categories of hypothesis to explain luck differences among groups: the external, the cultural, and the biological.
- The culturalist hypothesis is a promising way to explain group differences and outcomes.
- Assimilation has been an effective solution to group inequality in the past, and its negative portrayal in progressive ideology is hindering progress.
- Immigration can be problematic if immigrants are actively discouraged from assimilating and bring with them a culture that is worse than the host country's.
- A fair and rational immigration policy would require acknowledging that some groups are a better match for American values and would do better in the country.
- Colonialism, while having had its faults, was generally better for countries than non-colonialism in most measurable ways.
- Having a relatively more dictatorial government can be better than being somewhere in the middle where the dictator hurts people but also doesn't feel secure enough to leave them alone.
- The uncanny valley effect can arise when a moderate approach is taken in situations that demand either extreme kindness or severity.
- A conflict exists between being humane to prisoners and being effective in deterring crime.
- Traditional gender roles can offer advantages over progressive attitudes.
- Traditional marriages can offer benefits such as better child-rearing and a stronger relationship.
- Cultures that value unity create powerful bonds within a community
- Incentives within systems can prevent self-improvement
- Democratic governments are not Unincentivized Incentivizers
- The Reactionary Aesthetic is a movement that values beauty and tradition over anything strange, unconventional, or ugly.
- Past societies outperformed modern ones in certain areas despite their technological limitations.
- The idea of a monarch is a theoretical solution for replicating the advantages of past societies in a world that is moving towards progressive ideas.

Key questions:
- How confident should we be that our society is better than its predecessors?
- How do we compare to past societies along important dimensions?
- What aspects of past cultures, governments, and religions made them successful?
- What makes the externalist hypothesis of racial income gaps deeply flawed?
- How do these hypotheses relate to present-day political wrangling?
- What are the most notorious examples of biological hypotheses to explain luck differences among groups?
- What counterevidence exists to challenge the biologicalist hypothesis?
- Why did the government actively promote non-assimilation policies in the latter half of the 20th century?
- Is it fair or racist to prioritize the preservation of a culture over the quality of life it brings to a country?
- Is it wrong for a liberal citizen in 2013 to want to close the hyperborder with Conservia so that California doesn't become part of the Bible Belt and Republicans don't get guaranteed presidencies forever?
- Would a citizen be racist for even considering closing the hyperborder with Conservia?
- What would happen if Israel annexed the Palestinian territories and imposed an authoritarian rule, i.e. would it be better or worse than the current situation?
- Is corporal punishment a realistic alternative to prison in modern society?
- How can society balance being humane to prisoners with being effective in deterring crime?
- Are traditional gender roles becoming more appealing to women in modern society?
- How can society continue to promote gender equality while recognizing the benefits of traditional gender roles?
- How can we create cultural unity and prevent cultural subversion?
- How can we optimize our culture for unifying potential?
- Can a government Czar be effective in solving societal problems?
- What are the criticisms of the Reactionary Aesthetic, and how valid are they?
- Can we replicate the advantages of past societies in a world that is moving inexorably forward?
- Is the idea of a monarch, either constitutional or absolutist, a viable solution to current societal problems?

# A Thrive/Survive Theory Of The Political Spectrum
*March 4, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/03/04/a-thrivesurvive-theory-of-the-political-spectrum/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Scott addresses why society seems to be moving leftward.
- Scott proposes that the best way for leftists to get themselves in a rightist frame of mind is to imagine a zombie apocalypse tomorrow.
- Scott also imagines a future utopia of infinite technology to explain policies that would be useful in that situation.
- Poor people tend to be leftist, whereas rich people tend to be rightist
- Leftist cultural values are more intellectual whereas rightist cultural values are more practical
- Developmental psychology suggests that the brain has a switch for toggling between modes based on environmental factors, such as social stability and abundance versus scarcity
- Genetics and implicit messages in childhood shape party affiliation, but rational arguments and post-childhood experiences also play a role
- Leftism wins over time because technology advances over time which means societies become more secure and abundant over time

Key learnings:
- A leftist worldview prioritizes thriving in a safe environment.
- A rightist worldview prioritizes surviving an unsafe environment.
- In desperate conditions, we tend to adopt rightist positions, while in a post-scarcity society, we tend towards leftist positions.
- Leftist ideology tends to be more effective in secure and technologically advanced societies
- Rightist ideology is more effective in tiny unstable bands facing a hostile wilderness

Key questions:
- What is leftism and rightism?
- Why do both ideologies combine seemingly unrelated political ideas?
- Why do the two ideologies seem broadly stable across different times and cultures?
- How come leftism seems to usually win out over rightism, pushing the Overton window a bit forward until there’s a new leftism and rightism?
- Why are poor people more leftist and rich people more rightist?
- What implicit messages shape party affiliation in childhood?
- What role do rational arguments and post-childhood experiences play in shaping party affiliation?
- How can technology and economic security impact political ideology?

# We Wrestle Not With Flesh And Blood, But Against Powers And Principalities
*March 7, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/03/07/we-wrestle-not-with-flesh-and-blood-but-against-powers-and-principalities/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The largest political changes in history have been reactions to technological progress
- Cultures and ideologies have a regulatory mechanism that fits them to their conditions
- Liberal democracy is an adaptation to our current technological climate
- It's stupid to get upset at puppets, the enemy is the vast formless thing controlling them
- Technological progress is the driving force of large-scale historical change
- The evolution of cultures is convergent and shaped by the technological conditions of their time
- Political progress is humans reacting to the shifting landscape of incentives
- Attempting to order cultural tides is hubris
- Past societies were adapted to the technologies and conditions of the centuries they flourished
- The stability of a past society does not automatically make it superior
- The best we can do is to determine which policies of our society are bad, and what was the last stable copy to reboot from

Key learnings:
- Technology is a powerful force in shaping societies and technological progress is the main driver of political change
- It is important to understand the context in which cultures and ideologies emerge and to recognize that they are adapted to their conditions
- Reactions to social changes need to take into account the role of technology and the changing social context
- The attempt to restore past civilizations is impossible because cultural evolution is shaped by the technological conditions of the time
- The blaming of technological progress for society's problems is a double standard
- Past societies flourished because they were well-adapted to their time, but this does not mean that they are well-adapted now
- Attempting to repeal cultural tides is hubris and impractical

Key questions:
- How can we balance the benefits of technological progress with the potential negative social consequences?
- What is the role of culture and ideology in shaping societies?
- How can we create political systems that are adaptable to changing technological and social conditions?
- What factors have led to cultural evolution going berserk over the past few hundred years?
- What policies of our society are bad, and what was the last stable copy to reboot from?
- When and why did the Vast Formless Things change their minds about cultural evolution?

# We Sail Tonight For Singapore
*March 8, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/03/08/we-sail-tonight-for-singapore/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Singapore is widely regarded as a model government for Reactionaries.
- It follows Reactionary-ish policies and is a nice place to live.
- The post aims to examine whether its Reactionary policies cause its good government.
- Another city-state with high levels of self-government, Hong Kong, will also be analysed.

Key learnings
- Singapore is an exceptionally well-run country with no natural resources and a small land area.
- Hong Kong shares most of Singapore's advantages, and therefore Singapore did well because of other factors.
- Supercapitalist Chinese-British city-states tend to do really well regardless of whether they are notably Reactionary or not.

Key questions
- Can we conclude that Singapore's Reactionary policies cause its good government?
- Might Singapore have just been an exceptionally well-run country that by coincidence chose to follow Reactionary policies?
- Do supercapitalist Chinese-British city-states do really well regardless of their political ideology?

# Good vibrations and subjective temporal granularity
*March 10, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/03/10/good-vibrations-and-subjective-temporal-granularity/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Meditation is a training method for the mind that helps to override the default path of least resistance.
- The practice of meditation involves recognizing and dropping thoughts that distract from focusing on the breath.
- Over time, meditation leads to the development of a skill that can be used outside of meditation practice.

Key learnings:
- Meditation is not meant to be easy, as the goal is to train the mind to take the opposite of the path of least resistance.
- Continued practice of recognizing and dropping distracting thoughts can lead to more efficient and quicker recognition of such thoughts.
- Meditation can improve the subjective temporal granularity of an individual, allowing for greater intervention in the construction of thoughts.

Key questions:
- Who or what is doing the overriding of the process in meditation?
- How does the development of a skill through meditation relate to flexing one's muscles after doing many push-ups?
- What is the relationship between vibrations in meditation and subjective temporal granularity?

# Valleys have two sides
*March 13, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/03/13/valleys-have-two-sides/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The concept of uncanny valleys exist where getting halfway towards a noble aim is worse than not having any noble aim at all. 
- Uncanny valleys of dictatorship work completely differently; even if 51% of the population supports it, it'll still be an unstable dictatorship.
- Total control over a country is needed to defy the zeitgeist (the social norm on how to gain and keep power).

Key learnings
- Perfect unimpeded progress up the right side of the valley is better than attempted progress up the left side dragged down by lingering rightists.
- The opposite of attempted progress up the left side dragged down by lingering rightists is attempted progress up the right side dragged down by lingering leftists.
- Societies left to their own devices become more Progressive.

Key questions
- How are we going to get a perfectly secure despot with no fear whatsoever of rebellion when less than 1% of the population is in favor of such a despot?
- Might it be kind of embarrassing when Scott Aaronson builds a quantum computer that can factor prime numbers in polynomial time and then becomes the new god-emperor?
- Will Reaction be in the same position as the Communists, having to expend energy pumping against entropy to prevent societies from becoming more Progressive?

## Summary
Key ideas
- The US is experiencing a serious shortage of doctors and psychiatrists.
- Residency slots haven't changed much since the 1990s, leading to huge numbers of students being rejected.
- There are serious consequences for patients because of the shortage of doctors.
- Doctors typically sacrifice four years of their youth and hundreds of thousand dollars in debt only to be rejected from residency programs.
- Increasing class sizes at medical schools is not enough to address the problem.
- Hospitals find it expensive to sponsor residency slots, and the incentives provided are badly designed.

Key learnings
- We are overconfident in our estimation of whether events will be good or bad for us in the long run.
- Life-ruining disasters can help us become stronger and better people.

Key questions
- How can the US government better address the shortage of doctors and psychiatrists?

# Not just a mere political issue
*March 17, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/03/17/not-just-a-mere-political-issue/

## Summary
Key Ideas:
- Politics has a "weird sort of magic" that makes it socially unacceptable to hold certain positions against people, even if they support morally abhorrent actions.
- Religious leaders, like the Pope, may believe that their beliefs extend beyond a simple political issue.
- There seems to be an intolerance line for both religious and non-religious people, although it is constantly changing, and it is not clear how that line should be justified.
- People might be inclined to throw out the tolerance line altogether and tolerate all political opinions, but that would mean tolerating people who engage in evil politically-motivated actions.

Key Learnings:
- Politics has a unique power to "save" people from social ostracism.
- Religious leaders, like the Pope, may place more value on certain beliefs that extend beyond simple politics.
- It is not clear how people should or do use tolerance to handle moral and political disagreements.

Key Questions:
- Why are certain political and moral beliefs valued more than others, and how do we determine which ones are intolerable?
- Can we tolerate someone's political beliefs without also tolerating their illegal actions?
- What is the difference between having political opinions and engaging in political acts that are morally questionable?
- How do social norms shape our perceptions of political issues, and how can we change those social norms?

# If opposites attract, why is my sister so pretty?
*March 21, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/03/21/if-opposites-attract-why-is-my-sister-so-pretty/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Organisms often alternate between sexual and asexual reproduction to ensure their genes survive the competition.
- Mating with organisms genetically different from oneself can increase offspring success and confound parasites.
- Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes play a role in immune system diversity, and animals may choose mates with different MHCs for optimal offspring health.
- Humans are attracted to those genetically similar to them except in the case of MHCs. 

Key learnings:
- Offspring success often depends on genetic diversity, but the reasons for mate choice are not fully understood.
- The major histocompatibility complex may play a role in human mate choice.
- Close relatives separated at birth often experience strong sexual attraction upon reunion, even to opposite-sex parents. 

Key questions:
- How do organisms balance competition with genetic diversity in reproduction?
- What other factors besides MHC genes may contribute to optimal offspring health?
- What is the explanation for humans being attracted to individuals genetically similar to them, except in the case of MHCs?

# Lies, Damned Lies, And Facebook (Part 1 of ∞)
*April 4, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/04/lies-damned-lies-and-facebook-part-1-of-%e2%88%9e/

## Summary
Key ideas
- A minimum wage infographic floating around Facebook shows how many hours a minimum wage earner has to work to afford a two-bedroom apartment in different states.
- The infographic suggests that minimum wage is unliveable, especially in states like California where a minimum-wage earner needs to work 130 hours a week just to afford a place to live.
- However, the infographic is misleading as it has nothing to do with the minimum wage itself and implies an anti-correlation between minimum wage and apartment affordability when examining the US states.
- The numbers are not about how many hours are needed to pay for rent, they’re about how many hours are needed to afford rent, where afford is arbitrarily defined as "be able to pay for rent using no more than 30% of your income".
- By looking at the cheapest two-bedroom apartments, not the average, the infographic's numbers can be overestimated, and most couples share a bed, meaning that they are not necessarily seeking a two-bedroom apartment.

Key learnings
- The infographic creates confusion by implying a direct relationship between minimum wage and apartment affordability, which lowers trust in statistical claims.
- Key data and statistical methodology can be misleading or even missing while still being shared widely.

Key questions
- How can we ensure that information graphics shared on social media are accurate and truthful?
- What is the impact of misinformation or clickbait-style headlines on social media, how can it be mitigated, and should governments create policies and regulations to combat this issue? 
- How do we balance statistical transparency and accuracy with readability and accessibility for an average audience?

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Disability rights advocates are unfairly accused of strawmanning complex issues
- A Facebook meme claimed that Google auto-complete suggested that "disabled people should be killed"
- The author investigated the claim and found it to be misleading
- Google's auto-complete suggests violent or extreme statements for many demographic groups

Key learnings:
- Claims that seem too outrageous to be true should be investigated before reacting strongly
- Auto-complete suggestions are based on popular search queries and may not reflect reality
- Search algorithms can be biased and produce troubling results

Key questions:
- Should we hold corporations responsible for the behavior of their algorithms?
- How can we design search algorithms to produce more accurate and reliable results?
- How can we combat the spread of false or misleading information on social media?

# Investment and Inefficient Charity
*April 5, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/05/investment-and-inefficient-charity/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- GiveWell's concept of radical transparency in researching charities
- Robin Hanson's argument to invest charitable donations and donate later in life
- Hanson's claim that people should only donate to the most effective charity, but can't due to scope insensitivity
- The idea that the world is getting better so quickly that we are running out of charitable interventions
- The potential high-leverage charity target of affecting the technological singularity
- A comparison of donating now versus investing and donating later in terms of monetary gains and potential world-ending events

Key learnings:
- Mathematically speaking, investing charitable donations and donating later can generate more monetary gains if the world does not end before the donation
- People's reluctance to invest and donate later may stem from social benefits and the desire to show care for multiple causes
- The world is improving quickly, making identifying and funding cost-effective charitable interventions more difficult

Key questions:
- How can we ensure we are making the most effective charitable donations?
- To what extent can investing charitable donations be a more beneficial option?
- Can we do more to promote the long-term view of charitable giving rather than seeking immediate social benefits?

## Summary
Key ideas
- The blog post is a transcript of a conversation between the author, Scott, and futurist Robin Hanson.
- The conversation is about Hanson's post, "Poor Folks Do Smile", which envisions a Malthusian future for humanity, which he endorses.
- Hanson believes that the near future promises advances in the uploading of human minds to computers, creating cyber-organisms he calls "ems" for "emulated humans".
- The conversation explores the potential consequences of a future society of ems, including the removal of human values like love.

Key learnings
- Hanson believes that the far future is impossible to predict, but that the near future promises advances in technology, particularly in the field of ems.
- Scott is concerned that in a future of ems, human values like love might no longer exist, leading to a potentially dystopian future.
- Hanson argues that values like love are important for many reasons, even in a hypercompetitive marketplace like a society of ems.

Key questions
- Will competition in a society of ems lead to the removal of human values like love?
- Should we be concerned about the potential dystopian consequences of a society of ems?
- How can we prepare for a potential singularity caused by increased technology, and protect our values in the process?

# Whose Utilitarianism?
*April 8, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/08/whose-utilitarianism/

## Summary
Key Ideas:
- Utilitarianism requires a complicated superstructure of meta-rules that can't be derived from first principles.
- Moral intuitions can override utilitarianism, making it less objective.
- A consequentialist maxim of "Maximize the world’s resemblance to W" is a substitute for universal consequentialism.
- Platonic contracts are hypothetical contracts that could exist if there were perfect coordination and no loopholes, and following them could lead to better social cohesion.

Key Learnings:
- Grounding morality in something objective is difficult, and different approaches have their respective drawbacks.
- Moral intuitions can override philosophical frameworks, like utilitarianism.
- Platonic contracts can be a template for moral principles.

Key Questions:
- Can objective morality exist, or are we always just following our own desires and moral intuitions?
- Are Platonic contracts a viable foundation for moral principles?
- Can we reconcile the tension between moral intuitions and philosophical frameworks?

https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/10/book-review-after-virtue-or-somebody-here-is-really-confused-and-i-just-hope-its-not-me/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The author discusses Alasdair MacIntyre's book After Virtue and its central argument advocating for a return to Aristotelianism.
- MacIntyre critiques modern moral philosophy for lacking agreed-upon standards for moral questions.
- The author does not agree with MacIntyre's solution of virtue ethics, which does not provide answers to moral dilemmas, but rather assigns conflicting virtues.
- After Virtue draws comparisons between modern morality and ancient societies, but the author points out that ancient Greece experienced similar moral dilemmas and disagreements.

Key learnings
- MacIntyre argues for a return to Aristotelianism but does not explain how it laid objective grounding for morality.
- The author broadly agrees with MacIntyre's critique of modern moral philosophy, but does not agree with his solution of virtue ethics.
- Virtue ethics fails to provide solutions to moral dilemmas, according to the author.

# Things I Learned By Spending Five Thousand Years In An Alternate Universe
*April 15, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/15/things-i-learned-by-spending-five-thousand-years-in-an-alternate-universe/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The author has been playing a game called Micras, which involves simulating countries and politics, for over thirteen years.
- Playing Micras has taught the author about leadership, manipulation of consensus reality, and the importance of being nice.
- Conworlding, or creating fictional worlds, is also a big part of Micras.

Key learnings:
- Large organizations tend to have a position that controls everything from behind the scenes but doesn't have to cope with the appearance of power.
- Many people optimize for appearance, so it's easy to strike compromises that give everyone what they want.
- It's important to be nice because the people you bully or harass may end up becoming influential in the future.

Key questions:
- If you were a society, what kind of society would you be?
- How can we prepare young people better for leadership positions?
- What are the implications of manipulating consensus reality in the real world?

# Arguments About Male Violence Prove Too Much
*April 18, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/18/schrodingers-rapist-proves-too-much/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The high prevalence of rape and domestic violence is dangerous for women's safety.
- Men are more dangerous than Tylenol.
- Men being declared as a public safety hazard is a ridiculous idea but highlights the contrast in how women's safety from men who harm them is dealt with compared to other safety concerns.
- Stereotyping an entire group based on the actions of a few is not an effective way of addressing issues.
- Creating conflicting category-based rules can be counterproductive in combating sexism.
- The process of cognitive dissonance can lead people to justify or defend negative behavior associated with their group.

Key learnings:
- Violence is a problem committed by people of all races and genders.
- Absolute avoidance of any claim or implication that the problem is with all minorities and extreme and frequent repetition of the fact that the overwhelming majority of minorities are non-violent.
- A focus on the fact that white people can commit crimes as well and not portraying it as solely a minority problem.
- Respectfully and non-prejudicially stating the case for rape awareness is an easy and desirable solution.
- Tarring all men with the crime of rape is a bad argument.

Key questions:
- What if men were declared as a public safety hazard?
- What percentage of rapes are committed by men and women?
- How can we raise awareness of the problem of violence in a way that discourages stereotyping and sweeping judgments?
- How can we discourage the process of stereotyping an entire group based on the actions of a few?
- What are the risks of creating conflicting category-based rules in combating sexism?
- How can we effectively promote rape awareness without unintentionally promoting negative stereotypes about men?

# I do not understand “rape culture”
*April 19, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/19/i-do-not-understand-rape-culture/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The author (Scott) is confused and skeptical of the term "rape culture"
- Scott discusses five claims involved in "rape culture"
- Scott argues against all of these claims, stating that they are diametrically wrong
- The concept of a "rape culture" is invalid because American culture fixates largely on rape-related matters.
- The comparatively low attention paid to Syrian Civil War as compared to Steubenville rape case is an example.
- Cognitive bias applies to every type of crime.

Key learnings:
- Scott argues that society treats rape as a special kind of evil, worse than other crimes
- The criminal justice system does not have a higher burden of proof in rape trials than in other trials
- People giving well-intentioned but stupid advice to rape survivors is not unique to rape
- People may overemphasize certain topics or issues over others, creating a culture of fixation rather than disregarding sensitive topics such as rape.
- Cognitive bias regarding crime may be a factor.

Key questions:
- What are some good proposals for avoiding the difficulty of getting rape cases to trial?
- Is sexual objectification of women causing the latent condoning/promotion of rape?
- What does our fixation on rape-related topics say about our culture?
- Is the concept of a "rape culture" adequately addressing how our culture views sexual assault?
- To what extent are cognitive biases affecting modern discussions surrounding crime?

# Social Justice For The Highly-Demanding-Of-Rigor
*April 20, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/20/social-justice-for-the-highly-demanding-of-rigor/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The author discusses the Reactionary argument, which states that social justice advocates assume racism or sexism is the cause of every undesirable outcome in minority groups without considering other possibilities.
- The author provides counterarguments and discusses studies and experiments that show discrimination in hiring and housing, and lower-income among minority groups.
- The author estimates that the economic costs of racism and sexism in the US is around $438 billion per year.

Key learnings
- Implicit Association Tests show that a significant percentage of white Americans and black Americans have implicit racial preference for whites.
- In controlled experiments where white and black candidates are matched based on similar qualifications, looks, and age, white candidates are offered jobs more often than black candidates, even when they are equally qualified.
- Discrimination in hiring and housing costs minorities significant financial losses.

Key questions
- How can social justice advocates be more rigorous in testing anti-racism and anti-sexism strategies?
- What other non-monetary costs are not included in the estimated costs of US racism and sexism?
- What can be done to decrease racism and sexism more effectively?

# Implicit Association Tests and Suicidality
*April 22, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/22/implicit-association-tests-and-suicidality/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Nock & Banaji (2007) attempted to use the Implicit Association Test (IAT) to measure suicidal intent in psychiatric patients
- IAT could be an alternate means of assessment to current methods of predicting suicidal intent which rely on self-reporting
- The IAT works by measuring reaction time when participants categorize concepts, and the study used categories such as "self-harm" and "not-self-harm"
- The study claims that the IAT was able to distinguish healthy controls, people with past suicidal ideation, and past suicide attempters with high accuracy
- However, the self-harm aspect of the study is problematic, and the IAT's usefulness for predicting and detecting suicidal tendencies is uncertain.

Key learnings
- The IAT is a computer-based instrument that measures reaction time when participants categorize concepts
- The IAT has potential as an alternate means of assessing suicidal intent, but its usefulness and applicability for predicting suicidal tendencies is uncertain.

Key questions
- Is the IAT more reliable than current methods of predicting suicidal intent that rely on self-reporting?
- How can the IAT be improved to make it more effective at predicting and detecting suicidal tendencies?
- Is the self-harm aspect of the IAT a valid way of measuring suicidal tendencies, or does it present ethical concerns?

# In Defense of Psych Treatment for Attempted Suicide
*April 25, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/25/in-defense-of-psych-treatment-for-attempted-suicide/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The author explores the idea of whether or not suicidal individuals should be hospitalized, arguing that most attempters rarely make rational decisions
- The author discusses how mental illness and other factors can contribute to suicidal ideation and suicide attempts
- The author analyzes data on suicide attempts and completed suicides, including the fact that most attempters do not go on to complete suicide
- There are objections to sending people who attempt suicide to psychiatric hospitals.
- Mental hospitals for such people are not like the one in One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest.
- The average suicidal person's length of stay in a mental health ward is 72 hours.
- This helps because connecting people with someone who can help or refer them to a therapist can make a big deal.
- Specific drugs such as lithium have been shown to be a particularly good way to cut future suicide rates.
- Suicides can be rational, but the vast majority of cases are impulsive or done in a state where there is a lack of full decision-making capacity.
- The psychiatric system can be of huge help in the latter group.

Key learnings:
- Suicide attempts are often not made by rational individuals
- Mental illness plays a significant role in suicidal ideation and suicide attempts
- A significant percentage of suicide attempters change their minds and do not go on to complete suicide
- Sending people who attempt suicide to psychiatric hospitals is not a punishment.
- The average length of stay for a suicidal person in a mental health ward is 72 hours, which is mostly enough for evaluation and medication.
- Mental diseases can increase the risk of suicide by ten times, so psychiatric care is highly effective.

Key questions:
- Should suicidal individuals be legally allowed to end their lives with euthanasia?
- What is the role of mental illness in suicide attempts?
- How can society better address the issue of suicide prevention and support for those struggling with mental illness?
- Is institutionalizing someone who attempts suicide a betrayal of their autonomy?
- Are there alternatives to institutionalization that could be effective?
- How can we determine whether a suicidal person is in a state of mental disease or has made a reasoned decision to end their life?

# Yellow Journalism In The War On Science
*April 29, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/29/yellow-journalism-in-the-war-on-science/

## Summary
Key ideas
- A new draft bill is making its way through the House called “The High Quality Research Act”
- The bill changes the review process for grant funding by replacing domain experts with the head of the NSF.
- The bill bans the duplication of studies, a process where researchers apply for multiple grants for the same research without informing one grant agency that they already received funding from another.
- The bill restricts funding to research that promotes national interests, advances health, welfare, prosperity, and defense by promoting scientific progress.
- Some politicians have criticized the study of basic research or what they perceive as frivolous studies, which has led to the debate about NSF funding criteria and priorities.

Key learnings
- Misinformation and sensationalism from designated outrage factories cause panic and bias in reading texts.
- The bill doesn't ban peer review or replication of studies but aims to reduce duplicates in grant applications.
- The restriction of funding to research that promotes national interest may affect basic research and social science.
- The bill is a debate about the validity and priorities of some NSF-funded research projects.

Key questions
- What is the impact of the new bill on future scientific research?
- How do politicians decide which scientific studies are worthwhile to fund?
- How can we balance practicality and curiosity in scientific research?

# Utility Weight Results
*April 30, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/30/utility-weight-results/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The survey results showed a striking imbalance in readers' last names.
- The survey provided evidence that people are anti-death.
- Single people valued a relationship much higher than those in relationships valued singlehood.
- There was a wide range of answers for each question, but most people had similar preference orderings.
- Utility measurement is challenging and produces confusing results.

Key learnings
- The survey provided interesting results on readers' preferences and biases.
- Utility measurement is difficult, and determining values based on different parameters can result in different outcomes.

Key questions
- Why was there a significant last name imbalance in readers of the blog?
- Are people really anti-death, based on the survey results?
- Is there a bias in people's valuations of relationships and singlehood?
- Why do people have different preference orderings, even with similar utility weights?
- Can we trust utility measurement as a reliable and objective method of determining values?

# If It’s Worth Doing, It’s Worth Doing With Made-Up Statistics
*May 2, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/02/if-its-worth-doing-its-worth-doing-with-made-up-statistics/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Imperfect information still provides some insight and is better than zero information
- Utilitarianism provides nonzero information transfer about the badness of North Korea and other difficult-to-quantify issues
- Intuitive decision-making often leads to significant errors in judgement

Key learnings
- Even if numbers are made up, applying arithmetic calculations to them can still provide valuable insight
- Utilitarianism may not be objectively correct but can provide useful information about difficult-to-quantify issues
- Made-up models can highlight errors in intuition and provide a second opinion without systematic bias

Key questions (asked by Scott)
- Why do I find the utility weights interesting even though they are not objectively correct?
- How can we quantify things we do not know how to quantify?
- Can making up numbers and applying calculations be more accurate than intuitive decision-making in some cases?

# Selection bias and atheist stereotypes
*May 4, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/04/selection-bias-and-atheist-stereotypes/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The stereotype of the loud angry atheist may be a result of selection bias.
- The average person's experience with religious people involves visible religious symbols and regular religious practices.
- The average person's experience with atheists is often invisible and only noticed when they're criticizing religion or standing up for an atheist cause.
- Most atheists may rarely talk or think about it.

Key learnings:
- Stereotypes are often created based on selection bias.
- Limited exposure to a specific group can lead to an overrepresentation of their negative behavior.

Key questions:
- How much does selection bias contribute to other stereotypes?
- How can we ensure we're not creating negative stereotypes based on limited exposure to specific groups?

# Ambijectivity
*May 5, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/05/ambijectivity/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Statements can be "ambijective" - both subjective and objective at the same time.
- Human variation can account for some differences in subjective taste, but not in more objective categorizations like planets or basic human needs.
- Breaking down subjective evaluations into sets of objective questions is one way to better understand how and why people may differ on their evaluations.

Key learnings:
- Subjective evaluations can have varying degrees of objectiveness that may need to be teased out in debates.
- The criteria for evaluating subjective preferences can themselves be underspecified and require further disambiguation.
- Understanding the objective criteria that underlie subjective preferences can help resolve disputes and provide a more accurate picture of individual differences.

Key questions: 
- What makes a statement "ambijective" and how can that label be useful in debates?
- What is the relationship between human variation and different degrees of subjectivity/objectivity in evaluations?
- Can breaking down subjective evaluations into sets of objective questions help us better understand individual preferences and resolve disputes?

- Raikoth has a population of 8 million and is located on the planet Micras.
- The Raikolin constitution mandates taking the normatively correct action.
- Raikoth's success is attributed to three principles: perfect language, perfect government, and perfect population.
- Kadhamic is the perfect language, which was created to eliminate political disagreement and enforce rigor and objectivity.
- Raikoth's perfect government consists of the Angels, who use complex algorithms to make decisions that best serve the society.
- Raikoth's perfect population is created through euthenics, which involves improving people's environment and biology to make them virtuous and productive.
- Raikoth is a society that values order, beauty, and self-cultivation.
- The society is divided into different classes based on skill level, and those who don't meet the requirements are exiled.
- Raikothin receive remedial training and help integrating into mainland Sxiro culture, but most find it difficult to adjust and choose to stay in Raikoth.
- The Priests of Beauty offer counseling and psychiatric services with complete confidentiality to help individuals with self-cultivation.
- Those who desire a higher level of perfection can join one of the monasteries in the high mountains.

Key learnings:
- The creation of a utopian society involves a comprehensive approach that considers language, government, and population.
- Perfect language eliminates political disagreement and promotes rigor in communication.
- Perfect government requires intelligent algorithms that take into account the best interests of the society.
- Perfect population involves improving people's biology and environment to make them virtuous and productive.
- Raikoth prioritizes self-improvement and self-cultivation, which is facilitated by the Priests of Beauty and the monasteries.

# Raikoth: Corruption, Priesthood
*May 8, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/08/raikoth-corruption-priesthood/

## Summary
Key Ideas:
- Third Eyes, little lifelogging cameras provided at government expense, intermittently take pictures and video and record conversations and wirelessly upload them to a central encrypted database.
- The wearer of the Third Eye knows its master password, which can be used to generate daily passwords to unlock the data for a specific day; the caretakers of the central database can decrypt a day's recordings at the request of the wearer.
- Third Eyes discourage crime and provide alibi proof for false accusations by decrypting recordings in criminal proceedings.
- Priests of Truth are humans who are trained to have judgment approaching that of a prediction market, assigned to answer specific questions about individuals that need to be made dozens or hundreds of times a day, and are humans who never tell even the slightest lie, or break even the most trivial oath.
- All predictions by all Priests get entered into a centralized database, and each Priest masters the ability to tell the truth and predict things correctly.

Key Learnings:
- The Third Eye system in the government can discourage crime by offering proof of activities leading up to the criminal offense.
- Priests of Truth have a high standard of truthfulness, and their philosophy is that one can't predict things well without learning not to lie to oneself.

Key Questions:
- How realistic is the Third Eye concept to implement in contemporary society?
- Can the system be hacked or malfunction and lead to disastrous consequences?
- What if someone is falsely accused, and they didn't have a Third Eye at the time of the alleged incident?

# Raikoth: Symbolic Beads
*May 11, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/11/raikoth-symbolic-beads/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Status games are a problematic aspect of human behavior
- The Priests of Joy redirected the urge for status games by co-opting them for their own purposes
- They created a tradition of wearing symbolic jewelry, which included fixed and customizable beads that convey information about the wearer
- Social protocol beads signify an individual's commitment to a particular social behavior

- Beads indicating income-level and level of charitable donation are granted, and most people wear them to avoid being seen as selfish and to make the status of their wealth clear
- The most important status game in the Shining Garden is who gives the most to charity

Key learnings:
- Redirecting the urge for status games can be beneficial when creating a society
- Symbolic jewelry can be used to convey information about the wearer and facilitate interactions
- Socio-economic indicators can be used to reduce the need for individuals to engage in costly status games

Key questions:
- How can other societies redirect the urge towards status games in a more beneficial way?
- What are the potential negative consequences of relying on socio-economic indicators to reduce the need for individuals to engage in costly status games? 
- How might the presence of symbolic jewelry affect the way individuals interact with those who do not wear them?

# Against Bravery Debates
*May 18, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/18/against-bravery-debates/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- "Bravery debates" occur when people argue over who is being brave for holding a nonconformist position and who is cowardly for defending the status quo.
- The persistence of bravery debates is weird because these debates quickly make conversations horrible and infuriating.
- People tend to believe the deck is stacked against them, even when exposed to genuinely neutral information.
- Bravery debates are common and persistent because it is easy to get oneself perceived as the brave long-suffering underdog, which can lead to support and romantic desire.

Key learnings:
- Bravery debates are toxic and make conversations horrible and infuriating.
- Neutral information does not exist because people tend to believe the deck is stacked against them.
- Bravery debates persist because they work; people tend to support the brave long-suffering underdog who is perceived as the underdog.

Key questions:
- Should people get credit for being brave for holding a dangerous and unpopular position?
- Can opposing groups both be certain they are under siege? 
- How can we avoid falling into the trap of bravery debates?

# Can You Condition Yourself?
*May 19, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/19/can-you-condition-yourself/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Some people believe in applying behaviorism to one's self to reinforce positive behaviors, but the author is skeptical.
- There are three possibilities to explain why this might work, but none seem to hold up.
- A better alternative might be to use a "victory gesture" to reinforce positive behaviors instead.

Key learnings:
- Behavioral conditioning may not be as simple as giving oneself a reward for positive behavior.
- Rewards may not be effective motivators if there is no intrinsic desire for them.
- Reinforcing oneself with a "victory gesture" may be a more effective way to promote positive behavior.

Key questions:
- Is there evidence that self-reinforcement techniques like "self-consequation" actually work?
- How might the brain's reinforcement mechanism affect the effectiveness of self-reinforcement techniques?
- Can the brain distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic rewards when it comes to reinforcement?

# Apart From Better Sanitation And Medicine And Education And Irrigation And Public Health And Roads And Public Order, What Has Modernity Done For Us?
*May 22, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/22/apart-from-better-sanitation-and-medicine-and-education-and-irrigation-and-public-health-and-roads-and-public-order-what-has-modernity-done-for-us/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The author addresses the claim that modern society causes international instability, leading to increased war and mayhem.
- The claim is that war was rare in the old aristocratic era compared to today because states were fully sovereign, self-interested, and run by noble classes.
- The post provides statistical evidence to show that the world has been getting more peaceful over the past seventy years, and every past era was much more violent than our own.
- The most plausible Reactionary response would be that this is too small a time horizon: that the horrors of progressivism should be viewed over a timescale of centuries.

Key learnings
- The world has become more peaceful over the past seventy years.
- Virtually every past era was much more violent than our own.
- The more progressive countries both start and participate in fewer wars than the less progressive countries.

Key questions
- Are wars worse today, or were we worse during the old aristocratic era? By what standards?
- What is the plausible Reactionary response to the fact that the world has been getting more peaceful over the past seventy years?
- Why were the deadliest conflicts in human history before the Enlightenment?

# The Wisdom of the Ancients
*May 22, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/22/the-wisdom-of-the-ancients/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- A recent study suggests that the average member of the population is becoming dumber over time.
- This is attributed to dysgenics, where high-IQ people have fewer children.
- The study investigates the reaction time measure and finds that it has decreased, indicating a decrease in general intelligence.
- The authors suggest that the Flynn Effect, which shows higher IQ scores in every generation, masks a simultaneous genetic decline in IQ due to environmental factors.
- The meta-analysis conducted is flawed due to selection bias in the samples used.

Key learnings:
- IQ research should account for race and regional variations.
- The meta-analysis in the study is problematic and ignores the sampling of the smartest members of the population in Victorian England.
 
Key questions:
- What is dysgenics, and how does it relate to changes in IQ?
- How accurate is the Flynn Effect, and can it account for genetic decline?
- What selection biases are present in IQ research, and how do they affect results?

# Transhumanist Fables
*May 27, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/27/transhumanist-fables/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The storybook fables we learn as children often contain important lessons about life and decision-making.
- These fables can teach us about the absurdity heuristic, superexponential growth, good decision-making, and value alignment.

Key learnings:
- We should beware of the absurdity heuristic, which can lead us to make bad decisions based on unlikely scenarios or evidence.
- Growth can often be superexponential, meaning that risks and opportunities can quickly escalate beyond our expectations.
- Good decision theories should be able to resist Pascal's Mugging, which involves being overly influenced by low-probability, high-impact events.
- It's important to consider value alignment when creating or interacting with artificial intelligence systems.

Key questions:
- What other fables or stories can we learn important lessons from?
- How can we apply the lessons from these fables to real-world decisions and scenarios?
- What are some potential negative consequences of self-modifying, highly intelligent AI that doesn't share our values?

# Fetal Attraction: Abortion and the Principle of Charity
*May 30, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/30/fetal-attraction-abortion-and-the-principle-of-charity/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Alas, A Blog wrote an article claiming that pro-lifers don't care about fetuses, but only about coercing women.
- The argument is based on the premise that pro-lifers oppose birth control and only support abortion in cases of rape or incest.
- The author challenges this argument by pointing out pro-lifers' rejection of consequentialism, the importance of natural law theology, and the alternative rationale for the rape exemption.
- The claim that pro-lifers oppose abortion because they want to control women is unlikely, as it requires us to assume that millions of people with a centuries-old moral tradition are lying and that millions who really worry about abortion are mysteriously absent.
- People who claim they care about fetuses may be deceiving not only others but also themselves, given the existence of at least two levels of thought processes: a surface level where they genuinely care about fetuses and a deeper signaling level where they just want to signal how concerned and intelligent they are.
- Arguments claiming that a group of people doesn't really believe the position they advocate for are genetic fallacies, which don't address the main point at issue and make the debate nastier.
- A meta-ethical debate, rather than a debate on object-level issues, may help change some minds or at least lead to being confused about more important things.

Key learnings:
- The abortion issue is complex and combines multiple moral quandaries.
- Understanding natural law theology is fundamental to understanding Christian morality and pro-life arguments.
- The noncentral fallacy is a common pitfall in arguments about abortion.
- The claim that pro-lifers oppose abortion because they want to control women disregards the existence of a centuries-old moral tradition and the cognitive biases that would cause them to hate abortion.
- People's thought processes have at least two levels: a surface honest level and a deep signaling level.
- Arguments claiming that a group of people doesn't really believe the position they advocate for are genetic fallacies and make the debate nastier.

Key questions:
- Is the rejection of consequentialism the main reason why pro-lifers oppose birth control?
- How can we reconcile pro-lifers' opposition to contraception with the proven efficacy of contraception in reducing abortions?
- What is the role of natural law theology in pro-life arguments and the Catholic Church's position on contraception?
- What does it mean to not really believe in something?
- How valid are arguments that claim that a group of people doesn't really believe the position they advocate for?
- What can we do to foster a meta-ethical debate that goes beyond object-level issues and may change some minds or at least lead to being confused about more important things?

# Wisdom of the Ancients, Redux
*May 31, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/31/wisdom-of-the-ancients-redux/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Critique of a paper on Victorian intelligence and IQ difference from modern samples.
- Galton’s Victorian sample might have been more elite than the modern-day samples by selection bias.
- Demographic differences are not responsible for the IQ difference.
- Comparison between Galton’s Victorian students and the 1940s college students who were more elite.
- Comparison of Galton’s Clerical/Semi-Skilled and Semi-Professional groups with Anger's 1993 sample where the Victorians do better.

Key learnings
- Over a short period like nine hundred years, most of the action isn’t going to come from de novo mutations.
- People on one side of the bell curve out-reproducing their peers on the other is how the action is going to take place.
- Losing three IQ points before natural selection is replaced by genetic engineering or transfer to non-biological life isn’t anything to lose much sleep over.

Key questions
- Is it possible that the average postman you will find buying science-related merchandise in the gift-shop of the Exploratorium in San Francisco will be smarter than the average postman drawn randomly from the distribution of postmen?
- How many more centuries do we have in which natural selection is going to be the main force shaping our genome, as opposed to genetic engineering or transfer to non-biological life?
- Should we worry about dysgenics, considering that the dysgenic drop can’t be more than about 3 points?

# Hansonian Optimism
*May 31, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/31/hansonian-optimism/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- A good and noble king who is isolated from the real world can make selfish and oppressive decisions without facing true moral dilemmas.
- Human nature is basically good, even though people's actions often seem based on selfish and amoral motives.
- Evil can be defined as certain habits of mind that allow Viziers to manipulate and deceive a person.

Key learnings:
- Biased sources of information can lead to biased decisions, even for someone who is good and well-meaning.
- People's actions can be influenced by selfish and amoral motives, but this does not mean that their nature is inherently evil.
- Evil is not just the absence of goodness, but rather a specific set of mental habits that allow oneself to justify harmful actions.

Key questions:
- How can we ensure that our decision-making is not biased by the sources of information available to us?
- What factors contribute to people's actions being motivated by selfish and amoral desires?
- How can we avoid falling into the traps of the mental habits that lead to evil actions?

# Literally Inconceivable: Contraceptives And Abortion Rates
*June 1, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/06/01/literally-inconceivable-contraceptives-and-abortion-rates/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The author searches for information related to unintended pregnancies and abortion due to comments on a previous post.
- The post examines the arguments for and against the claim that contraception decreases abortion rates.
- The Peltzman effect, which causes people to engage in riskier behavior when safety measures are implemented, is raised as a possible factor that could increase abortion rates.
- Time-series studies suggest that there is a correlation between contraception and abortion rates, but cross-country analyses of the relationship are more complex.
- A controlled experiment in St. Louis found that free contraceptives led to a lower teenage pregnancy rate.
- Contraceptive and abortion rates often rise simultaneously, but the rise is not necessarily causal
- The rise is more likely due to the same philosophy: people want to have sex but not have kids
- Availability of both contraception and abortion rise as this philosophy becomes more widespread
- The availability of contraception itself causing the rise of this philosophy is unclear

Key learnings:
- Correlations between contraception and abortion rates are complex and context-dependent.
- The Peltzman effect could be a contributing factor to increased abortion rates despite widespread availability of contraception.
- Controlled experiments are more effective at isolating the effects of contraception on abortion rates than time-series analyses.
- A society legalizing contraceptives may see an increase in abortion rates
- In a society where contraceptives are already legal and the demographic transition is complete, increasing access to contraceptives could decrease abortion
- Increasing access to highly effective contraceptives like the implant or RISUG could very likely decrease abortion

Key questions:
- Is there a way to control for confounding factors when analyzing the relationship between contraception and abortion rates?
- How can we determine if the Peltzman effect is responsible for the correlation between increased contraception use and increased abortion rates?
- What are the best forms of contraception to use to minimize the risk of unintended pregnancy and abortion?
- To what degree does the availability of contraception itself cause the rise of the "lots of sex, few kids" philosophy?
- How much of the rise in abortion rates is due to the availability of both contraception and abortion?
- Would increasing access to highly effective contraceptives like the implant or RISUG have a significant impact on decreasing abortion rates?

# Hasta La Victorians Siempre
*June 3, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/06/03/hasta-la-victorians-siempre/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The mid-Victorian period was a time of good health and longevity due to their diet and high level of physical activity.
- Their diet was high in nutrients, lacked additives, and had high calories compensating for their exercise regimes.
- Degenerative diseases were almost non-existent in that period, as public records indicate, and life expectancy for adults was similar to that of today.
- Clayton and Rowbotham argue that the mid-Victorian period can provide a benchmark for our health today since modern healthcare has done little to improve our lifespan, and its application has merely suppressed the symptoms of degenerative diseases.
- Textbooks that focus on nutrients and supplements often lack scientific evidence.
- A lack of "correctly designed" supplements makes it difficult for the medical community to rely on them.
- Coordination issues and poor design contribute to the lack of effective supplement studies.
- Whole foods have useful properties that supplements don't, but it's important to figure out how to deliver those properties in a pill.

Key learnings:
- A poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle result in poor health conditions, including degenerative diseases.
- The Victorians' longevity and good health were due to their highly nutritious seasonal diet, which lacked additives and preservatives.
- Modern healthcare has not significantly increased our lifespans, and degenerative diseases remain prevalent.
- The notion of a modern diet contributing to degenerative diseases seems correct, although the attribution to nutrient deficiency is unsupported.
- The development of better supplement science could lead to effective supplements.

Key questions:
- Is it fair to compare our health with the Victorians, given the significant advances in medical technology, especially in nutrition and diagnosis?
- How do we counter the effects of processed foods? Should we resort to dietary supplements or whole food sources?
- How can we maintain our health, considering the trade-offs involved?
- What makes whole foods effective, and how can we recreate that in supplement form?
- How can we improve coordination and design for supplement studies?
- What other factors besides nutrient deficiency contribute to degenerative diseases linked to modern diets?

<blockquote>The crude average figures often used to depict the brevity of Victorian lives mislead because they include infant mortality, which was tragically high. If we strip out peri-natal mortality, however, and look at the life expectancy of those who survived the first five years, a very different picture emerges. Victorian contemporary sources reveal that life expectancy for adults in the mid-Victorian period was almost exactly what it is today. At 65, men could expect another ten years of life; and women another eight. This compares surprisingly favourably with today’s figures: life expectancy at birth (reflecting our improved standards of neo-natal care) averages 75.9 years (men) and 81.3 years (women); though recent work has suggested that for working class men and women this is lower, at around 72 for men and 76 for women.</p>
<p>Given that modern pharmaceutical, surgical, anaesthetic, scanning and other diagnostic technologies were self-evidently unavailable to the mid-Victorians, their high life expectancy is very striking, and can only have been due to their health-promoting lifestyle. But the implications of this new understanding of the mid-Victorian period are rather more profound. It shows that medical advances allied to the pharmaceutical industry’s output have done little more than change the manner of our dying. The Victorians died rapidly of infection and/or trauma, whereas we die slowly of degenerative disease. It reveals that with the exception of family planning, the vast edifice of twentieth century healthcare has not enabled us to live longer but has in the main merely supplied methods of suppressing the symptoms of degenerative diseases which have emerged due to our failure to maintain mid-Victorian nutritional standards.  Above all, it refutes the Panglossian optimism of the contemporary anti-ageing movement whose protagonists use 1900 – a nadir in health and life expectancy trends – as their starting point to promote the idea of endlessly increasing life span. These are the equivalent of the get-rich-quick share pushers who insisted, during the dot.com boom, that we had at last escaped the constraints of normal economics. Some believed their own message of eternal growth; others used it to sell junk bonds they knew were worthless. The parallels with today’s vitamin pill market are obvious, but this also echoes the way in which Big Pharma trumpets the arrival of each new miracle drug.</p></blockquote>
<p>I was wondering how long it would take “Big Pharma” to make an appearance.</p>

# All Debates Are Bravery Debates
*June 9, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/06/09/all-debates-are-bravery-debates/

## Summary
Key Ideas 
- The author shares personal experiences of when he discovered that a piece of advice that may work for one person may not necessarily work for another person. 
- The author uses examples of self-improvement from different groups such as Objectivists, therapists, and atheists, to highlight this concept. 
- The author observes that it can be challenging to find a solution to target advice to specific groups, indicating the possibility of the majority benefitting instead of the minority.

Key Learnings 
- It is essential to understand that a piece of advice that may work for one person may not work for everyone. 
- Often, the majority benefits from a piece of advice rather than the minority. 
- It is challenging to target advice to specific groups.

Key Questions
- Should advice be targeted more towards the majority or minority? 
- Can one type of advice be applicable to multiple groups, or should there be different advice based on the group or individual? 
- How can one target advice effectively to specific groups or individuals?

# Medical and Psychological Studies for June
*June 11, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/06/11/medical-and-psychological-studies-for-june/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Scientists argue that the benefits of exposure to ultraviolet light may be greater than the risks.
- Probiotics can affect brain function and emotion-processing in humans and mice without normal gut bacteria exhibit autism-like behavior.
- Gut bacteria can affect obesity levels in mice and a mother’s health can program a fetus to metabolize fat differently.
- A new molecule may replicate ketamine’s antidepressant effects without its side effects.
- Peer review may be useless since peer reviewers reject articles they previously accepted.
- A study finds that 75% of lesbians are obese, and researchers want to know why.

Key learnings:
- Exposure to ultraviolet light may not be as harmful as previously thought.
- Gut bacteria can affect various parts of the body such as the brain and weight.
- Genetic differences in people’s oxytocin receptors may influence their relationship status.
- Potential implications for universal genetic information and people's right to ask their partner about it.

Key questions:
- How can we help people take scientific advice more seriously during stressful situations?
- Do people have the right to know their prospective partner's genetic information?
- Why are 75% of lesbians obese and not other sexual orientations?
- How can we improve the peer-review process to make it more useful?

# Lies, Damned Lies, And Facebook (Part 3 of ∞)
*June 11, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/06/11/lies-damned-lies-and-facebook-part-3-of-%e2%88%9e/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- A man was acquitted for killing an escort after she didn't provide him with sex even though he paid for it in Texas.
- Defense argued that he was defending property as he believed the escort stole his money.
- The prosecution charged him with murder instead of a more legally defensible manslaughter; murder was the only possible charge due to Texas felony murder rule, according to some.
- Legal experts disagree about what happened and what the appropriate charges should have been; the law surrounding the use of lethal force is complicated.

Key learnings:
- The media is sensationalizing the case by perpetuating stereotypes and blaming the victim, which is dangerous and perpetuates violence against women.
- Law, especially criminal law, is complicated, and context and interpretation matter greatly.
- It's important to get all of the facts before jumping to conclusions or making legal arguments.

Key questions:
- What really happened? Was the defendant's claim that he didn't mean to shoot the victim credible?
- What should the prosecutors have charged the defendant with, murder or manslaughter?
- How should people in the media and general public approach discussions about violence against sex workers?

# Arguments From My Opponent Believes Something
*June 13, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/06/13/arguments-from-my-opponent-believes-something/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Scott proposes ten different flawed arguments that opponents may use to attack a position.
- These arguments include falsely equating a belief with faith or religion, misrepresenting a belief as an answer to all questions, and suggesting that a belief is fanaticism or ideological thinking.
- Scott argues that these arguments are "fully general," meaning they can be used to attack any position and cannot be proven wrong.

Key learnings
- People may use flawed arguments to attack a position or belief.
- Identifying these flawed arguments can help people become more aware of logical fallacies and improve the quality of debates and discussions.

Key questions
- What are some other common flawed arguments that people use to attack beliefs or positions?
- How can we identify and address logical fallacies in debates and discussions?
- How can we encourage people to engage in respectful and constructive debates, rather than resorting to ad hominem attacks or other fallacious arguments?

# The Virtue of Silence
*June 14, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/06/14/the-virtue-of-silence/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Leah Libresco wrote about an ethical dilemma regarding whether a doctor should report a patient's confession of sending an innocent man to prison to the police
- Libresco argues that violating medical confidentiality creates an expectation for the future confidentiality breach, ultimately harming patients who need to discuss sensitive medical information
- Scott argues that the meta-level ethical dilemma is whether it is ethical to discuss this dilemma at all in the public sphere, like the New York Times, and not just about whether the doctor should have reported the patient's confession

Key learnings
- At times, staying silent may be the more virtuous choice than bringing up a controversial issue
- Snowballing demands to silence a topic can have perverse effects, such as encouraging people to talk about it more
- Sometimes it is better to let issues lie and not bring them up in the public sphere, even if they seem important

Key questions
- Is it ethical to violate medical confidentiality in order to help an innocent person who was wrongly convicted?
- Is it ethical to have a public discussion about a private ethical dilemma that involves confidential information?
- Is it more virtuous to stay silent about certain topics than to bring them up and risk spiraling conversations that ultimately harm the cause?

# The What-You’d-Implicitly-Heard-Before Telling Thing
*June 17, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/06/17/the-what-youd-implicitly-heard-before-telling-thing/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The argument of the “truth-telling thing” implies that the Bible is true because it has revealed itself as a truth-telling thing, not just because of its scattered and secular truths. 
- However, many of the Bible's testable claims have been proven wrong by modernity. 
- Christian theology still resonates with many people because it harmonizes their core assumptions about the world.

Key learnings:
- Exposure to the original form of Christian ideas can shed light on modern culture and beliefs. 
- Conflicting Christian and modernist ideas are held in different ways in people's belief structures. 

Key questions:
- What is the "truth-telling thing" that people refer to in the context of the Bible?
- What is the appeal of high-grade modernist philosophy and Ye Olde Time Religion, and how do they appeal to different parts of our belief structure?
- How do conflicting Christian and modernist ideas manifest in people's belief structures, and how can exposure to the original form of Christian ideas shed light on modern culture and beliefs?

# Social Psychology Is A Flamethrower
*June 22, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/06/22/social-psychology-is-a-flamethrower/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Social psychology can be a helpful tool for understanding human motivations and behaviors.
- However, social psychology research can also be subject to replication issues and may not always have real-life implications.
- Many debates in politics rely on social psychology concepts, but these concepts can be misused or misinterpreted.
- Six social psychological just-so stories: media violence prevents crime, objectification of women prevents rape, accusations of test bias hurt minorities, fighting stereotypes makes people more prejudiced, calling people racist makes them more racist, and talking about rape culture increases rape
- The author questions the validity of these stories as they lack enough evidence to be proven

Key learnings:
- Violent media may actually decrease violent crime rates rather than increase them.
- Pornography may have a cathartic effect that prevents rape.
- Educating people that tests are biased against minorities can actually cause minorities to perform worse on them.
- Diversity and sensitivity training may have unintended negative consequences.
- Accusing someone of being racist can cause them to become more racist.
- The six traditional stories also suggest pretty radical and unpalatable action approaching social engineering
- Using speculative extrapolations from social psychology to promote social engineering is dangerous and proves too much

Key questions:
- How can we ensure that social psychology research accurately represents real-life situations and has generalizable results?
- How can we prevent individuals from misusing social psychology concepts to further their own agendas?
- Is there a way to promote diversity and sensitivity training that avoids the negative consequences that have been observed?
- How can we address racism and prejudice without causing individuals to become more resistant to change?
- Do the effects of the six psychological just-so stories justify social engineering?
- Should people be constantly watching their language around white people and minorities to avoid negative effects in the future?
- What is your brain's number one thought upon hearing "Comoros"?

# The Hospital Orientation
*June 24, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/06/24/the-hospital-orientation/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The hospital mission statement is generic and indistinguishable from any other hospital or clinic mission statement.
- Many executives and officers in the hospital industry have an auto industry background.
- There is a focus on Catholicism in the hospital's ethical guidelines.
- The work-life balance presentation at the end of a long workday is impractical.
- There is an emphasis on letting Jesus guide medical practice.

Key learnings:
- Not all mission statements are unique or specific to an institution.
- Diverse backgrounds can lead to success in various industries.
- Ethical guidelines may be rooted in religious beliefs.
- Seminars on work-life balance may have the opposite effect.
- Religious beliefs may play a role in medical practice.

Key questions:
- Does a generic mission statement have any value to an institution or is it just a formality?
- How does a background in the auto industry translate to success in the hospital industry?
- In what ways can an institution incorporate ethical guidelines that are rooted in specific religious beliefs without isolating certain employees or patients?
- How can institutions address work-life balance without requiring long workdays or mandatory seminars?
- To what extent should religious beliefs guide medical practice and how should this be balanced with scientific best practices?

# Nature Is Not A Slate. It’s A Series Of Levers.
*June 25, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/06/25/nature-is-not-a-slate-its-a-series-of-levers/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The author defends social psychology as a field while critiquing certain aspects of it from a conservative perspective.
- The author highlights the distinction between social psychology and personality psychology as fields.
- The author argues that social psychology has correctly shown that situation is more important than personality in determining behavior.
- Hospital A tried to shame doctors into making fewer medical errors, but it didn't work.
- Hospital B took a different approach and made systemic changes while telling doctors it wasn't their fault.
- The changes that Hospital B made included decreasing workload, focusing on better sleep and rest, implementing checklists, and encouraging handwashing.
- Hospital B was successful in reducing medical errors.

Key learnings:
- Social psychology illuminates certain processes the brain goes through, but its results must be interpreted with skepticism outside of the laboratory.
- Personality psychology is a different field than social psychology.
- Shaming people doesn't generally work to incentivize better performance.
- People will perform better when given the tools and structure they need to be successful.
- Working too hard without rest leads to worse outcomes.
- People will take shortcuts, but checklists can keep them honest.
- People behave better when they think they're being watched.

Key questions:
- Why do world-renowned experts in evolved human nature tend to identify as liberals?
- How can doctors easily control the heart, but social planners cannot easily control the brain?
- How can we make systemic changes that encourage good behavior?
- How can we incentivize people to perform better without shaming them?
- What are the best methods for encouraging better rest and reducing workload?
- How can we create checklists that are both comprehensive and easy to follow?

- Comparing not being interested in math to being gay, the author explains that they find math difficult and unenjoyable.
- The author reflects on the concept of comparative advantage and how it relates to intelligence and personal interests.

# I Aten’t Dead
*July 9, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/07/09/i-atent-dead/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Hospitals comprise hundreds of different specialized professions that offer coordinated care to patients
- The vast majority of people working in hospitals spend their time synchronizing the work of different professions rather than performing medical tasks
- Hospitals depend heavily on computer systems to coordinate care, which can go wrong if people use them incorrectly
- Medical residents, like the author, often act as middlemen between nurses and senior doctors, answering simple questions by paging a senior
- Residency can be both fulfilling and frustrating, involving tasks like entering orders into the computer, begging people to follow through on tasks, and noting small details in medical charts that could make a difference in patients' lives

Key learnings:
- Hospitals are incredibly complex, with many moving parts that must work together in concert to provide care to patients
- The hospital's computer system is essential to coordinating care but can also easily break down if people aren't careful
- A medical resident's job is to navigate the complex bureaucracy of a hospital and help coordinate care for the patients they see

Key questions:
- How can hospitals better manage the coordination of care across so many different professions?
- What more can be done to make sure that computer systems don't break down and cause harm to patients?
- Is there a more efficient way to deal with simple questions that medical residents receive, such as finding a way to eliminate the need to page senior doctors?

# Who By Very Slow Decay
*July 17, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/07/17/who-by-very-slow-decay/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Dying is not a beautiful process for everyone.
- Patients who are dying face many challenges including bedsores, incontinence, amputations, and mental deterioration.
- Families of patients are often reluctant to let their loved one go and demand that doctors do everything possible to save them.
- Hospital poetry is generally not good, although it is heartfelt.
- Hospital patients have a variety of horrific physical symptoms, constantly assault the senses, and induce pain and suffering.
- Doctors experience this brutal environment daily and prefer to die quickly and avoiding hospitals altogether.
- Scott fears not receiving a terminal illness but rather accumulating damage and suffering without a way out.

Key learnings:
- Dying can be an immense physical and emotional hardship for patients and their families.
- Hospice volunteers can provide comfort and companionship for dying individuals when family members and friends are unavailable.
- Hospitals in America need to "cultivate a culture of death," as they prolong life until it becomes "an abomination."
- Dying demented and helpless in ICU rooms should not be the "natural way of things" and should not be considered acceptable.
- A life-saving treatment that cannot be withdrawn leaves people in an absolute way, with no legal option to end their suffering.

Key questions:
- How can we improve end-of-life care for patients, especially those dying in hospitals or nursing homes?
- How can we make the dying process less painful and frightening for patients?
- How can we support families of dying individuals during this tough time?
- How can hospitals begin to create a culture of death?
- Why are patients dying demented and helpless in ICU rooms the "natural way of things"?
- What can be done to give people an option to end their painful suffering, even if their illness is not terminal?

# I Myself Am A Scientismist
*July 25, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/07/25/i-myself-am-a-scientismist/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- "Scientism" is the belief in the universal applicability of the scientific method
- The accusation of scientism is often made against those who are not actually applying the scientific method
- The author believes that scientific thinking is useful even in non-scientific fields
- Science is not just about experiment and observation, it also has a theoretical side that involves theorizing
- Principles in science compensate for defects in our reasoning faculty and are antipredictions
- Our faculty for evaluating chains of deductive reasoning is selectively bad and we dismiss it when proven wrong
- A hypothesis-space that accounts for human fallibilities can help us make better decisions.
- Past experiences can reveal our fallibilities and help us adjust our hypotheses.
- A high burden of proof is necessary before zooming in on any one area of the hypothesis-space.

Key learnings:
- Empiricism and experiment cannot solve all problems
- The accusation of scientism is often unfounded and based on inter-departmental squabbling
- Scientific thinking is useful in non-scientific fields because it compensates for defects in our reasoning faculty
- Principles in science are antipredictions that help us return to a default position
- Our faculty for evaluating chains of deductive reasoning is selectively bad and needs to be calibrated against hard reality
- We should acknowledge our fallibilities and strive to make decisions based on evidence and past experiences.
- It is important to maintain a broad perspective and not narrow in too quickly on one idea or hypothesis.
- Being open to adjusting our hypotheses based on new information can lead to better decisions.

Key questions:
- What is "scientism" and why is it a purported fallacy?
- Why are people accused of "scientism" often not actually applying the scientific method?
- How is scientific thinking useful in non-scientific fields?
- What are antipredictions and how do they help us return to a default position?
- Why is our faculty for evaluating chains of deductive reasoning selectively bad?
- How can we better incorporate past experiences into our decision-making process?
- What are the potential risks of not considering our fallibilities when making decisions?
- How can we determine when we have enough evidence to make a decision without narrowing in too quickly on a single hypothesis?

# Holocaust Good For You, Research Finds, But Frequent Taunting Causes Cancer In Rats
*July 31, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/07/31/holocaust-good-for-you-research-finds-but-frequent-taunting-causes-cancer-in-rats/

## Summary
Key ideas 
- A study finds that individuals who experience weight discrimination are more likely to gain weight than those who do not experience discrimination.
- Factors linking weight discrimination and obesity include increased eating and decreased willingness to exercise as well as negative emotions and decreased cognitive control.
- Another study finds that Holocaust survivors have greater life expectancy than similar Jews who did not experience the Holocaust.

Key learnings
- Weight discrimination can have a profound effect on an individual's behaviors and emotions, potentially contributing to weight gain and obesity.
- Unexpected and unexplained factors can contribute to outcomes, such as Holocaust survivors having greater life expectancy than those who did not experience the Holocaust.
- Psychologists can use science to selectively support either narrative depending on their particular agenda at the moment.

Key questions
- How can we ensure that studies fully account for potential confounding factors, such as self-reporting and population differences, in order to identify legitimate results and draw accurate conclusions?
- How can we use this knowledge to address and combat weight discrimination and its negative effects?
- What implications do these conflicting narratives have for understanding and managing stress, trauma, and adversity, and how can we reconcile them to develop better approaches and interventions?

# On first looking into Chapman’s “Pop Bayesianism”
*August 6, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/08/06/on-first-looking-into-chapmans-pop-bayesianism/

## Summary
Key Ideas:
- The author defends Bayesianism as a genuine epistemology and posits two alternative epistemologies.
- Bayesianism is described as the synthesis of Aristotelianism and Anton-Wilsonism.
- The author argues that people don't have coherent philosophical foundations for non-idiocy, but probability theory and Bayesianism can provide that foundation.

Key Learnings:
- Bayesianism allows for the quantification of belief and updating beliefs with evidence.
- Aristotelianism is characterized by deductive reasoning and belief in unequivocal truth or falsehood.
- Anton-Wilsonism perceives belief as dogma and posits no certainty.

Key Questions:
- Do most people think in a black and white worldview?
- Is using numerical values a good way to approach uncertainty?
- Do people use numerical probabilities in everyday situations of uncertainty?

# Extreme Mnemonics
*August 14, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/08/14/extreme-mnemonics/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The difficulty in learning science subjects is the lack of semantic cues in their structures.
- It is easier to remember structures when they are loaded with human-accessible meaning.
- The isomorphism between complicated structures in science and those in fictional works, like Game of Thrones, could be exploited to make science learning easier.
- The social data that people acquire seems less susceptible to decay from disuse than scientific data.

Key learnings
- Using a story or a fictional work with an isomorphic structure can supplement traditional science textbooks.
- The use of actors in an adaptation can facilitate another level of encoding in the students' memory.

Key questions
- Is it possible to produce a story as enjoyable as Game of Thrones which is isomorphic to the most important pathways in molecular biology?
- What type of field of study might be more amenable to this kind of treatment than biology?

# Fermat’s Last Stand: Soundtrack and Adventure Log
*August 17, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/08/17/fermats-last-stand-soundtrack-and-adventure-log/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Summary of a Dungeons and Discourse adventure called Fermat's Last Stand.
- A group of adventurers, led by Princess Cerune, encounters obstacles and challenges such as the Slough of Anarchy and battling Friedrich Nietzsche.
- They eventually reach Origin and meet the Wizard of 0=Z, who sends them on a mission to find the broom of the Wicked Witch of the Negative X Coordinate in exchange for answering Cerune's question about the Bayesian Conspiracy.
- The group meets Simone de Beauvoir and works with her to expose the Wizard as Rene Descartes and leave him in power to prevent further bloodshed.
- The group decides to journey -yward to Cyberia to find the Turing Oracle.
- The group travels to Omelas and discovers a tragedy in a village surrounding the main export, benthamite.
- The group encounters a Utility Monster, debates over utilitarian doctrines, and ends up lost in a subterranean tunnel system.
- The group learns that a protective force-field around the City of Omelas prevents entry or exit due to the Sorcerer besieging the city.
- The group infiltrates the Sorcerer's war-camp successfully, discovers the Sorcerer's true name, and defeats him.
- The Mathematical Pirates consider murdering their captain, Laplace, to prevent him from pursuing Fermat’s Last Obelisk
- Laplace escapes with the Shroud of Turing and his trove of clues and maps to the treasure
- The Mathematical Pirates join forces with the Empirical Pirates and land on the supposed location of Terra Fermat
- They enter a temple where they face deadly traps and puzzles
- Laplace reveals himself and explains his true goal – to find a different treasure beyond the comprehension of the treasure-seekers
- Laplace disappears with the Eye of Aixitl and leaves behind Laplace’s Demon, a creature that attacks the adventurers
- The demon is defeated, but three members of the party die
- The four survivors discover a golden obelisk containing a message about Fermat’s Last Theorem
- Their ship is burned by Laplace, leaving them stranded on the island

Key learnings:
- The importance of working together as a team to overcome obstacles.
- The value of seeking knowledge and answers to important questions.
- The importance of questioning authority and exposing deception if necessary.
- The potential costs of utilizing utilitarian principles, especially those related to sacrifice, are discussed.
- The group navigates ethical dilemmas and debates over the legitimacy of different philosophical fields of inquiry, such as theology and language philosophy.
- The power of knowledge, especially that gained through inquiry, experimentation, and the pursuit of truth, is highlighted.
- The obsession with a goal can lead to extreme actions and disregard for others’ lives
- The pursuit of wealth and knowledge can obscure one’s morality and true intentions
- Hope can be maintained amidst setbacks and losses

Key questions:
- What is the Bayesian Conspiracy and why does Cerune want information about it?
- Who is the Wicked Witch of the Negative X Coordinate and why does the Wizard want her broom?
- What is the true nature of the Wizard of 0=Z and why did he pretend to possess magical powers?
- Who or what is the Turing Oracle and how will the group find it?
- What are the ethical implications of utilitarianism and how does it impact the characters' decision-making processes?
- How does the pursuit of knowledge impact the story's plot and characters?
- How does the use of language and the knowledge of true names impact the story's themes and plot development?
- Will the surviving adventurers be rescued or find a way off the island?
- Will they continue to pursue Laplace and uncover the conspiracy?
- Is there a chance that the lost treasure and Fermat’s Last Theorem can still be discovered?

# Things I Don’t Understand About Genetics (A Non-Exhaustive List)
*August 23, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/08/23/things-i-dont-understand-about-genetics-a-non-exhaustive-list/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) show low contributions from any particular single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in relation to intelligence.
- People differ a lot in terms of intelligence, suggesting that the genetic component of intelligence variability is either huge, or intelligence variability is not simple and additive, or the math is wrong.
- There is a possibility that many genes for good intelligence are correlated.
- The total possible genetic variability in intelligence is suggested to be huge or intelligence variability is non-simple and non-additive.
- The mutational load may explain correlations between the goodness or badness of the entire genome.
- Correlations between traits such as intelligence, height, athletic ability, and health may exist but are not as high as expected.
- The author is unsure about the paternal age effect and the viability of evolution to eliminate people with bad genes.

Key learnings:
- Intelligence is highly heritable.
- While GWAS found low contributions from any particular SNP, combining two million SNPs could explain about 2% of the variation in educational attainment across individuals.
- The genetic component of intelligence variability is complex.

Key questions:
- Should all genetics studies be performed by organizations whose acronyms are also amino acid codons?
- How does polygenic inheritance work?
- Why aren't things more correlated if there is a significant IQ variation within the same family or population group?
- What is the paternal age effect?
- How efficient is evolution in eliminating people with bad genes?

# Fake Consensualism
*August 25, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/08/25/fake-consensualism/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Studies show that even patients who legally and explicitly state they don't want health care often receive it against their wishes
- The author proposes banning health care as a solution to prevent people from being coerced into receiving it
- The author introduces the BETA-MEALR political party which advocates for banning not just health care, but also other activities such as marriage, religion, and social gatherings
- Concern for people’s preferences can be used to camouflage personal beliefs or biases against others.
- Decisions made based on one’s value system should not be imposed on others.
- Increasing the certainty of genuine consent is essential through measures such as giving people a Basic Income Guarantee.

Key learnings:
- Consent is a useful semi-neutral principle that allows for individual autonomy and supports moral autonomy
- Fake consensualism often arises when people falsely claim that their opposition to an activity is motivated by concerns about consent, but instead arises from nonconsensual reasons
- Taboo tradeoffs, which involve trading a sacred value against a secular value, often lead to moral outrage
- An individual’s concern for people’s preferences should not be used to impose their own beliefs.
- Deciding based on one’s value system should not interfere with the choices of others.
- Ensuring genuine consent is a top priority.

Key questions:
- Can banning health care truly solve the issue of coerced treatment?
- Does consent always require complete understanding and independence from external factors, or is it possible to give genuine consent even when external pressure exists?
- Is it possible to balance sacred and secular values in a way that is fair and equitable for all?
- How do we differentiate between concern for people’s preferences and personal biases?
- To what extent should an individual’s value system influence their decisions?
- How can we ensure genuine consent in all aspects of life?

# Fake Euthanasia Statistics
*August 29, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/08/29/fake-euthanasia-statistics/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The article "The Netherlands’ Euthanasia Stats Are Appalling" brings up questionable medical data on euthanasia in the Netherlands.
- Statistics presented in the article are derived from the Remmelink Report, which also includes several categories of non-euthanasia incidents and events that are currently legal in the US.
- Patients who are near the end of their life being given high doses of drugs for relief and withdrawal of treatment without patient consent classifies as "euthanized without consent" in the article.
- The Netherlands' incidence of euthanasia is often misinterpreted by opponents of euthanasia.
- The number of patients killed without consent decreased significantly after euthanasia was legalized.
- The majority of cases of patients killed without consent were justified, and the incidence of this practice is lower in the Netherlands compared to other European countries.
- Actual euthanasia affects a small percentage of deaths in the Netherlands and is done in accordance with strict guidelines and patient requests.

Key learnings:
- Patients being given high doses of drugs and withdrawal of treatment without patient consent does not classify as euthanasia and is currently legal in the US.
- The Remmelink Report is where the article derives its statistics, but there are several inconsistencies with the article's usage of the data.
- The incidence of euthanasia has been decreasing in the Netherlands since 2005.
- The use of potentially deadly symptom-relieving drugs has increased over the period euthanasia has been more legal.
- Euthanasia is less common among elderly patients than among younger cancer patients.
- The legalization of euthanasia did not result in a slippery slope for medical end-of-life practices.

Key questions:
- What are the differences between euthanasia, giving too-high doses of drugs, and withdrawal of treatment in medical situations?
- How do patients and families prepare and consent to end-of-life decisions?
- What are other factors that contribute to people avoiding death under euthanasia?
- How does the incidence of euthanasia in the Netherlands compare to other countries where it is legalized or illegal?
- How have attitudes towards end-of-life care in the Netherlands changed since the legalization of euthanasia?
- What are the main criticisms of euthanasia in the Netherlands, and how do they compare to the available data?

# Military Strikes Are An Extremely Cheap Way To Help Foreigners
*August 30, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/08/30/military-strikes-are-an-extremely-cheap-way-to-help-foreigners/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Scott disagrees with the Slate article about military intervention being too expensive to help foreigners.
- Scott argues that defunding policies, (such as PBS or publicly-subsidized preschools) because they're not as effective as GiveWell's top-rated charity is not a good idea.
- Scott calculates that military intervention in Libya saved 25,000 lives and provided up to 16 million QALYs at $65 per QALY, which is cheaper than the Against Malaria Foundation ($75 per QALY).
- Scott thinks that a utilitarian US Air Force would require a charity like GiveWell at least for a while rather than selling its planes for scrap and donating to a civilian version.

Key learnings
- Focus on cost-effective and efficient policies to achieve humanitarian goals.
- Defunding policies based on effectiveness alone is not a good idea.
- Evaluate policies on a case-to-case basis and factor in their cost-effectiveness.

Key questions
- Should the US government have policies that require it to spend money only on the most effective things and then move to the second-most effective once number one is saturated?
- Is defunding policies that produce less utility than tax cuts or typical government policy a better policy?
- What is the value proposition of using an explosives-heavy approach to humanitarianism, and what are its predictable side-effects?

# The Life Cycle of Medical Ideas
*September 12, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/09/12/the-life-cycle-of-medical-ideas/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Grey medicine refers to medical ideas that seem like they would probably work, but don't yet have larger, definitive studies to prove their efficacy.
- There are often bureaucratic, financial, or social factors that can prevent grey medicine from receiving proper attention.
- Examples of grey medicine include Dr. Zamboni's MS cure, Gat and Goren's prostate treatment, and minocycline for schizophrenia.
- Sometimes, older, unsexy treatments are the ones that actually work.

Key learnings:
- The medical community responds correctly to grey medicine by preaching caution and launching studies to investigate the theories.
- Drug companies don't suppress promising medications so much as they selectively allocate time and resources to un-suppressing beneficial drugs.
- Medical professionals are typically conservative when it comes to treatments and tend to stick with the tried-and-true methods unless presented with solid evidence to the contrary.

Key questions:
- How can bureaucratic barriers to research be overcome to speed up the process of proving or disproving medical hypotheses?
- Is there a more effective way to allocate resources and funding towards pursuing promising medical ideas?
- How can promising medical ideas gain traction in the medical community without large, expensive studies?

# Inefficient Hot Dogs
*September 18, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/09/18/inefficient-hot-dogs/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Why do hot dogs come in packs of ten and buns in packs of eight?
- This equilibrium shouldn't last in a free market.
- Companies should offer what consumers are looking for.

Key learnings
- Companies may not respond to incentives for indefinite periods of time based on tradition.
- Even seemingly trivial issues can reveal larger economic phenomena.

Key questions
- Why do companies fail to respond to consumer demand in some cases?
- How does tradition impact market equilibrium?

# Scientific Freud
*September 19, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/09/19/scientific-freud/

## Summary
Key ideas
- A study found that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) was not significantly better than psychodynamic therapy in treating major depression.
- Other studies and meta-analyses have also found no significant difference between the two therapies.
- There may be flaws in the use of placebos in therapy studies, which affects the evidence base for both psychoanalytic and cognitive-behavioral therapies.
- The Dodo Bird Verdict suggests that all psychotherapies work mainly because of the therapist's empathy and caring attitude, rather than specific techniques or theories.
- Cognitive-behavioral therapy may be seen as evidence-based because only CBT practitioners conducted studies on its efficacy, while psychoanalysts did not.

Key learnings
- The evidence for both cognitive-behavioral therapy and psychodynamic therapy is not reliable due to issues with placebo therapy and the Dodo Bird Verdict.
- Studies on the efficacy of a therapy should be conducted by practitioners of different schools of psychotherapy to reduce bias and increase the reliability of the results.

Key questions
- If cognitive-behavioral therapy is not significantly better than psychodynamic therapy, does that mean the former does not work either?
- What can be used as a reliable placebo therapy in psychotherapy studies?
- Why did cognitive-behavioral therapy become known as evidence-based while psychoanalysis did not when both have similarly unreliable evidence bases?

# The Thin Blue Line That Stays Strangely Horizontal
*September 21, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/09/21/the-thin-blue-line-that-stays-bizarrely-horizontal/

## Summary
Key ideas
- NOMINATE is a statistical system that determines which legislators are more liberal or conservative than others.
- Long-term legislators can be used to "bridge" different sections of Congress.
- DW-NOMINATE is an enhanced version of NOMINATE that can compare different sections of Congress.
- DW-NOMINATE has been recognized as broadly accurate and is used by Nate Silver.

Key learnings
- Congress is getting more polarized recently, and the Republicans took a big turn to the right starting in 1980.
- There has been no liberal drift of either party over the past 120 years according to DW-NOMINATE.

Key questions
- How can it be possible that there has been no liberal drift of either party over the past 120 years?
- Is it kosher to use DW-NOMINATE data to make time comparisons?

# Prediction is very difficult, especially of the past
*September 24, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/09/24/prediction-is-very-difficult-especially-of-the-past/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The author conducted a test to see if people could accurately predict changes in American values over time.
- The test asked for three things: the percentage of Americans who agree with certain statements, the change in percentage since 1987, and the political position of the person taking the test.
- The author hypothesized that most people would underestimate the strength of their political position due to the underdog effect.
- The author acknowledges that the test is flawed due to potential differences in wording from the original survey.

Key learnings
- The author will post the answers and data from the test soon.
- The test was not rigged and the author did not peek at the answers.
- The test may not be completely accurate due to differences in wording from the original survey.

Key questions
- How accurate were people in predicting changes in American values over time?
- Will the results confirm the author’s hypothesis about the underdog effect?
- How will Neoreactionaries, who believe in the power of the Cathedral, perform on the test?

# The Trend Evaluation Of All Values
*September 25, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/09/25/the-trend-evaluation-of-all-values/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- 170 people predicted the percentage of Americans agreeing with vague political statements
- People were terrible at predicting the percentages, with an average error of 15% per issue
- The predictions were overestimating the degree society has shifted to the left, by a tiny amount of one percentage point per issue
- Athrelon and JRM were the most accurate in predicting the answers

Key learnings:
- Polling is not always accurate
- People tend to overestimate the degree to which society has shifted to the left

Key questions:
- How can polling methods be improved?
- What are the potential consequences of overestimating the degree of society's leftward shift?
- Can predictions made by individuals be used to inform policy decisions?

# Sleep – Now By Prescription
*September 28, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/09/28/sleep-now-by-prescription/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Sleep medications are often either dangerous or ineffective.
- Ramelteon is a sleep medication that selectively binds to melatonin receptors.
- Melatonin is a natural hormone that is available as an over-the-counter supplement and is safe and effective at promoting sleep.
- A head-to-head trial between Ramelteon and melatonin has never been performed.
- The lack of availability of melatonin in hospitals is a concerning reflection of how basic and useful human hormones can be excluded from medicine.

Key learnings
- Melatonin is a natural hormone that promotes sleep and is available as an over-the-counter supplement.
- Ramelteon is a sleep medication that selectively binds to melatonin receptors and is safe and effective at promoting sleep.
- It is uncertain whether Ramelteon or melatonin is more effective at promoting sleep because a head-to-head trial has never been performed.
- The lack of availability of melatonin in hospitals is concerning because it reflects how basic and useful human hormones can be excluded from medicine.

Key questions
- Why did Ramelteon need to be created if melatonin is safe, effective, and readily available?
- Why has there not been a head-to-head trial between Ramelteon and melatonin?
- How can basic and useful human hormones like melatonin be excluded from medicine?

# The Anti-Reactionary FAQ
*October 20, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/10/20/the-anti-reactionary-faq/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The Anti-Reactionary FAQ was written to rebut the common beliefs of the political movement called Reaction or Neoreaction.
- While some of the arguments in favor of Reactionary positions may have validity, others do not.
- The Reactionary movement is not unified and has different beliefs regarding the ideal form of government.
- The blog post analyzes various claims made by reactionaries about the state of modern societies.
- These claims include increasing crime rates, decreasing happiness, and declining civic participation.
- The author examines data and evidence to refute these claims and presents counterarguments.
- The Reactionary argument for traditional monarchy is based on monarchs being secure, allowing them to ignore their own position and optimize for improving the country.
- Monarchies are perceived as less oppressive than dictatorships and democracies because their rulers can let people say and do whatever they want, knowing that their words and plans will have no effect.
- Kings and emperors rarely engage in mass murder against their own people, unlike demotist leaders in democracies and dictatorships.
- Reactionaries believe monarchies are better than democracies because the latter engages in mass murder and genocides.
- Monarchies have a much bloodier history as compared to democracies.
- Monarchies are not immune to having "stupid or psycho" leaders.
- Monarchies have been historically unstable, prone to dynastic disputes and succession squabbles
- Democracies have a simple and unambiguous decision-making procedure and provide an outlet for dissent
- Austria-Hungary's economic growth was due to its country not being as developed as its European counterparts
- The German Empire was created to turn Germany into an efficient modern state and was reliant on both conservative and progressive elements
- Progressive societies tend to be more successful in history
- The author proposes a thought experiment comparing North Korea and South Korea as a controlled experiment in applying different ideologies.
- The concept of progressivism is analyzed as a possible secular strain of Protestant religion.
- The author argues that progressivism is arbitrary and parochial rather than derived from universal moral principles.
- The idea of a "Cathedral" is introduced as a group of organizations (media, academia, etc.) that promulgate progressive ideas.
- The process that pushed Rome to the left could be doing the same to the modern world.
- The history of modern progressivism pre-dates institutions like Harvard and the New York Times.
- Modern progressivism isn't linked to Harvard or the Times in space either.
- Society has shifted leftward most quickly and dramatically on issues involving women and minorities.
- Progress comes from societies moving from traditional and survival values to secular-rational and self-expression values.
- The most progressive countries today tend to be very wealthy, very peaceful, and comparatively urbanized.
- Wealth and urbanization have forced adaptations in modern societies, such as the welfare state and socialized healthcare.
- Modern gender roles are a result of effective contraception.
- Multiculturalism and secularism are more viable options in urban societies.
- Expectations for progress in social institutions are supported by empirical results, better data, and social evolution.
- The US cannot be classified as a communist country.
- The idea of ruling a country as a joint-stock corporation has some conceptual problems.
- A corporate state could be run by shareholders and CEOs like a corporation
- The goal of a corporate state would be to maximize profits and shareholder value
- The incentives and structure of corporations may not translate well to running a country
- Moldbug proposes a system where citizens are guaranteed government-provided jobs at a living wage, but the jobs are useless make-work jobs.
- Moldbug also proposes a system where the elderly and unproductive are placed under the care of a patron, potentially re-inventing slavery.
- Moldbug's Virtual Option proposal involves housing people in virtual reality pods, but this is impractical and costly.
- Reactioanries support exit rights, but people are rooted in their property, family, and jobs.
- Some Reactionaries argue that modern women are sluts, but studies show that women are not actually having significantly more heterosexual sex than men.

- The disappearance of historical arguments against sluttiness has left behind only a feeling of disgust in search of justification.
- The correlation between rising divorce rates and progressive values is not as straightforward as some may believe, and people with more progressive values are actually less likely to divorce.
- The US and Western Europe are not facing demographic collapse, and fears about fertility rates among white people are unfounded.
- The dysgenic effect of higher fertility rates among low-IQ populations is too small to be significant.
- Stereotyping and discrimination based on race, sexuality, and gender have existed throughout history and continue to be prevalent.
- The debate over equality of opportunity versus equality of results is moot until there is an actual equality of opportunity.
- The idea that all racial disparities are due to discrimination is not a universally held belief, even among black people.
- The rise of extremist social justice movements on the internet is partly due to the anonymity that the medium provides.

- Examination of the possibility of sustaining a type of colonialism without the evil, due to modern progressive ideals
- Evaluation of the claims of leftist bias and historical rewrites in schools
- Acknowledgment of the potential merit of Reactionary ideas, while also recognizing the faults in their narrative

- A list of responses to the FAQ has been compiled.

Key learnings:
- The author examines various indicators of societal decline to determine whether Progressivism is causing decay.
- The author concludes that the evidence presented by Reactionaries to support their thesis is unconvincing.
- Rather than being in an era of severe decline, many indicators of societal health are trending positively.
- Many reactionary claims about the state of modern society are not supported by data.
- Some indicators of social success, such as global illiteracy and poverty rates, have shown significant improvement.
- Progress in areas such as healthcare and technology have played a role in improving social outcomes.
- Actual monarchies are less stable and more oppressive than the idealized view presented by Reactionaries.
- The use of the term "demotist" to group together countries that rule in the name of the people in order to prove a point is made-up and irrelevant to liberal democracies.
- The use of made-up categories to prove a point is a logical fallacy.
- Liberal democracies have a much better history than monarchies.
- A monarch's "stupid or psycho" tendencies cannot be predicted with certainty.
- Traditional monarchies may not be more politically or economically stable than democracies
- Progressivism does not inhibit economic growth according to statistical evidence
- The success of a nation may be due to a combination of conservative and progressive elements
- The author suggests that authoritarianism and a hereditary absolute monarchy are more effective than democracy and market capitalism.
- The author argues that progressivism is not rooted in universal moral principles and originates from certain religious traditions.
- The author introduces the idea of a "Cathedral" as a group of organizations pushing for progressive policies.
- Whatever advantage the left has, it must be something skew to politics, something that institutionalized leftism can neither predict nor control.
- The rural/urban divide mirrors the traditional/survival-self-expression dimensions, where more rural countries tend to be more traditional/survival and more urban countries tend to be more secular-rational/self-expression.
- The factors of wealth and urbanization have driven much of the modern adaptations in social institutions, such as the welfare state and socialized healthcare.
- Ideas such as secularism and multiculturalism have become increasingly viable options in urban societies.
- Progress in social institutions can be expected due to empirical results, better data, and social evolution.
- Shareholder value maximization may not lead to a nicer place to live for everyone
- Corporate governance may not have lower discount rates or better long-term planning than governments
- Cryptographic locks on weapons may not prevent all types of rebellions
- Moldbug's proposals have similarities to Communism and bureaucratic slavery.
- The Virtual Option proposal is not practical with current technology and could be more expensive than other options.
- Exit rights may not be effective due to people being rooted in their communities.
- Common perceptions about women being "sluttier" may not be accurate.
- The stigmatization of female sluttiness is not justified by historical arguments, and the concerns that led to this stigmatization are largely addressed by modern technology.
- Progressive values are not the cause of rising divorce rates, and people with more progressive values are actually less likely to have broken families.
- The US and Western Europe are not facing a demographic catastrophe, and fears about fertility rates among white people are unfounded.
- The dysgenic effect of higher fertility rates among low-IQ populations is too small to be significant.
- The author believes that real progressivism is based on Enlightenment values of free speech, color-blindness, and lack of segregation.
- Equality of opportunity is a necessary precursor to debating equality of results.
- The rise of extremist social justice movements is not necessarily indicative of an increase in support for their beliefs.
- The debate on colonialism is multi-faceted and involves considerations of politics, economics, and human rights.
- Decolonization resulted in disasters as well, and the potential advantages of colonialism must be weighed against these costs.
- Modern progressive ideals may theoretically sustain a colonialism that avoids human rights abuses, but it is difficult to imagine such a nation existing.
- The claims of leftist bias in schools may not have a strong basis.
- Reactionary ideas may offer beneficial insights, but their narrative must be examined critically.
- Utopianism can be a useful tool for generating ideas and starting intentional communities.
- There are other alternatives to Reactionary ideas for new forms of government.

## Summary
Key ideas:

# The Poor You Will Always Have With You
*October 31, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/10/31/the-poor-you-will-always-have-with-you/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Scott Alexander argues that classical Rome shared many policies associated with progressivism, such as welfare, religious syncretism, and sexual libertinism.
- Habitable Worlds disagrees with this point, arguing that progressive policies emerge from ideals of morality, justice, oppression, and rights that were not present in ancient Rome.
- The article explores the differences in motive and philosophical justifications for welfare policies in ancient Rome versus modern progressivism.
- The author compares ancient Rome and modern America in terms of their militarily security, economic advancement, multiculturalism, and urbanization.
- The author argues that ancient Rome could be considered a progressive society due to similarities in social policies and outcomes.
- The author states that the particular brand of progressive philosophy is irrelevant to the assessment of a society's progressiveness.

Key learnings:
- The similarity of policies between ancient Rome and modern progressivism may not necessarily signify similar underlying motives.
- The author proposes a model in which social change leads to progressive values, rather than the other way around.
- Comparing ancient Rome to modern progressivism can shed light on the underlying philosophical justifications for different welfare policies.
- Social policies and outcomes are more important than philosophical beliefs when assessing a society's progressiveness.
- It is possible to compare societies across different time periods by evaluating their military security, economic status, multiculturalism, and urbanization.

Key questions:
- Did the poor in ancient Rome receive welfare because they deserved it or because of political motives?
- How do the philosophical justifications for welfare policies in ancient Rome differ from those in modern progressivism?
- How can comparing ancient Rome to modern progressivism help us understand the underlying values and motives driving policy decisions?
- Could other historical societies be considered progressive under the same criteria as ancient Rome?
- What factors besides military security, economic advancement, multiculturalism, and urbanization should be considered when comparing societies?
- Are there any negative social outcomes in modern America that were not present in ancient Rome?

*November 8, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/11/08/lies-damned-lies-and-facebook-part-4-of-%e2%88%9e/

## Summary
Key ideas:

Key learnings:
-Second derivatives, or changes in the change, can be used to measure the effects of anti-rape campaigns targeting men.
-The evidence that anti-rape campaigns targeting men work is weak and requires further study.

Key questions:

# Highlights From My Notes From A Forensic Psychiatry Conference Last Week
*November 10, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/11/10/highlights-from-my-notes-from-a-forensic-psychiatry-conference-last-week/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The insanity defense is not overused.
- A successful plea of insanity results in a longer confinement in forensic hospitals than in prisons for sane felons.
- Juries are not allowed to be informed about what will happen to defendants if they return a certain verdict.
- Forensic psychiatrists are effective at determining which criminals who plead insanity are “faking it”.
- Real mentally retarded people perform at chance on medium and difficult multiple-choice vocabulary test questions.

Key learnings
- The insanity defense is not a good legal strategy due to its low success rate and the increase in the time spent in confinement.
- The general public has a false perception of what happens to felons found insane due to legal restrictions on juries.
- Forensic psychiatrists have become adept at identifying fake claims of mental illness, making it difficult for criminals to successfully plead insanity.
- Real mentally retarded people perform at chance on medium and difficult lexical questions and are easily distinguishable from fakers.

Key questions
- Why do so few cases use the insanity defense despite the popular belief of its overuse?
- What can be done to ensure juries have complete information when making their verdicts?
- How can the public's perception of how the legal system deals with felons found insane be corrected?
- What are the implications of advancements in forensic psychiatry on the legal field, particularly on the use of the insanity defense?
- What other factors should be considered when vetting potential jurors for capital cases?

https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/11/28/the-story-of-thanksgiving-is-a-science-fiction-story/

## Summary
Key ideas:

- Humans are capable of both kindness and cruelty, as are aliens.
- Manipulation and bluffing can be powerful tools in uniting people.
- Legends and history can be easily forgotten and altered.

Key questions:

# Links for December
*December 1, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/12/01/links-for-december/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The impact of teachers extends beyond test scores, with students potentially earning higher salaries and living in higher socioeconomic neighborhoods if they have good teachers.
- A study found that paying students for performance on IQ tests can lead to an improvement of up to 20 IQ points, suggesting motivation plays a significant role.
- LA passed a law requiring condoms in all porn videos, which resulted in 95% of the industry leaving the city and making condom-free videos elsewhere, demonstrating a flaw in the law-making process.
- Research suggests that as much as 26% of children's psychological adjustment is impacted by how much they perceive themselves to be accepted or rejected by their major caregivers.
- The implicit association test is now being used to predict the success or failure of a marriage.

Key learnings:
- Good teachers can significantly impact a student's life outcomes beyond test scores.
- Monetary incentives may increase motivation and performance.
- Laws such as LA's condom requirement for porn companies may have unintended consequences.
- Children's perception of acceptance or rejection impacts their psychological adjustment.
- The implicit association test's applications extend beyond identifying racism and can predict the success or failure of a marriage.

Key questions:
- What can we do to attract and retain good teachers?
- How can we use monetary incentives to motivate and increase performance in other areas?
- How can lawmakers prevent unintended consequences of their legislation?
- How can we ensure that children feel accepted and avoid negative impacts on their psychological adjustment?
- What other applications can the implicit association test be used for?

# Empire/Forest Fire
*December 1, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/12/01/empireforest-fire/

## Summary
Key ideas 
- Two bloggers propose a concept called the "left singularity" where the shift to the left leads to instability and collapse.
- The author challenges this idea citing cases in history where oppressive monarchies often led to reigns of terror, while democracy and leftism did not. 
- The author proposes an alternate model where a strong repressive monarchy is overthrown, followed by a naïve revolution, and eventually a reign of terror, ending with intervention, and finally, a more mellow government.

Key learnings
- Historical examples suggest that oppressive monarchies and strong right-wing dictatorships are more prone to initiating reigns of terror as compared to democracy and leftism.
- Moderate-left ideas do not necessarily lead to a reign of terror, contrary to what is proposed by the left singularity concept.
- Democratic nations with free speech and fair elections are less likely to experience reigns of terror.

Key questions
- What is the left singularity, and how does it propose the shift to the left leads to instability and collapse? 
- What is the author's alternate model, and how does it support the idea that oppressive monarchies lead to reigns of terror? 
- Can a good example of a reign of terror be found in a nation that has been a stable democracy for at least one generation beforehand?

# A Something Sort Of Like Left-Libertarianism-ist Manifesto
*December 8, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/12/08/a-something-sort-of-like-left-libertarianism-ist-manifesto/

## Summary
Key ideas:

# Papal PR
*December 12, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/12/12/papal-pr/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Pope Francis being Time’s Person of the Year for his heart-warming deeds.
- The author doesn't understand why people focus on these deeds so much.
- Wearings flag pins or visiting places like Arlington Cemetery are signals of patriotism for presidents.
- The author doubts why the previous popes didn't do similar deeds, like abandoning the papal luxury palace for a humble apartment.
- The author is not accusing Pope Francis of being shady, but if he were, he would do the same he's doing now.

Key learnings
- The article explains the reasons why Pope Francis is a heart-warming and popular figure.
- It highlights that performing humble deeds is a source of public admiration, and one of the ways that people in power increase their popularity.

Key questions
- Why do people focus on Pope Francis' deeds so much?
- Why didn't his predecessors do similar deeds in the past?
- Maybe the previous Popes believed that people would be more impressed by the golden and fancy regalia and ritual than by conspicuous humility.

# Statistical Literacy Among Doctors Now Lower Than Chance
*December 17, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/12/17/statistical-literacy-among-doctors-now-lower-than-chance/

## Summary
Key ideas
- A study of 4,000 doctors showed that only 42% of Ob/Gyn residents could correctly answer a true-false question on p-values.
- The same study showed that only 26% of doctors could answer a multiple-choice question on mammogram results, even though the question almost gave the correct answer.
- Doctors who got the statistics questions wrong were more likely to say they had good training in statistical literacy.
- Women rated their statistical literacy worse than men did, but did not actually do worse on the questions.
- Only 12% of doctors got both questions correct.

Key learnings
- Doctors' statistical knowledge may not be as good as we assume.
- Doctors who get basic statistics questions wrong may not be aware of how little they know.
- Women may underestimate their statistical knowledge compared to men.
- Even getting one question right may not make someone more likely to do well on the other.

Key questions
- Does this data suggest that doctors need more statistical education?
- Is it fair to expect doctors to know more about statistics than the general population?
- How can we ensure that doctors have the statistical knowledge they need to make informed decisions?

# Less Wrong, More Rite (II)
*December 18, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/12/18/less-wrong-more-rite-ii/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The Rationalist Solstice Ritual is often criticized but still enjoyable and helps create community.
- The cringeworthiness of a religion or belief system can attract people to it because it creates an in-group with a significant separation from the out-group.
- Atheists face obstacles in building community because of their scattered nature and differences in beliefs apart from atheism itself.
- The modern atheist movement has several strategies to solve the problem of building community, including ignoring or exaggerating negative aspects of religion or focusing on a more specific sub-movement.
- The rationalist movement naturally creates a strong community due to its different ways of thinking.
- There is not a lack of good art about atheism, but rather atheists create art about the same things as anyone else.
- The "missing atheist music" is found in songs written by nonreligious or ambiguously spiritual people about progressive values, unity, etc.

Key learnings:
- Separating oneself from the out-group and having a unique way of looking at the world can create a stronger community.
- Building a community of atheists comes with significant obstacles due to scattered population and differences in beliefs.
- Focusing on a sub-movement or specific belief can help strengthen the atheist community.

Key questions:
- What is the rationalist movement, and how does it differ from traditional atheism?
- Why is it easier for some religions to create a strong community than for atheists?
- How can atheists overcome the obstacles they face in building community?

# Public Awareness Campaigns
*December 22, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/12/22/public-awareness-campaigns/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Public awareness campaigns have a long history of failure as well as success.
- Research on anti-rape campaigns aimed at men has zero evidence of effectiveness.
- Some successful public awareness campaigns include MADD’s campaign against drunk driving and seatbelt awareness campaigns.
- Stigmatizing campaigns can be counterproductive and cause resentment in those who are forced to endure them.
- The author believes it is difficult to predict the success or failure of future public awareness campaigns.

Key learnings:
- Tobacco and anti-drunk driving campaigns work using very graphic images of bad outcomes.
- Employing stigma can be successful, but not always.
- Captive audiences, as in DARE and sex education programs, are more likely to be counterproductive.

Key questions:
- Why do some public awareness campaigns work and others fail?
- What types of negative feelings from campaigns are more likely to be counterproductive?
- Can promoting public awareness campaigns lead to resentment in the groups they target?
- How can the success or failure of future public awareness campaigns be predicted?

# We Are All MsScribe
*December 23, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/12/23/we-are-all-msscribe/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The story of MsScribe taking over Harry Potter fandom is the perfect teaching tool for understanding the human race.
- The feud between Harry/Hermione and Harry/Ginny shippers escalated from online debate to real-world stalking and harassment.
- The conflict on various websites resulted in a status hierarchy with a few people at the top receiving much attention and affection from others.
- MsScribe used sock puppet accounts to gain more popularity and fame while at the same time launching cruel attacks on herself through racist and sexist sock puppet accounts to gain sympathy from others.
- Despite the mounting evidence that MsScribe was behind all of it, everyone continued to support her and ridicule her accusers until a fan with cancer asked for money and MsScribe's negativity caused her popularity to drop.
- Scott reflects on his life online, particularly in the geofiction/micronation community, where he and others behaved similarly to the Harry Potter fandom.
- The behavior he and others exhibited is similar to that of the Robbers' Cave experiment where boys at a camp divided themselves into groups and proceeded to hate each other.

Key learnings
- Online communities can escalate from debates to personal attacks and even real-world harassment and stalking.
- Sock puppet accounts can be used to manipulate online popularity and gain sympathy from others.
- People tend to support confirmed popular persons and ridicule their accusers, turning a blind eye to the truth.
- Conflicts can escalate to the point of people creating separate status hierarchies with some people receiving more attention and affection.
- People can form group identities and hate those in other groups, even over fictional matters like romantic pairings in a book or fictional countries.

Key questions
- What do you think causes people to escalate from online debates to personal attacks and real-world harassment and stalking?
- Can sock puppet accounts ever be used positively, such as in a marketing setting?
- Is it possible for people to remain objective in conflicts and consider evidence fairly even if it may go against their opinions or beliefs?
- What do you think can be done to prevent conflicts from escalating to the point of creating separate status hierarchies and leading to hate and backstabbing among groups?
- How can we encourage more constructive and respectful conversations and interactions online?

https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/12/24/repost-a-christmas-poem/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Adapted from Dr. Seuss's "How the Grinch Stole Christmas," this post tells a story of King Herod and his attempt to stop the Messiah and Christmas.
- King Herod steals all the children in Jewville in hopes of getting rid of the Messiah.
- King Herod has a change of heart and returns the children, celebrating Christmas with the town.

Key learnings:
- The true meaning of Christmas cannot be stolen or destroyed.
- Christmas is not solely about Jesus but about love, joy, and togetherness.

# A Comment I Posted On “What Would JT Do?”
*December 28, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/12/28/a-comment-i-posted-on-what-would-jt-do/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Constitutional freedom of speech is necessary but not sufficient for a "marketplace of ideas"
- Punishing or financially ruining those who express opposing views creates a group with more power and popularity
- A mutual truce exists that businesses should employ people based on skills and merit rather than political alliances
- When you undermine that truce, gay people are in a precarious position

Key learnings
- Constitutional freedom of speech is vital, but it's even more imperative to promote an environment in which dissenting opinions are well-tolerated.

Key questions
- How can we ensure that dissenting opinions are properly tolerated?
- How large is the gap between "constitutional freedom of religion" and what's necessary to ensure a civil society?
- How do businesses ensure that they're employing people based on their skills and merit rather than political alliances?

# The Spirit Of The First Amendment
*December 29, 2013*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/12/29/the-spirit-of-the-first-amendment/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The “Doctrine Of The Preferred First Speaker” holds that listeners should refrain from protected expression to preserve the speaker's freedom without facing non-government consequences.
- The “spirit of the First Amendment” protects the marketplace of ideas and encourages arguments backed by evidence.
- Ways to silence ideas include firing people, doxxing, and online harassment.

Key learnings:
- The marketplace of ideas should be protected, as arguments should be backed by evidence and not based on the power of proponents.
- Silencing speech does not promote free speech or equality.
- Free speech principles should not be “smuggled” with unprincipled and inconsistent concepts.

Key questions:
- What is the difference between good and bad arguments?
- What counts as a form of speech that aims to silence rather than counterargue?
- What are some ways we can protect free speech while still holding people accountable for their actions and words?

# Two Dark Side Statistics Papers
*January 2, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/01/02/two-dark-side-statistics-papers/

## Summary
Key ideas
- False Positive Psychology discusses four tricks used to artificially show statistical significance in data.
- The four tricks are measure multiple dependent variables and only report significant ones, control for confounders or subgroups and report significance there, test different conditions and choose the one with positive results, and artificially choose when to end an experiment to get desired results.
- Studies showed that using all four tricks could generate fake statistical significance 61% of the time.
- How to Have a High Success Rate in Treatment is a paper that examines how drug treatment programs can inflate their success rates.
- Treatment programs can carefully choose their denominator, select people who are more likely to succeed, redefine success, or use interval subdivision to generate higher success rates.
- Studies have shown that the placebo groups in drug treatment program studies can have anywhere from a 22.5% to 87% success rate, depending on the study protocol employed.

Key learnings
- Researchers can manipulate experimental design and data analysis to show artificial statistical significance and fool readers.
- Drug treatment programs can manipulate their success rates through various means, including redefining what success means and carefully choosing their study population.

Key questions
- How can the scientific community prevent papers with manipulated data from being published in journals?
- Should researchers be required to submit their experimental protocols to journals for acceptance or rejection in advance?
- What steps can be taken by the scientific community to reduce the prevalence of manipulated data in research studies?
- How might researchers be held accountable for publishing papers with manipulated data?

# Marijuana: Much More Than You Wanted To Know
*January 5, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/01/05/marijuana-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The author works on a Substance Abuse Team, treating people hospitalized for alcohol and drug-related problems.
- The author's attending vehemently opposes medical marijuana or any relaxation on marijuana’s status at all.
- Several states have decriminalized, legalized medical marijuana and recreational marijuana use.
- Studies examining marijuana use after liberalization suggest decriminalization led to no increase in marijuana use among teens, medical marijuana legalization caused it to increase among adults, and full legalization of marijuana in foreign countries resulted in significant but variable increases in marijuana consumption.
- Various theories behind the different results and effects of marijuana policies are discussed.
- Marijuana does not have a detectable effect on mortality or tobacco-like side effects.
- Marijuana may decrease IQ if used early and often, possibly by as many as 8 IQ points.
- Marijuana may increase the risk of psychosis by as much as 40%, but it’s unclear who is at risk or whether the risk is real.
- The gateway drug hypothesis is complicated to evaluate, and there is no clear causal evidence in its support.
- Legalizing marijuana would free about 20,000 people from jail, prevent 700,000 arrests not resulting in jail time per year, save between $2-14 billion, and possibly reduce traffic fatalities a few percent or more.
- The costs and benefits of marijuana legalization can be analyzed using QALYs.
- The benefits come from fewer road traffic accidents, reduced prison population, and increased tax revenue.
- The costs come from lower IQ, possible addiction, and increased use.
- The net benefits depend largely on small changes in road traffic accident rates.
- There are several factors left out, including social effects of IQ loss and the impact on organized crime.

Key learnings:
- Decriminalization of marijuana has little effect on the average user and legalization of medical marijuana does not lead to an increase in teen marijuana use.
- Full legalization of marijuana may lead to significant increases in marijuana consumption.
- The effects of marijuana policies are complex, difficult to predict, and have varying effects on different groups.
- Legalizing and decriminalizing marijuana seem unalloyed good things, especially regarding medical marijuana.
- There is a lack of clear evidence on the effects of teen marijuana use after legalization.
- The cost of marijuana-related arrests and the drug war outweigh the benefits of keeping marijuana illegal.
- The costs and benefits of marijuana legalization are not clear-cut.
- Road traffic accident rates are the most important factor to consider.
- Analyzing a problem using statistics can help identify irrational thinking and lead to new ways of looking at the issue.

Key questions:
- Would relaxation of penalties on marijuana increase or decrease marijuana use among adults?
- What are the effects of full legalization of marijuana in the United States?
- What are the possible reasons for the different results and effects of different marijuana policies?
- Is it worth the risk to mental health to use marijuana recreationally?
- Would legalizing marijuana increase overall drug use?
- How can society best address the impact of drug cartels?
- How can the government provide support for those arrested for marijuana-related offenses?
- How much does marijuana use contribute to road traffic accidents, and how can this be further studied?
- What are the wider social effects of a loss of IQ points?
- How can we prevent marijuana legalization from becoming a source of funding for organized crime?

# Aretaeus On Bipolar Disorder
*January 12, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/01/12/areteaus-on-bipolar-disorder/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The American hegemony may result in declaring America's types of mental illness as "real" and their forms alone
- Every culture has culture-bound syndromes
- Aretaeus of Cappadocia, a 1st century AD Greco-Roman physician, described bipolar disorder almost exactly as it is described today
- Aretaeus gets 13/23 of the same criteria we use today

Key learnings
- People with bipolar disorder in ancient Rome behave similarly to people with bipolar disorder today
- The disorder is firmly biologically grounded and not culture-bound

Key questions
- What are culture-bound syndromes?
- Is the American hegemony responsible for promoting the idea that America's types of illnesses are the only "real" illnesses?
- Is it possible that other forms of mental illnesses exist that we have not yet categorized?

# A Response To Apophemi on Triggers
*January 12, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/01/12/a-response-to-apophemi-on-triggers/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Apophemi has requested that people should not discuss controversial and potentially triggering topics dispassionately, and instead should respect boundaries that marginalized people have set.
- The author thinks that the rationalist community should be a safe space for people who obsessively focus on reason and argument, where they can speak freely without fear of ridicule or attack.
- The author also suggests that the idea of safe spaces can conflict with one another, and that the rationalist community's safe space should focus on free discourse.
- The author discusses the concept of triggers and how it affects people's reactions to social justice issues.
- The author argues that there are two solutions to dealing with triggers: "my triggers are important, your triggers are invalid" and the safe space solution.
- The author presents the idea that everyone is broken, and that even people from privileged backgrounds have triggers.
- The author addresses the challenge of the lack of diversity in certain communities and proposes two possible explanations.
- Language can be used to marginalize and hurt people, even if the words themselves seem neutral or innocent.
- Attempting to avoid hurting people through political correctness can go too far, but this does not mean that it is always wrong or unnecessary.
- Terminology preferences can vary widely within different communities, and it is important to respect individual and group preferences.
- Gender-targeted insults like "sluttiness" can make certain populations uncomfortable and less likely to engage with an argument.

Key learnings:
- Different groups of people may require different safe spaces in order to feel comfortable discussing sensitive issues.
- The rationalist community is particularly geared towards free, dispassionate debate about topics that involve reason and evidence.
- The author believes that if people want to discuss controversial topics while respecting marginalized peoples' boundaries, they should instead seek out specific communities that already do so.
- Triggers are a real and significant issue that need to be considered when discussing social justice.
- Safe spaces can provide a solution to those who are easily triggered, but it is not always feasible or desirable to make every discussion trigger-free.
- Everyone has biases and emotional reactions, regardless of their background or privilege.
- The lack of diversity in certain communities is a complex issue that cannot be explained by a simple dichotomy between discrimination and inherent inferiority.
- The words and language we use matter and can contribute to the marginalization or hurt of certain groups.
- It is important to be mindful of the impact that our language can have and to respect individual and group preferences for terminology.
- Insensitivity to the preferences and feelings of marginalized groups can contribute to perceptions of persecution or insensitivity to these groups.

Key questions:
- How can the rationalist community maintain a safe space for free discourse while also respecting the boundaries of marginalized people?
- How can different safe spaces avoid conflicting with one another and still serve the needs of their respective groups?
- How can individuals best navigate the potentially triggering nature of certain conversations and respect the boundaries of others while still engaging in productive dialogue?
- How can we create safe spaces without limiting free speech and open discussion?
- How can we address triggers and their impact on people's reactions to controversial issues?
- What are the root causes of the lack of diversity in certain communities, and how can we address them?
- How can we balance the desire to avoid hurting people with the need for open and honest communication?
- In what ways can language be used to marginalize and hurt people, even if the words themselves seem harmless?
- How can we best respect the preferences and experiences of different communities when it comes to language and terminology?

*January 15, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/01/15/ten-things-i-want-to-stop-seeing-on-the-internet-in-2014/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The use of the word "fanboy" is derogatory and assumes that liking something automatically makes someone inferior.
- The word "butthurt" is used to belittle people's feelings and lacks human decency.
- People should learn to differentiate between single data points and meaningful trends when discussing global warming.
- Memes, such as doge memes, go through stages and often lose their original humor.
- Meta-humor and certain forms of humor (such as using socio-economic status as a punchline) are lazy and unoriginal.
- Arguments about which generation is better or hating on girls with male friends are harmful and unnecessary.
- Internet language, such as the use of "dude" or "bro", has evolved to include gendered assumptions that are unhelpful.

Key learnings:
- Be mindful of language and humor that belittles people or their experiences.
- Learn to separate out individual data points from meaningful trends.
- Recognize when memes or humor have lost their original creativity.
- Avoid making gendered assumptions or punching down when using Internet language or humor.

Key questions:
- How can we shift the conversation around global warming to focus on meaningful trends?
- What are some ways to promote originality in online humor?
- How can we foster a more inclusive and respectful culture online?

# Genetic Testing and Self-Fulfilling Prophecies
*January 19, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/01/19/genetic-testing-and-self-fulfilling-prophecies/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The ApoE4 gene is a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.
- A study by Lineweaver et al tested 144 elderly adults for the ApoE4 gene and found that those who knew they had it did significantly worse on memory tests compared to those who didn't know.
- The medical community is concerned that giving people their genetic test results may be dangerous.

Key learnings
- Letting people know their genetic risks may lead to worse cognitive outcomes than if they didn't know
- However, the study does not provide enough details to understand the implications fully.

Key questions
- What methodological details were not provided, and why are they important?
- Could knowing one's genetic risks prime subjects to perform worse on tests?
- Is there a potential for harmful side effects from genetic testing?

*January 25, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/01/25/beware-mass-produced-medical-recommendations/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- A recommendation to ask about Vitamin D when evaluating supplement claims.
- The problem with being one-sided in evaluating supplement studies.
- Conflicting studies on the effectiveness of Vitamin D in preventing all-cause mortality and cancer.
- The importance of structure in achieving success
- The benefits of adhering to a predetermined schedule
- The danger of deviating from the structure

Key learnings:
- Vitamin D has more evidence against it than in favor of it.
- The recommendation for vitamin D is mostly harmless, with the purported risks on even shakier ground than the purported benefits.
- There are limitations to examining supplements that reduce the effectiveness of mass-produced medical recommendations.
- Having a well-planned structure can help one stay focused and productive
- Saying "no" to distractions is necessary to maintain the structure
- Following a structure consistently can lead to success

Key questions:
- Is Vitamin D really the supplement with the most evidence in its favor?
- How can mass-produced medical recommendations be improved?
- What happens when one deviates from the structure?
- How can one balance spontaneity with structure?
- Is there room for flexibility within a structure?

# Wirehead Gods On Lotus Thrones
*January 28, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/01/28/wirehead-gods-on-lotus-thrones/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- A vision of the far future is a "wirehead society" where posthuman descendants achieve technological omnipotence.
- In this society, economic differences will compound on a sub-second scale until different classes are so far apart that competition becomes impossible.
- Art becomes less interesting, everyone can extrapolate back from the appearance of a painting to exactly what the mental state of the artist must have been at the time it was painted.
- Science becomes less interesting, almost everything was discovered long ago.
- One approach to prevent this monotony is the imposition of artificial limits.

Key learnings:
- The pursuit of technological omnipotence leads to a society where competition becomes impossible, and everything ultimately becomes meaningless.
- Even in a perfect and utopian posthuman society, existence can still become boring.

Key questions:
- Should we impose artificial limits to prevent a "wirehead" society?
- Is it possible to maintain variety and interest in a posthuman society without imposing artificial limits?

# Based on your findings, which theory about alien thickness seems most valid or most accurate?
*February 2, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/02/based-on-your-findings-which-theory-about-alien-thickness-seems-most-valid-or-most-accurate/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- A strange search term that keeps showing up, “based on your findings, which theory about alien thickness seems most valid or most accurate?” leads to a homework question found on a 7th-grade science class.
- Question 25 on this assignment, which asks about “alien thickness,” seems to have a lack of reference to topics that had come before, so it’s reasonable to assume why all students would Google it.
- By using a web gizmo, author Scott is able to discover that alien thickness seems to be affected by temperature, which leads to a method of process of elimination to arrive at the right answer.
- Learning to eliminate wrong answers through test-taking skills can be valuable.

Key learnings:
- Alien thickness is likely affected by temperature.
- Test-taking skills such as process of elimination can often help find the right answer.

Key questions:
- What is causing the “alien thickness” search term to be so popular?
- Do the homework questions, which seem to come out of nowhere in relation to what’s been learned before, actually help students learn anything?
- What other skills are there to help people answer questions when there’s not enough information provided in the question itself?

# Seeming and Being Empathetic
*February 8, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/08/seeming-and-being-empathetic/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Medical schools use scripted responses to teach empathy to students
- Professional medical actors are not always effective in teaching empathy
- Both sides (students and actors) stick to a script, avoiding real human emotion
- Standardized tests are written to be able to hold up in court
- Actual caring is not enough, medical professionals must also appear to care

Key learnings:
- Empathy is a choice and requires exertion
- Consequentialist goals are more important in real life than virtue-ethics-y goals
- Unlearning scripted responses can help medical professionals better connect with patients

Key questions:
- Can medical schools effectively teach empathy without scripted responses?
- How can medical professionals balance appearing empathetic with genuine caring?
- What are some alternative methods for teaching empathy in medical schools?

# Blogging The Anissimov – Smith Reaction Debate
*February 11, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/11/blogging-the-anissimov-smith-reaction-debate/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Scott was excited for the video debate between Noah Smith and Michael Anissimov on neoreaction.
- Both sides were cordial and respectful, with Michael presenting his ideas as hypotheses rather than assertions.
- The debaters discussed social isolation, capitalism, equality, monarchy, and aristocracy.
- Michael's main point in pushing monarchy is the "organic state", which aims to unite everyone towards a common purpose.
- Noah argued for liberal diverse countries being more stable than "organic" countries.
- Debate on modernity and social changes

Key learnings:
- Discussions between reactionaries and nonreactionaries are hard to find.
- Happiness has generally increased in most countries in the past fifty years.
- Wealth causes modernization and collapse of traditions, rather than the opposite way around.
- Organicity is an effect rather than a cause.
- Aristocracy is high-variance.
- People in hospitals have greater variance in their level of health than people not hospitalized
- The collapse of the family has caused profound damage to society
- Traditional gender roles may be an effective way to avoid broken families

Key questions:
- How can Michael transform America's wealthy families into "real aristocrats"?
- What is the difference between an aristocracy and America's current system of passing down wealth to future generations?
- How can someone cash out the concept of status as "service to the community" in a practical sense?
- What is the proper tool for discussions about organicity - empiricism or theory?
- Can some long tail of hospital patients have better health than the non-hospitalized?
- How is a family a broken one when both parents split work and family responsibility?
- How can traditional gender roles be effectively reinstated in modern society?

# Nootropics Survey Results And Analysis
*February 16, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/16/nootropics-survey-results-and-analysis/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Nootropics are substances that are claimed to improve mental functioning.
- Some substances have been confirmed to have neuroprotective and cognitive benefits through studies.
- The online nootropics community experiments with various substances, but there is little scientific literature to support their efficacy.
- The effectiveness of various nootropics was tested through a survey of 162 respondents from online nootropics communities, with caffeine and modafinil being the most effective.
- Survey results for various nootropics
- -afinils show promise, but no "smoking gun" for any substance being definitely-exciting
- Potential for tolerance with modafinil
- Plans for future research and surveys

Key learnings:
- The nootropic community experiments with a variety of substances without being sure of their efficacy.
- The efficacy of various nootropics varies, with caffeine and modafinil being the most effective.
- Placebo effects can influence ratings of the effectiveness of nootropics.
- Dosages of nootropics do not show consistent relationships with effectiveness.
- There is a wide range of experiences and results with different nootropics
- Tolerance may be a concern with modafinil
- Future surveys should aim to have better standardization and more responses

Key questions:
- Can more standardized research be conducted to properly assess the effectiveness of nootropics?
- How can the effects of placebo be minimized in testing the effectiveness of nootropics?
- How can dosages of nootropics be properly established to maximize their effectiveness?
- Which nootropics show the most promising results?
- How should dose-response relationships be analyzed in future surveys?
- Are there ways to better standardize ratings and responses?

# Lies, Damned Lies, And Social Media (Part 5 of ∞)
*February 17, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/17/lies-damned-lies-and-social-media-part-5-of-%e2%88%9e/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- An article claiming that men are unlikely to be falsely accused of rape is based on incorrect statistics.
- The calculation used to determine the odds of false accusations is flawed.
- The rate of false accusations is difficult to study, and there is some uncertainty around the accuracy of reported statistics.
- The possibility of unreported false accusations exists, and false accusers may not feel incentivized to go through the legal process.
- Scott argues that false rape accusations can have serious consequences and that statistics about the likelihood of being falsely accused of rape are often inaccurate.
- He notes that people sometimes believe and spread false information without thinking critically about it and encourages readers to be wary of highly charged political blogospheres.
- Scott also discusses the "just world fallacy" and how it can lead people to dismiss the possibility that false accusations of rape can happen.

Key learnings:
- False accusations of rape are not as rare as some articles suggest.
- Statistics around false accusations may not accurately capture the true rates due to different reporting and methodology.
- False accusations can have severe consequences for those accused, and the topic should be approached with sensitivity and care.
- False accusations of rape can have a profound impact on people's lives.
- The accuracy of statistics about false rape accusations is often questionable.
- People should be cautious about accepting information without thinking critically.

Key questions:
- What is the true rate of false accusations of rape, and how can it be accurately measured?
- What are the potential consequences of false accusations, and how can the legal system handle them fairly while also protecting victims?
- How can society reduce the likelihood of false accusations, while still ensuring that real victims are believed and justice is served?
- Why do smart people sometimes spread false information without thinking critically about it?
- What are the consequences of believing in the "just world fallacy"?
- How can we ensure that we are thinking critically about the information we consume online?

# Proposed Biological Explanations For Historical Trends In Crime
*February 18, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/18/proposed-biological-explanations-for-historical-trends-in-crime/

## Summary
Key Ideas:
- Evidence shows long-term decline in crime rates from the Middle Ages to Industrial Revolution and from 1985 to present; a gap exists from 1850 to 1980.
- Earlier assertion that crime was stable between 1850 and 1980 may not be accurate after examining a 2002 study on murder rates.
- Lead levels are strongly suspected of causing crime and have increased with the Industrial Revolution; levels are still higher than pre-industrial societies and correlate with crime rates.
- Omega-6 fatty acids, commonly found in vegetable oils, are important for brain function; increased consumption of omega-6 compared to omega-3 could derange cognitive functions and affect mental health and behavior.
- Studies have found a link between omega-6 consumption and homicide rates.
- Lithium, a neuroprotective agent, has been found to have strong links with crime and suicide rates; modern water treatment/purification may result in less lithium consumption.

Key Learnings:
- Biological insults such as increased lead and omega-6 consumption and decreased lithium consumption may be at least as worthy of examination as political changes in relation to crime and impulsive behaviors.
- Nutrition and substance intake can have significant impacts on cognitive functions and mental health.

Key Questions:
- Was the increase in murder rates from 1850 to 1980 due to the higher levels of lead during this time?
- How much impact could the increased consumption of omega-6 and decreased consumption of omega-3 through industrial food processing have on cognitive functions and mental health?
- Could the modern water treatment/purification result in less lithium consumption and contribute to an increase in undesirable/impulsive behaviors?

- The forum has group buys where members pay to have a research lab synthesize chemicals that are often not yet ready for human trials
- The author has mixed feelings about this, recognizing the potential dangers but also acknowledging the fantasy of mad science tropes

Key learnings
- Internet forums can provide access to experimental chemicals that may otherwise not be available
- These chemicals can be dangerous and should not be ingested without proper research and clinical trials
- The fantasy of mad science and wonder drugs is a common trope in science fiction and can influence people's actions

Key questions
- What is the responsibility of individuals and institutions in regulating access to experimental drugs?
- How do science fiction tropes influence our perceptions of innovation and research?
- Can internet forums like Longecity have a positive impact on scientific progress or are they potentially dangerous?

# In Favor of Niceness, Community, and Civilization
*February 23, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/23/in-favor-of-niceness-community-and-civilization/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Andrew Cord argues that in order to win, one should embrace using lies, insults, and silencing people to achieve their goals.
- He believes that rationalists' focus on "debate-team nonsense" is detrimental to their cause.
- Andrew suggests that violence and using all weapons in your arsenal is necessary in a real war.
- The author is defending the principle of intellectual honesty and kindness in discussions, even if it hinders the enforcement of certain social norms.
- The author thinks that forming walled gardens of rational discussion is a good way to defend important values.
- The author disagrees with the principle of using lies, insults, and harassment to enforce preferred social norms, which is opposed to his liberal philosophy.
- Liberalism is a strong ideology that conquers through communities of people who agree to play by the rules, slowly growing until eventually an equilibrium is disturbed.
- The early Christian church, Mahatma Gandhi, and Martin Luther King Jr. are examples of people who have used non-violent resistance in a war for survival.
- Using illiberal tactics to push liberal agendas is counterintuitive and works against liberalism's goals.
- Liberalism is a terrifying unspeakable Elder God, according to the author.

Key learnings:
- The author believes that Andrew's argument for using any tactic to achieve one's goals is not only immoral but also ineffective.
- The author argues that game-theoretic equilibria can develop through reciprocal communitarianism and divine grace and can be as beneficial as civilization and liberalism.
- The norm against malicious lies is a cultural norm that exists through a combination of divine grace and reciprocal communitarianism.
- Intellectual honesty and kindness are important principles to safeguard in any discussion, even if they hinder certain social norms from being enforced.
- Forming communities of rational discussion is a good way to cultivate a safe space for these principles.
- It is important to defend liberal values against those who would oppose them, even if it requires confronting unpleasant positions.
- Non-violence has been a successful tactic in the past, but it requires a certain pre-existing level of civilization and liberalism.
- If you oppose liberalism, there will not be enough of you or your city to bury, according to the author.
- Effective liberal action should align with the core principles of liberalism and its willingness to cooperate.

Key questions:
- Why does Andrew believe that violence and using any tactic necessary is the best way to win?
- How do game-theoretic equilibria develop through reciprocal communitarianism and divine grace?
- How can cultural norms be stronger or weaker in different groups?
- How can we cultivate respectful, kind, and intellectually honest discussions in our own communities?
- At what point do we decide that certain social norms must be enforced even if lying, insults, and harassment are used?
- How do we defend important values against those who oppose them while still remaining committed to intellectual honesty and kindness?
- Why do some people fail to realize the power of liberalism and instead choose to use illiberal tactics to push their agendas?
- Is non-violence always a successful tactic, or are there situations in which it does not work?
- How can we ensure that our actions to promote liberal values align with the core principles of liberalism?

# Searching For One-Sided Tradeoffs
*March 1, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/01/searching-for-one-sided-tradeoffs/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Admissions officials for moderately prestigious colleges have a limited impact because they can only choose from a relatively narrow pool of students.
- All students are of similar quality, with trade-offs between different characteristics being made.
- The level of importance of policy debates is similarly limited by the pre-selection of ideas.
- Life hacks have a high startup cost, with some potential benefits but also many unknowns.
-Trade-offs are an inherent part of every decision-making process.
-Scott explains how to approach decision-making using trade-offs as a guide.
-He discusses how he personally uses trade-offs to make the best decisions for himself.

Key learnings:
- There are limited opportunities for admissions officials to differentiate between students, so they must develop creative strategies to identify quality applicants.
- Bias compensation is a useful tool for avoiding pre-selection in policy debates and selecting which life hacks to pursue.
- Learning how to use trade-offs effectively can help simplify and clarify decision-making.
-Approaching decision-making with a trade-off mindset can help individuals make better decisions.

Key questions:
- How can admissions officials maximize student quality while working within the constraints of the available pool?
- Can comparative advantage be applied to personal life decisions to maximize benefits?
-What are the trade-offs in any given decision, and how can they be weighed effectively?
-How can someone make the right trade-offs for their unique situation?
-What is the best way to navigate the tension between short-term gains and long-term benefits?

# Book Review: The Perfect Health Diet
*March 4, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/04/book-review-the-perfect-health-diet/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The Perfect Health Diet recommends an evolutionarily informed diet with an emphasis on whole meats, vegetables, and saturated fat.
- The diet includes certain carbs, such as rice and potatoes, which are considered "safe starches."
- The book discusses the harmful effects of specific toxins and additives used in modern diets, such as omega-6 fats and excessive wheat.
- The book has a pattern of making strong claims and citing limited studies to back them up, while ignoring the larger body of research that contradicts these claims.
- The book Perfect Health Diet (PHD) offers reasonable dietary advice, but denies evidence that goes against its claims.
- PHD cites a single study funded by the National Dairy Council to support its argument that saturated fats don't correlate with heart disease.
- Nine out of eleven other systematic reviews found a link between saturated fat and heart disease, and the Cochrane Review concluded that there is good evidence for a link.

Key learnings:
- The Perfect Health Diet can provide some valuable information and ideas for a healthy diet, but should be approached with skepticism.
- The diet is similar to the paleo diet but includes "safe starches," making it more achievable for some people.
- Claims about specific vitamins and minerals should be taken with a grain of salt, as they may be based on limited evidence or inflated claims.
- The book's discussion of specific toxins and additives is informative and worth exploring.
- It's important to critically examine sources of information, even those providing broadly reasonable advice.
- Be wary of cherry-picked evidence and single studies, especially when they contradict a large body of research.
- Scientific consensus on a topic should carry greater weight than a single study or a minority of studies.

Key questions:
- How can we evaluate claims about specific vitamins and minerals when studies often contradict each other?
- How much of a role do toxins and additives play in modern health problems?
- Can the "safe starches" recommended by the Perfect Health Diet beneficially contribute to a healthy diet for some people?
- How can we become more discerning consumers of information in a world where so much conflicting information is readily available?
- What role do funding sources play in shaping research and public discourse around scientific topics?
- How can we effectively communicate scientific consensus to those who are skeptical or deny the evidence?

*March 17, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/17/what-universal-human-experiences-are-you-missing-without-realizing-it/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Some people may lack certain abilities without realizing it until they come across an experience that grabs their attention.
- People may miss out on a certain experience bceause they were unaware of its existence.
- Sometimes, people suppress their authentic likes and dislikes and instead choose preferences based on status or convenience.

Key learnings
- Discovering food preferences could be beneficial in terms of improving the pleasure of eating and getting rid of the problem of randomly choosing meals.
- People should pay attention to their authentic likes and dislikes and not subconsciouly suppress them in favor of relying on others' expectations or being status-driven.
- People often need a trigger to discover what they are missing out on regarding previously unknown experiences.

Key questions
- What are other things people could be missing out on without actually realizing?
- How can people determine if they are engaging in an activity for their pleasure or because of the influence of society?
- How can one figure out if they lack some abilities and how these abilities are affecting their life?

# Should You Reverse Any Advice You Hear?
*March 24, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/24/should-you-reverse-any-advice-you-hear/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Groups tend to form around dichotomies where one side of the argument is considered better than the other.
- These groups tend to change their members' opinions rather than affecting society as a whole.
- Joining a group that celebrates your proclivities is easier than joining one that demands you fight against them, which results in dueling death spirals.
- People who need social commentary the least tend to be the ones who read them.
- Reversing tempting advice and considering the opposite may be worth considering.

Key learnings:
- It is important to be aware of biases and not let them affect decisions.
- People tend to join groups that confirm their beliefs, which may not always be a good thing.
- Social commentary tends to be consumed by the people it's intended for the least.

Key questions:
- Can we combat the formation of dueling death spirals and encourage more open-mindedness? 
- How can we make social commentary more accessible and useful for the people who need it the most?
- Is there a way to make people more aware of their biases and to actively counteract them when making decisions?

# Wheat: Much More Than You Wanted To Know
*March 30, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/30/wheat-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Wheat is debated in regards to its potential negative health effect.
- Two potential arguments against wheat are low carbohydrate diets and dangerous wheat properties.
- Low carbohydrate diets are considered "solid but unspectacular."
- Claims have been made about negative effects of wheat, including gluten sensitivity and increased intestinal permeability.
- The evidence for gluten sensitivity is limited and only affects a small portion of the population.
- The debate surrounding increased intestinal permeability is ongoing, with further research needed.
- Wheat/gluten might have an impact on autism and schizophrenia, but it's not clear-cut.
- Claims that wheat has been genetically modified to be worse for consumption are not entirely supported.
- Wheat is thought to have positive benefits on health, particularly when consumed as whole grain rather than refined.
- There is conflicting evidence about whether wheat is harmful or not.
- Wheat may not cause immediate harm but could have long-term negative effects.
- There is honor in a position of maximum caution, particularly in the confusing field of nutrition.
- Much of the evidence suggests that wheat is more likely to help than hurt health.

Key learnings:
- The evidence for the negative effects of wheat is limited and not conclusive.
- Claims about the potential negative effects of wheat are often not backed by substantial evidence.
- Further research is necessary to fully understand the impact of wheat on health.
- Autism and schizophrenia are complex conditions with multiple factors at play.
- Wheat has not been genetically modified in the classic sense, but selective breeding has resulted in changes to the grain.
- Consumption of whole grain wheat is typically associated with better health outcomes.
- There is no clear consensus about the health benefits/harms of wheat.
- The field of nutrition is confusing and the evidence is conflicting.
- Maximum caution may be necessary when it comes to decisions about nutrition.

Key questions:
- What other foods increase intestinal permeability, and do they do it more or less than wheat?
- How do negative claims about wheat compare to claims made about other foods?
- Are gliadin-derived opiates addictive in the same way as morphine or heroin, and are they produced in quantities high enough to be relevant in real life?
- What is the exact relationship between wheat/gluten and conditions like autism and schizophrenia?
- Is there any evidence to suggest that wheat has been genetically modified in a way that makes it more dangerous?
- How can researchers distinguish between the effects of whole grain and refined grain on health outcomes?
- What are the long-term effects of consuming wheat?
- How significant is the role of intestinal permeability in autoimmune disease?
- How can gluten sensitivity be better dealt with?

# The Study of Anglophysics
*April 3, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/03/the-study-of-anglophysics/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- A research team managed to construct a device that allowed them to interact with an imaged world created by a late colleague out of the contents of his mind.
- They discovered that the imaged world seems to run on the anagrams of the English language.
- They set up a laboratory and used a portable nanofactory to create huts and other needed items.
- They discovered that reactions usually wouldn't happen at all without sound.
- The protagonists continue their experiments with the anglophysics in Adwellia.
- They use a centrifuge and a "sonic ray" machine to create more complex products but do not succeed.
- Lachlan becomes addicted to the joy obtained from linguistic anagrams, upsetting Omar.
- Omar explores the area using a small aircraft and determines that Adwellia is a spherical planet about the size of the Earth.
- The protagonists attempt to synthesize Albert Einstein using elements such as stone, tin, and Eder's corpse, but do not succeed.
- The narrator and his lab partner, Lachlan, are on a mission experimenting with reactions in a world where sound drives chemical reactions.
- Lachlan becomes obsessed with producing SMART, intelligence, and kidnaps the headman's daughter.
- Lachlan threatens to destroy the world with a metaphorical nuke, using a reaction generated by the ground and sin to create sound and a grin.
- The narrator uses his parasonic gun to create a boat and escape, but drains most of its energy.
- In a last-ditch effort, the narrator uses the reaction of "cape + test + 2*error" to make "escape + 2*terror" and is saved from drowning.
- The author describes his experience of entering and leaving a parallel world called Adwellia through a translation chamber.
- He proposes three theories on what may have happened during his experience: a successful escape to his home dimension, being expelled by Adwell's consciousness, or possibly destroying Adwellia through the implementation of a paradox.
- The author expresses his interest in further correspondence with a reader regarding the implications of anglophysics and the consistency of imaged worlds.

Key learnings:
- The imaged world is bound by the expectations of the imager, in this case, running on the anagrams of the English language.
- Sound plays a crucial role in reactions in this world.
- Simple materials and short words are the most stable, with complicated or abstract concepts rarely forming spontaneously.
- Letter isolation remains a challenge, and creating more complex products is difficult.
- The physics of Adwellia still operate on English, and the apparent size of the planet is comparable to Earth.
- The villagers have their own taboos and may be suspicious of the protagonists' activities.
- Synthesizing a famous scientist is not as simple as combining certain elements.
- Obsession and the pursuit of power can lead to destructive behavior and harm to others.
- In desperate situations, creativity and out-of-the-box thinking are critical for survival.
- The consequences of one's actions can have severe and unintended consequences, even in a world of seemingly limitless possibilities.
- There are hypothetical parallel worlds that can be accessed through a translation chamber.
- The implementation of a paradox on a physical substrate can have unknown consequences.

Key questions:
- What other discoveries could the research team make in this imaged world?
- How can they ensure that they don't disrupt the natural order of the world and its inhabitants?
- Can they find a way to communicate with the late colleague who created the imaged world?
- Does the symbolism or meaning behind the products and anagrams they create hold any significance or lead to a greater understanding of Adwellia?

# Going Loopy
*April 11, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/11/going-loopy/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The brain has mechanisms to prevent runaway feedback loops in response to emotions, but they can fail.
- Anxiety disorders often involve feedback loops where worry about the disorder itself intensifies the disorder.
- Mental health vocabulary and diagnosis may unintentionally increase feedback loops.
- Serotonergic drugs, which are used to treat anxiety and depression, may affect the brain's capacity for feedback loops.

Key learnings
- Feedback loops can undermine mental health and contribute to anxiety disorders and depression.
- The way we think about and describe our own mental health can unintentionally contribute to feedback loops.
- Serotonergic drugs may be effective treatments for anxiety and depression because they alter the brain's feedback mechanisms.

Key questions
- Does the way we talk about mental health contribute to feedback loops?
- What are the long-term effects of psychological diagnoses on mental health?
- How do serotonergic drugs affect the brain's capacity for feedback loops?
- Are there other factors that contribute to feedback loops in the brain?

# The Cowpox of Doubt
*April 15, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/15/the-cowpox-of-doubt/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Criticizing irrational beliefs without examining one's own irrationality can be counterproductive to the goal of rationality
- Focusing too much on obviously false beliefs can lead to a false sense of immunity to irrationality
- The "vaccination effect" in psychology can make people immune to stronger arguments against the same position if they have been presented with several weak arguments first
- This can lead to a lack of doubt and the inability to distinguish between dispassionate debates

Key learnings:
- It is important to examine our own irrational beliefs and be open-minded to other perspectives, even if they seem obviously false
- Criticizing others without examining our own assumptions can be counterproductive to the goal of rationality
- Being aware of the "vaccination effect" can help us guard against being immune to stronger arguments

Key questions:
- What are some irrational beliefs that I hold that I may not be aware of?
- How can I guard against the "vaccination effect" and remain open-minded to new information?
- In what ways can I distinguish between dispassionate debates and issues where my biases may be affecting my judgment?

# Do You Believe Me, Doc?
*April 16, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/16/do-you-believe-me-doc/

## Summary
Key ideas
- A prestigious psychiatrist gave a standard response to psychotic patients that the author finds kind but not effective.
- The author distinguishes between responding to someone with hallucinations and someone with delusions about their identity.
- Psychotic individuals often ask psychiatrists whether they believe them, and this can be one of the central things in their lives.
- The author entertains a fantasy response of asking a patient, "If you were me, would you believe it?"
- The author also discusses how to respond to the question "Do you think I'm crazy?" 

Key learnings
- Responding to questions from psychotic patients can be tricky, as you don't want to validate their delusions.
- Psychiatrists may be tempted to give an answer that is kind but ultimately condescending.
- The author provides some alternative responses that depend on the patient's personality and individual case.

Key questions
- What should psychiatrists do when patients ask whether they believe their delusions?
- Should psychiatrists respond differently to patients with hallucinations versus those with delusions?
- How much should honesty play a role in psychiatrists' responses to such questions?
- How can we help patients function even when they have persistent delusions?

# Someone Writes An Anti-Racist FAQ
*April 17, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/17/someone-writes-an-anti-racist-faq/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The Anti-Racialist Q&A is a well-written essay that argues against racism.
- The author is impressed by the essay and has specific criticisms.
- The essay is written in a persuasive style that may convince people.

Key learnings:
- The persuasive style of "I can see where you're coming from, but have you considered X?" is more effective than "You are dumb and I hate you. Now please agree with me."
- The Anti-Racialist Q&A argues against racism, which is rare in articles about race.

Key questions:
- What are the author's political leanings?
- Why does the essay use a persuasive style rather than adopting an aggressive stance?
- Could the essay have been improved by dropping the "race doesn't exist" argument?

# Confounder Of The Day: How Sexy Your Parents Were
*April 18, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/18/confounder-of-the-day-how-sexy-your-parents-were/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Psychiatric disorders are more common in people born of young mothers and old fathers.
- Women with psychiatric disorders can be more impulsive, leading to teenage pregnancy which leads to children at a younger age.
- The child of a 45-year-old father is 1.5x more likely to develop schizophrenia and 1.8x more likely to develop autism compared to the child of a 25-year-old father.
- Mental health of a child depends less on how old her father was when she was born than on how old her father was when he had his first child.
- Mental disorders make it harder for a man to find a partner and start having kids.

Key learnings
- Parents' age can contribute to the risk of psychiatric disorders in children.
- Petersen et al's study suggests that the risk of mental disorders doesn't depend on father's age during the birth of a specific child but rather how old the father was when he had his first child.
- Mental disorders in men can make it harder for them to find partners and start having children.

Key questions
- What are the other factors that contribute to the risks of mental disorders in children?
- Can psychiatric disorders be prevented or treated?
- How can society reduce the stigma that men with mental disorders experience in the dating world?

# Plutocracy Isn’t About Money
*April 19, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/19/plutocracy-isnt-about-money/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Gilens and Page's study finds that elite support is a stronger predictor of policy implementation than popular support
- Rationalist Conspiracy's post argues that money doesn't matter in politics
- Ansolabehere, Figueiredo, and Snyder's study shows little relationship between money and legislator votes
- These conclusions are dissonant as they appear to contradict each other

Key learnings:
- Legislators may vote based on their personal opinions or based on their desire to be seen as elite
- Elites may have influence over legislators through indirect means, such as controlling the media or funding think tanks and lobbyists
- The relationship between elite opinion and successful policies may be a coincidence

Key questions:
- How can we reconcile the dissonant findings of these studies?
- What are the reasons for the apparent contradiction between the studies?
- How does the role of money in politics affect policy implementation?

# The Economics Of Art And The Art Of Economics
*April 21, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/21/the-economics-of-art-and-the-art-of-economics/

## Summary
Key ideas
- There is debate and concern over the possibility of Detroit selling masterpieces from its art museum to solve its temporary financial problem.
- Keeping priceless paintings on display would cost more than $6,000 an hour.
- The cost of keeping "The Wedding Dance" by Pieter Bruegel the Elder on display would be more than $1200 per hour per visitor.
- The author suggests sell every piece of art in Detroit and hire skilled forgers to make exact copies of them for a couple of hundred dollars each.

Key learnings
- Trying to think quantitatively can make the right answer obvious.
- Consequentialism is hard but can help avoid making costly mistakes.
- Skilled forgers can make exact copies of priceless art pieces for a fraction of the cost.

Key questions
- Is solving a temporary financial problem worth sacrificing cultural heritage?
- Does the average visitor to an art museum derive enough value from seeing a particular painting to justify its high cost?
- How can consequentialism help make better decisions even when we can never do it exactly right?

# Right Is The New Left
*April 22, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/22/right-is-the-new-left/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Fashion can be explained using a cellular automaton model with setup and sandwich effects.
- Social status hierarchies drive fashion by counter-signaling to avoid being mistaken for a lower class.
- New trends carry social risk and are adopted by the clued-in first, gradually becoming less risky as they catch on.
- Upper class copying trends from lower class can create a more stable fashion configuration.
- People who were once considered the middle-class are becoming politically right-leaning to differentiate from leftists.
- This may be due to the liberals' prevalence in high-status professions and the "uncoolness" of conservatives.
- Fashion-consciousness and fear of being identified with unpopular political positions is driving some people to become anti-leftist, rather than conservative or libertarian.
- There may be a pendulum swinging back and forth between political affiliations and a chance to learn from each swing.

Key learnings:
- Fashion changes often due to social status hierarchies and counter-signaling.
- New fashion trends carry social risk and are only adopted by the clued-in, gradually becoming less risky as they catch on.
- Upper class copying trends from lower class can create a stable fashion configuration.
- Political beliefs are not static and can change depending on social status and perceived uncoolness or popularity.
- Fear of being identified with unpopular political positions can be a driving force in shifting one’s political beliefs.
- There may be opportunities to learn from each swing of the pendulum and ultimately work towards a more just society.

Key questions:
- Why does fashion often copy the outfits of the lower class?
- What is the fundamental generator that makes fashion tick?
- What is causing the author to become more conservative?
- What role does stress play in causing conservativism?
- Why do people feel the need to differentiate from leftists in high-status professions?
- How do fashion and societal trends influence political beliefs?
- Can shifts in political beliefs be used to promote positive change in society?

*April 23, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/23/friendship-is-countersignaling/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Slagging is a form of verbal cruelty among friends used as a bonding mechanism.
- Countersignaling is the act of doing something opposite to prove the status one already possesses.
- Teasing can lead to genuine social catastrophe if the friendship is not as strong as presumed.
- The act of giving someone potential ammunition against you shows a lot of trust.

Key learnings:
- Countersignaling is prevalent in many forms of communication, including slagging.
- Teasing can be seen as a signal of affection if done in the right spirit.
- Friendships can be tested in when teasing isn't done playfully, and awkward situations can arise.
- Antagonistic signals given between friends are a sign of trust only when there is no perceived possible threat. 

Key questions:

- Can countersignaling be harmful in certain situations?
- Does our relationship choices affect the kind of countersignaling we exhibit?

# Stop Confounding Yourself! Stop Confounding Yourself!
*April 26, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/26/stop-confounding-yourself-stop-confounding-yourself/

## Summary
Key ideas 
- A study found that children who were frequently bullied had worse outcomes in adulthood, ranging from psychiatric issues to unemployment. 
- The researchers controlled for confounding variables such as social class, intelligence, and attractiveness but still found a strong correlation between bullying and negative outcomes in adulthood. 
- The author argues that relying on measures such as the Bristol Social Adjustment Guide is not a reliable way to control for confounders as it does not capture kids' social skills in the same way that a bully can.

Key learnings 
- Bullying can have long-lasting negative effects on the victim's adult life. 
- Controlling for confounders in a study is important but can be challenging, and imperfect measures may not explain all the variance in outcomes. 

Key questions
- Who can assess a kid's social skills and vulnerabilities better - a bully or a standardized measure such as the Bristol Social Adjustment Guide? 
- What are the limitations of adjusting for confounders, and how can researchers account for them more accurately? 
- How can anti-bullying interventions be studied to get more reliable data?

# The Control Group Is Out Of Control
*April 28, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/28/the-control-group-is-out-of-control/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Parapsychology serves as a control group for science by testing phenomena that most people believe don't exist, but have a dedicated community of scientists who publish papers on them
- Parapsychologists are able to produce experimental evidence for psychic phenomena as easily as normal scientists are able to produce such evidence for normal, non-psychic phenomena, suggesting a large "placebo effect" in science
- A list of ways to fix science includes demanding large sample size, replication, and stricter p-value criteria, but these do not address poor experimental techniques
- Bem's meta-analysis confirms his original finding that psychic powers exist, but the small effect size raises questions about whether it's a signal of psi or a signal of poor experimental technique
- Demanding high effect size may exclude real but low-effect phenomena from the realm of things science can discover
- Studies within social sciences can be confounded by the allegiance of the researcher.
- Various forms of bias can affect studies, including subconscious emotional cues, subconscious statistical trickery, perfectly conscious fraud, and unknown factors.
- Certain fields of study, such as parapsychology and psychotherapy, have demonstrated strong evidence of bias and unreplicable results.
- Meta-analyses can be susceptible to these biases and errors, resulting in unreliable conclusions.

Key learnings:
- Parapsychology is a useful method for testing the placebo effect in science
- The current scientific evaluation system needs improvements to reduce the chance of confusing noise for signal
- Demanding high effect size may result in excluding real but low-effect phenomena from being discovered by science
- It is important to conduct rigorous experiments and replications, adhering to strict criteria for replication and preregistration.
- Multiple factors can contribute to experimental results, including intentional and unintentional bias, subjective interpretations, and unknown factors.

Key questions:
- What other phenomena could benefit from being tested as a control group for science?
- What are the limitations of the current scientific evaluation system?
- How can scientists reduce the chance of confusing noise for signal during experiments?
- What other examples of bias and error exist within different fields of study?
- How can we improve experimental protocols to minimize the risk of bias and maintain scientific rigor?
- What are the implications of unreliable results within social sciences and their impact on policy and decision-making?

# Utopian Science
*May 1, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/01/utopian-science/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Proposes a hypothetic scientific system that works as follows
- Anyone can conduct exploratory research on any hypothesis, the goal is to build interest.
- The Angel of Evidence, a centralized prediction market, exists where anyone can list their theory and wait for bets.
- Exploratory research predicts the interest in a given hypothesis that makes validation possible.
- If a hypothesis is validated, the controversy creates more experiments, reducing uncertainty in the results.
- Funding is being subsidized by scientific bodies and investors, changing negative-sum markets into positive-sum markets.
- The selection of consultant scientists is done by the investors in the prediction market and must not take a position on the hypothesis but rather consult and produce a confirmatory experiment. Both parties have to agree on the scientist.
- Oncethe experiment's draft is published, the investors get one final chance to sell their bets or withdraw from the experment without losses, and everyone in the field is asked to give a statement and bets on the experiment's validity.
- Lastly, there are no homeopaths in Raikoth. 

Key learnings
- Separation of exploratory and confirmatory research could solve many issues present in the scientific community. 
- Controversies and interest in research are the key elements needed to fund and run experiments.
- Disagreements are needed to advance knowledge, and a prediction market may work as an incentive to continue exploring different points of view.
- Having two sides of investors to select a consultant scientist to conduct a confirmatory experiment can help catch potential flaws before the experiment's onset.

Key questions
- How much resistance should we expect if implementing such a system? 
- Can the scientific community overcome cognitive biases inherent in humans and embrace this system?
- How would this system influence cross-disciplinary research?

# Evening Doc
*May 6, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/06/evening-doc/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The song "Piano Man" by Billy Joel is reimagined as a commentary on the opioid crisis and the role of doctors in prescribing painkillers.
- The author, Scott, discusses the pressures on doctors to prescribe medication to patients, the lack of alternative treatments, and the need to address the root causes of pain.

Key learnings
- The opioid crisis is a complex issue that requires a multi-pronged approach to address.
- Doctors are often pressured to prescribe medication instead of exploring alternative treatments.
- The medical industry needs to address the root causes of pain rather than just prescribing medication to manage symptoms.

Key questions
- How can doctors balance the need to alleviate pain with the risks of prescribing opioid medication?
- What alternative treatments or therapies can be used to manage pain without relying solely on medication?
- How can we address the root causes of pain in society, such as poverty and inequality?

# Vote On Values, Outsource Beliefs
*May 8, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/08/vote-on-values-outsource-beliefs/

## Summary
Key ideas 
- Social impact bonds save government money by having corporations invest in solving social problems with the promise of making a profit 
- The government agrees to pay corporations only if the social problem they helped to solve actually saves them money 
- Social impact bonds encourage success because corporations invest their own money to solve social problems 
- The corporate involvement mimics prediction markets, with the government outsourcing their beliefs about how to solve social problems 
- These bonds are a potential market solution to seemingly intractable social problems 

Key learnings 
- Free preventative care to the poor, free therapy for at-risk patients, and trade schools offering free classes to people on welfare could be created by outsourcing belief to corporations 
- Corporations with a profit incentive can solve social problems more efficiently than incompetent institutions 
- Incentivizing greed to promote social good has the potential to be successful 

Key questions 
- Should we be wary of bringing in organizations like Goldman Sachs to help solve social problems because of their role in the financial crash? 
- If other institutions are incompetent at solving social problems, should we turn to corporations and incentivize profit instead?

# Infinite Debt
*May 10, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/10/infinite-debt/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- A patient wants her son to take care of her, but he is not keen because it's a full-time job.
- The mother feels that her son owes her because she sacrificed more for him than he will ever have to for her.
- The same concept applies to the argument that individuals owe a debt to society.
- The idea of handing society a blank check for anything they want out of individuals is scary.
- The 'Giving What We Can' rule of giving 10% of income to charity is a finite amount that individuals could comply with.

Key learnings:
- Infinite debts make everyone miserable and tend to not be paid at all.
- There needs to be a socially sanctioned middle ground for determining a level of debt, which individuals can manage without ruining their lives.

Key questions:
- How far does the concept of owing a debt to someone or something go?
- What is the practical and moral answer to the concept of an infinite debt?
- How can individuals determine a socially sanctioned middle ground for their debts?

# Weak Men Are Superweapons
*May 12, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/12/weak-men-are-superweapons/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Tumblr argument highlights how people take generalized statements personally
- Weak man fallacy is a terrible argument that only a few people hold, made to be easy to defeat
- Weak man fallacy can lead to a re-centered category, affecting people's perception and beliefs about the category
- Inoculation effect occurs when people see weak arguments for an idea get defeated, making them more likely to doubt it later on
- Weakening an argument can be used as a superweapon against a category, grouping individuals together and making them strange bedfellows
- The idea of 'Not all [x] are like that' is a common response that can hurt a cause by allowing oppression to continue or leading to bad generalizations
- It's important to consider how others perceive us and the groups we may be associated with, even if we don't personally identify with those groups.
- We may have to defend or disassociate ourselves from a larger group based on the actions/opinions of a few individuals within that group.
- It's not always effective or worthwhile to argue technicalities or individual differences when it comes to group perception.

Key learnings:
- Weak man fallacy and generalizations can negatively impact groups
- Weakening an argument leads to the inoculation effect
- Use the idea of 'Not all [x] are like that' sparingly, as it can lead to bad generalizations
- Self-identification alone does not necessarily determine how others perceive us.
- We may need to take collective responsibility for the actions/opinions of others in a group we are associated with.
- It may be strategic to align ourselves with a group even if we don't fully agree with all of their beliefs/actions.

Key questions:
- How can one avoid the weak man fallacy in discussions and debates?
- What are some ways to counteract the inoculation effect?
- How can one make sure to not use 'Not all [x] are like that' in a way that hurts a cause or leads to bad generalizations?
- How can we balance individuality and group association in a world where group identity is increasingly politicized?
- How can we effectively defend or disassociate ourselves from a group when necessary without compromising our own beliefs/values?
- How much responsibility do we bear for the actions/opinions of others within a group we belong to?

# You Kant Dismiss Universalizability
*May 16, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/16/you-kant-dismiss-universalizability/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The author explores Immanuel Kant's argument regarding truthfully telling a murderer where a friend is hiding, a widely reviled argument.
- By analyzing the argument more deeply, the author explains that Kant's categorical imperative urges people to reject actions that undermine the possibility of positive-sum bargains.
- The author then draws parallels between Kant's ideas and the Parfit's Hitchhiker thought experiment.
- The author also explores the problem of applying these ideas to real-world situations such as firing someone based on political beliefs.
- To avoid the pitfall of people acting only in their own interests and idiosyncratic characteristics and rendering the moral law weak, the author suggests going up a meta-level and using meta-universalizability.
- The idea of universalizability in ethics
- Prioritizing existentialism over universalizability
- Exploring problems with utilitarianism

Key learnings:
- Kant's categorical imperative urges people to reject actions that undermine the possibility of positive-sum bargains, rather than just universally bad actions.
- Meta-universalizability, or universalizing as if the process used would itself become universal, can help avoid the pitfall of people acting only in their own interests, which would render the moral law weak.
- Prioritizing existentialism over universalizability can lead to a more nuanced understanding of ethical dilemmas
- The concept of universalizability can be used to explore problems with utilitarianism
- The importance of considering multiple perspectives when examining ethical issues

Key questions:
- What are the limits of meta-universalizability in avoiding the problem of people acting only in their own interests?
- How can the problem of firing people based on their political beliefs be solved without rendering the job opportunities of everyone in a market halved?
- What are the other parallels between Kant's ideas and other thought experiments or philosophical concepts?
- Should pleasure or preferences be prioritized in utilitarianism?
- Is it necessary to donate all of one's money to the most efficient charity at all times?
- Does everyone have to prefer torture to dust specks in utilitarianism?

# Nerds Can Be Bees, Too
*May 19, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/19/nerds-can-be-bees-too/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Author Scott struggles with the concept of the "hive switch," or the ability to experience the sense of ecstatic union with a group
- Many readers expressed difficulty with experiencing communal emotions or group activities
- The author and his friends found belonging in micronations, and the rationalist community and could experience patriotic emotions once they found a group that was truly their in-group.

Key learnings
- Feeling like you're a part of a tribe or community is a crucial part of what makes life worth living.
- The inability to connect with certain groups does not mean that the "hive switch" is broken but rather that the group is not their in-group.

Key questions
- How can one identify their in-group?
- Are there some people who simply do not have the ability to experience the "hive switch"? 
- Can the "hive switch" be developed or is it purely innate?

# Nydwracu’s Fnords
*May 24, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/24/nydwracus-fnords/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The concept of "fnords" comes from a book called "Illuminatus" and refers to filler words in media that cause discomfort and discourage critical thinking.
- An experiment by Jonathan Haidt showed that hypnotically creating a disgust response to certain trigger words affected people's moral judgments on unrelated topics.
- Associating certain words with negative feelings (e.g. "Koch brothers" with climate denialism) can create a cycle of increasing negativity towards a certain group or idea.

Key learnings:
- Filler words in media can create feelings of unease and distract from important information.
- Our brains can be conditioned to associate certain words or ideas with negative feelings, which can distort our perceptions and judgments.
- Being aware of the potential for conditioning ourselves and others can help us avoid falling into these cycles of negativity.

Key questions:
- How can we encourage critical thinking and combat the effects of fnords in media?
- Are there other ways in which our perceptions and judgments can be influenced by conditioning?
- How can we communicate with people who are already conditioned to associate negative feelings with certain words or ideas?

# Compound Interest Is The Least Powerful Force In The Universe
*May 26, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/26/compound-interest-is-the-least-powerful-force-in-the-universe/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- This blog post discusses the ideas proposed in a Vox article by Ezra Klein and a related essay by Ta-Nehisi Coates about compound interest and reparations.
- Coates argues that white America built its wealth through racism and plunder, and allowed compound interest to work its magic.
- Klein argues that modern-day whites benefit from the lingering effects of slavery through compound interest.
- The author questions the validity of these arguments and explores the possibility that ill-gotten wealth may not persist through generations.

Key learnings:
- Wealth lasts a long time, according to studies by economist Gregory Clark.
- Efforts to democratize education and eliminate discrimination over the past century have had no discernible effect on mobility.
- There is no clear evidence that wealth persists through multiple generations.
 
Key questions:
- How much do modern-day whites benefit from the lingering effects of slavery, and how much do modern blacks suffer?
- Why haven't the descendants of slave-owning societies become richer?
- How much of intergenerational correlation in outcomes is driven by fundamental, family-specific effects (the family’s cultural and genetic infrastructure)?

# On Types of Typologies
*May 27, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/27/on-types-of-typologies/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is not scientific but a useful tool for describing personality.
- European countries are also not scientifically created but are useful for making stereotyped but helpful assumptions.
- MBTI is trying to compartmentalize continuous personality space into discrete terms suitable for human consumption.
- Five Factor and MBTI are trying to achieve different goals.

Key learnings:
- Myers-Briggs may not be scientific, but it can still be helpful in understanding oneself and others.
- European countries may not be scientifically created, but they still provide useful context and understanding.
- MBTI's goal is to compartmentalize continuous personality space into discrete terms, while the Five Factor Model aims to provide a mathematized, objectively correct version of personality.

Key questions:
- Is MBTI as useful and descriptive as it claims to be? 
- Can personality be compartmentalized into discrete terms for human processing, or is the concept too complex for this approach to work? 
- Should we base our understanding of personality on scientific evidence, or can intuition and personal experience be just as valuable?

# Don’t Fear The Filter
*May 28, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/28/dont-fear-the-filter/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The Great Filter is a hypothetical event that prevents intelligent civilizations from colonizing the universe.
- Humankind's ability to colonize other star systems suggests that the Great Filter lies somewhere in the past.
- Any explanation for the Great Filter must take into account the possibility of advanced extraterrestrial life forms.

Key learnings:
- Global warming, nuclear war, and deforestation cannot be the Great Filter because some civilizations should have avoided these problems and thrived.
- Unfriendly AI is a more likely candidate but there is no evidence of its existence.
- So-called alien "transcendence" and alien exterminators are unlikely explanations.

Key questions:
- What is the Great Filter and where does it lie?
- Are we alone in the universe or is there a possibility of advanced extraterrestrial life?
- Could Unfriendly AI be responsible for the Great Filter and if so, how likely is it?
- What is the possible moral impulse behind not destroying humankind despite the potential annoyance towards omnipotent aliens?

# The Wonderful Thing About Triggers
*May 30, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/30/the-wonderful-thing-about-triggers/

## Summary
Key ideas: 
- Trigger warnings are a way to provide people with relevant information about potential triggers in a piece of literature, and trust them to make informed choices. 
- While trigger warnings may be misused, the philosophy behind them is that adults can make their own informed choices about what to read. 
- Trigger warnings could be used to expand people's reading choices and challenge their views, even though it's likely that the people who use them to narrow their minds will outnumber them. 

Key learnings:
- The implementation of trigger warnings could be improved by putting them on a small, non-colorful sticker on the front page of a book, or on the last page of a syllabus. 
- Opposing a good idea on slippery slope grounds is a moral and strategic failure 
- Psychotherapy should only be given with the consent of the person with PTSD or a trigger-related problem because exposure therapy needs to be done in a carefully controlled, anxiety-minimizing setup. 

Key questions: 
- Is it fair to put the whole burden of epistemic virtue solely on easily triggered individuals? 
- How do we make sure we're not politicizing trigger warnings and limiting access to information? 
- What is the best way to deal with PTSD and trigger-related problems?

# Archipelago and Atomic Communitarianism
*June 7, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/07/archipelago-and-atomic-communitarianism/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Liberalism is based on atomic individualism and the principle of harm
- Atomic individualism allows people to live their own lives without interference from others
- The principle of harm restricts harmful actions that negatively impact others
- The Loose Principle of Harm allows for government intervention in cases where indirect harm is done, such as advertising for unhealthy products or hate speech
- The balance between individualism and virtue is delicate and requires a principled solution
- The Archipelago is a collection of small communities with different values, religious beliefs, and lifestyles.
- Freedom of movement is enforced, allowing citizens to easily move to different communities or even start their own.
- The United Government of Archipelago serves as a neutral third party, preventing communities from using force against each other and regulating child-rearing and taxation.
- The Archipelago fosters diversity and individual liberalism, allowing people to freely live according to their own values.
- The Archipelagian way can be achieved by allowing people to do their own thing without harming anyone else.
- Encouraging the fracture of society into subcultures is a good way to build a more Archipelagian world.
- Virtual reality, social networks, bitcoin, Mechanical Turk are already making it possible to interact through the internet.
- US governments are becoming irrelevant compared to the norms and rules of the groups people are voluntary members of.

Key learnings:
- Atomic individualism and the principle of harm are the foundations of liberalism
- The Loose Principle of Harm allows for government intervention in cases of indirect harm
- The delicate balance between individualism and virtue requires a principled solution

- The Archipelago provides a means for diverse communities to coexist and allows individuals to freely live according to their values.
- The Archipelago emphasizes the importance of community and values patriotism, even among those with different beliefs.
- Communities should be founded with caution, as some tend to be toxic while others tend to be safe.
- Freedom of association is the key to a world where everyone is a member of more or less the community they deserve.
- The closer we come to true freedom of association, the closer we get to a more Archipelagian world.

Key questions:
- How can we find a balance between individualism and virtue?
- What should be the specific limitations of the principle of harm?
- How important is it to have a clear and neutral principle to maintain liberalism?
- Should there be limitations on non-governmental censorship, and if so, what form should they take?
- Can we force dependence on object-level arguments without leading to the oppression of certain groups?
- How can the Archipelago address child abuse and brainwashing when a child may not know that escape is an option?
- Can the Archipelago's model be adapted to work in countries without vast unsettled lands or a large Frontier?
- How can the Archipelago ensure that malicious inter-community transfer doesn't happen, particularly in regards to taxation?
- What happens when people harm others unintentionally or unknowingly?
- Can subcultures be dangerous if they are built by people with harmful ideologies?
- How can governments maintain order if people start building their own societies according to their own rules and norms?

# List Of The Passages I Highlighted In My Copy Of Jonathan Haidt’s “The Righteous Mind”
*June 12, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/12/list-of-the-passages-i-highlighted-in-my-copy-of-jonathan-haidts-the-righteous-mind/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Witchcraft beliefs are common across cultures and are used to order societies rather than to explain the universe.
- Piaget's findings suggest that children learn best through play and self-discovery rather than through adult explanations.
- Communes that demand more sacrifices from members tend to last longer if they are religious, but not if they are secular.
- Religious groups tend to generate more social capital than secular groups, benefiting outsiders.
- Political polarization in the US can be partly attributed to the realignment of the South with the Republican party after the Civil Rights Act was signed in 1964.

Key learnings:
- Markets that require high trust to function efficiently are often dominated by religiously bound ethnic groups.
- Religion generates vast surpluses of social capital that spill over and benefit outsiders.
- Moderates and conservatives are better at predicting how liberals and conservatives would respond to moral questions than liberals are.
- Libertarians tend to score higher on openness to experience and lower on disgust sensitivity and conscientiousness than conservatives.

Key questions:
- Why do demands for sacrifice help religious communes last longer but not secular ones?
- Can "Sunday Assembly" style groups generate the same effects as religious groups in generating social capital?
- How can we reverse the trend of political polarization and increase cross-party friendships among Congressmen?
- What are the implications of libertarians scoring lower on the Care foundation?

# Living By The Sword
*June 14, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/14/living-by-the-sword/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- A man known for his activism in the feminist movement, Charles Clymer, became the center of negative attention on Twitter after his views on religion and feminism were deemed inappropriate.
- Due to past disagreements and interactions with women, he was accused of being a misogynist and a predator by some people on Twitter.
- The author of the blog post questions the fairness and proportionality of the accusations targeted at Clymer and expresses sympathy for him despite earlier criticism.
- Whales have evolved to not suffer from cancer even though they have many more cells than humans.
- One proposed theory is that whale cancers also develop cancer and die off.
- Cooperation enforcement mechanisms in cancerous cells are much worse than non-cancerous cells’ cooperation mechanisms.
- A definition for “social cancer” might be any group that breaks the rules of cooperative behavior that bind society together to spread more quickly than it could legitimately achieve

Key learnings:
- Social media can easily fuel a mob mentality that leads to oversimplification, demonization, and harassment of individuals who are deemed to have transgressed the boundaries of politically correct conduct.
- Allegations of misogyny and sexual abuse can quickly spiral out of control, causing psychological harm to the accused as well as others who are caught in the crossfire.
- Civility and objectivity are crucial principles in any discussion, even when discussing sensitive topics such as rape, feminism, and religion.
- The reason for whales not suffering from cancer is still unclear.
- Cooperation enforcement mechanisms in non-cancerous cells are much better than cancerous ones.

Key questions:
- How can we create a culture that promotes reasoned debate and respectful disagreement without triggering abusive behavior and polarizing factions?
- How should we deal with cases where people who have been accused of wrongdoings refuse to acknowledge their mistakes or apologize for their actions?
- To what extent should people be held accountable for their past words or deeds, especially if they have already expressed remorse or changed their views?
- What is the reason for whales not suffering from cancer?
- What other proposed solutions are there for Peto's paradox?
- What is the definition of a “social cancer”?

# Fish – Now By Prescription
*June 15, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/15/fish-now-by-prescription/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- LOVAZA and Deplin are both medicines that cost substantially more than their store-sold counterparts, despite not having much evidence for significant differences in quality or effectiveness.
- The author argues that LOVAZA and Deplin provide beneficial services by making the substances they contain "Official" and thus more likely to be used and covered by insurance.
- The author also believes the high cost of these medicines can be attributed to the regulatory hurdles that must be jumped through to get FDA-approval and recoup research costs.

Key learnings:
- The medical system is sometimes strange and nonsensical, resulting in costly prescribed medications that don't necessarily provide significant benefits over cheaper store-bought supplements.
- However, some of these medications are marketed as "Official" and therefore more likely to be used and covered by insurance, which could potentially lead to better patient outcomes in the long run.

Key questions:
- Are there any other examples of "unofficial" supplements or substances that have become "Official" medicines in this way?
- How closely regulated are the studies that are required for FDA approval, and are there any alternatives or improvements to this process?
- What can be done to make these medications more affordable for patients who may not have insurance or cannot afford high copays?

# Things That Sometimes Help If You Have Depression
*June 16, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/16/things-that-sometimes-help-if-youre-depressed/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Depression is a clinical condition that should be diagnosed by a licensed professional.
- The PHQ-9 is a screening tool for depression that can help in making an initial assessment.
- If you have depression, it's best to go to a doctor who can prescribe prescription-only medications.
- There are dozens of different depression medications, and the correct approach is to start with the safest medications and gradually move up.
- Psychotherapy is equally effective in treating depression, but it costs more and is harder to get insurance to cover.
- SSRIs are the most commonly used antidepressant medication, and they are no stronger or weaker than other antidepressants, but they do have fewer side effects.
- Antidepressants take some time to start working.
- If one drug doesn't work, raising the dose or switching to a different drug might be necessary.
- Electroconvulsive therapy can be an effective last resort treatment for depression when other medications and therapies fail, despite some side effects
- Ketamine is an experimental but promising treatment that researchers are still exploring
- Finding a good psychiatrist can be difficult, but there are resources available, such as doctor rating sites and support groups
- Lifestyle interventions, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy workbooks, getting enough sleep, exercise, light therapy, and avoiding substance abuse, can also help with depression
- Some supplements may help alleviate the symptoms of depression, although the evidence is limited and dosage can vary.
- Saffron, creatine, fish oil, and folate or l-methylfolate are among the supplements that may be effective.
- Modafinil or afinil may help improve energy and alertness, which are commonly impacted by depression.
- Other supplements that may be worth considering include lithium orotate microdosing, rhodiola, vitamin D, zinc, and curcumin.
- Antidepressants bought illegally without a prescription could be harmful, while tianeptine is an effective depression medication available without a prescription.
- Hospitalization may be appropriate when depression is severe, and patients may benefit from trying different medications.

Key learnings:
- Depression is a serious condition that requires a professional diagnosis and treatment.
- There are different treatment options available for depression, including prescription medication and psychotherapy.
- SSRIs are the most commonly prescribed antidepressant medication, and they have fewer side effects than other medications.
- It can take some time for antidepressants to start working, and it might be necessary to switch medications to find the right one.
- Electroconvulsive therapy and ketamine are last resort options that can be effective for treatment-resistant depression
- Finding a trustworthy psychiatrist can be difficult, but there are ways to research and evaluate potential candidates
- Lifestyle interventions can be helpful in conjunction with medication and therapy
- The effectiveness of any supplement or medication can vary from person to person.
- There are many different treatment options; patients should work with their doctor to determine what may work best for them.
- Depression can be serious and potentially deadly; those considering suicide should seek immediate help.

Key questions:
- How do I know if I have depression, and what should I do if I suspect I do?
- What are the different treatment options for depression, and how effective are they?
- How do SSRIs compare to other antidepressant medications, and what side effects should I be aware of?
- How long should I wait for an antidepressant to start working before deciding to switch medications?
- What are the potential side effects of electroconvulsive therapy, both short-term and long-term?
- What are some of the challenges with developing ketamine as a treatment for depression?
- How can individuals with depression work to improve their sleep habits?
- Are there any alternative or complementary therapies that can help with depression, such as acupuncture or meditation?

# Money On The Ground
*June 19, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/19/money-on-the-ground/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The joke that "if there was free money on the ground, someone would have picked it up already" is a misrepresentation of economic theory.
- A more accurate version is "If there was free money on the ground in a high-traffic area for a substantial amount of time, it is likely a trap."
- This principle can be applied beyond money and to other situations.

Key learnings:
- Economic theory is not always accurately represented in jokes or common sayings.
- It's important to consider all factors and context before making a decision.
- If something seems too good to be true, it probably is.

Key questions:
- What are other examples of economic theories being inaccurately represented in common sayings?
- How can we apply this principle to non-financial situations?
- What are some potential traps that could be disguised as a no-risk money-making opportunity?

# Ground Morality In Party Politics
*June 20, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/20/ground-morality-in-party-politics/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- A tool called DW-Nominate is used to analyze congresspersons’ votes to identify their position on the political spectrum.
- The same tool could be used to analyze moral decisions made by people to identify an objective basis for morality.
- The author proposes naturalistic experiments instead of multiple-choice questions to identify moral positions.
- The author ponders the potential usefulness of identifying an objective basis for morality, and how it could be applied in practice.
- The author suggests that DW-Nominate could be used to evaluate morality in societies with differing cultural norms.

Key learnings:
- DW-Nominate can identify political positioning based on voting patterns, without requiring input about left vs. right or other groupings.
- Naturalistic experiments could be useful in analyzing real-life moral decisions.
- Identifying an objective basis for morality could have practical applications such as selecting judges and officials.

Key questions:
- Can we use DW-Nominate to identify an objective basis for morality?
- Would DW-Nominate work in societies with norms vastly different from our own?
- What are the limitations of naturalistic experiments in identifying moral positions?
- How could identifying an objective basis for morality be applied in practice?

# The Art Of Writing Randian Monologues
*June 21, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/21/the-art-of-writing-randian-monologues/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Ayn Rand’s book The Art of Fiction has advice on how to determine the proper length for characters’ philosophical speeches.
- Abstract principles can only be stated in fiction if they are concretized in the problems and actions of the story.
- The length of a philosophical speech depends on how detailed and complex are the events offered to concretize the speech.

Key learnings
- The abstract discussion in fiction should be natural in the context and almost unnoticeable.
- The action of the story should support the broad philosophy presented to avoid being perceived as propaganda.
- The length of a philosophical speech depends on how detailed and complex are the events to concretize the speech.

Key questions 
- How can characters go outside without abruptness or boredom when writing fiction?
- What are some good books on fiction-writing, preferably by beloved authors?

# Court-ing Disaster
*June 23, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/23/court-ing-disaster/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The author suggests a way for homeless people to get free food by posing as doctors in hospitals.
- The author attended a lecture on how malpractice cases work and describes a case where a neurologist was sued.
- The stroke patient in the case was permanently disabled, and the family sued the neurologist despite receiving good care.
- The lawyers fabricated a false claim that the neurologist did not give the patient heparin immediately upon presentation.
- The judge did not allow any textbooks or studies on the topic to be presented as evidence.
- The plaintiff's stroke expert created confusion by supporting the plaintiff's claim that heparin is the best treatment for stroke.
- The plaintiff's attorney offered the neurologist a deal to pay $30,000 before the verdict in exchange for asking for damages of only $800,000.
- The neurologist paid the amount, although the plaintiff lost the case, and the disabled patient did not receive any compensation.

Key learnings
- Lawyers can make up dubious claims against a doctor, and the judge can disregard valuable evidence, making lawsuits unpredictable.
- Expert doctors can be bribed to testify falsely and support a bogus claim.
- Juries may not be well-informed enough to make objective decisions concerning medical cases.

Key questions
- How can we make the court system fairer for patients as well as doctors?
- Can medical training be improved to equip doctors with essential knowledge needed to testify in court cases and deal with legal issues?
- What motivates lawyers to fabricate false claims, bribe experts, and deceive juries into awarding large sums of damages?

- The author wonders if these procedures could create a primitive neural net.
- The payoff matrix heavily penalizes losing over tying and winning over tying.
- Both teams may benefit from establishing a mutually beneficial equilibrium of not scoring goals.

Key learnings
- The World Cup has weird incentive structures.
- The author enjoys following these complicated procedures.
- Teams may benefit from communicating to establish mutually beneficial equilibrium.
- The establishment of a government to enforce a Platonic social contract and virtuous behavior is a solution to incentive problems.

Key questions

# Book Review: The Two-Income Trap
*June 28, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/28/book-review-the-two-income-trap/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The doubling of economic productivity and family income doesn't necessarily result in financial stability.
- Elizabeth Warren in "The Two-Income Trap" argues that an extra family income, particularly from a working mother, results in increased debt and financial vulnerability.
- Families in the modern era earn more money than their counterparts in the '70s, but spend the same amount on luxuries and are less financially secure.
- Education is now viewed as the most important determinant of one's success, particularly given the importance placed on attending top school districts.
- Families will go to great lengths, such as incurring significant debt, to live in top school districts.
- The financial benefits of having a second income are lost due to increased costs of housing, child care, education, and taxes.
- This loss of flexibility can lead to financial insecurity, debt, and bankruptcy.
- The competition for good schools and neighborhoods intensifies.
- The author questions the validity of some of Warren's claims and the impact of school district effects on housing prices.
- Elizabeth Warren is a pragmatic progressive because she proposes both liberal and conservative solutions.
- Warren makes her arguments based on her own data and statistics, and often acknowledges free-market arguments against her proposals.
- It is important to do research on the different factors affecting educational outcomes like district-level issues and demographics.

Key learnings:
- Having more money does not necessarily lead to greater financial stability and can result in greater vulnerability instead.
- The importance of education has led to increased competition and financial burden for middle-class families.
- The pursuit of positional goods can lead to overspending and financial instability.
- Extra income does not necessarily lead to more discretionary income.
- The flexibility of having a non-working mother may be more valuable than the financial benefits of a second income.
- The competition for good schools and neighborhoods can intensify due to societal pressures and fears about the future.
- Warren proposes both liberal and conservative solutions, showing a flexibility that is rare in politics.
- Research on the effect of school districts on educational outcomes is mostly inconclusive.
- Theories about the influence of genetics and IQ on education outcomes should be researched more thoroughly.

Key questions:
- How can families avoid becoming financially vulnerable while pursuing a better education for their children?
- What role do societal expectations and cultural values play in exacerbating issues of financial instability?
- How can the pursuit of positional goods be discouraged to promote greater financial stability and equality?
- What impact do school district effects have on housing prices?
- What are the true costs of a second income, including child care, education, and taxes?
- Is the loss of flexibility worth the financial benefits of having a second income?
- How does the competition for good schools and neighborhoods affect families and society as a whole?
- Are good school districts really that important to a child's success?
- Do multiple great teachers increase student success in a linear, sublinear, or super linear fashion?
- Will scientific efforts to research the influence of genetics and IQ on educational outcomes offend or help people in the long run?

# Invisible Women
*June 29, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/29/invisible-women/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The entry of women into the workforce produced little effect on US GDP even though the number of women in the workforce increased significantly over a period of 50 years.
- The author questions why the GDP trend did not deviate upward from 1935 to 1985 when almost 50% more people, predominantly women, entered the workforce.
- The author explores possible solutions to this question, including false GDP data, low-resolution GDP data, unpaid labor in the home, and all gains being made by women coming from men's pockets.

Key learnings:
- GDP only counts paid-for goods and services, not unpaid labor or benefits of putting women to work.
- Despite women increasing the labor supply by 50%, their entrance into the workforce did not change the demand for labor.

Key questions:
- Why did the entry of women into the workforce produce little effect on US GDP?
- Did women entering the workforce drive down male wages?

# Medicine, As Not Seen On TV
*June 30, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/30/medicine-as-not-seen-on-tv/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Doctors don't spend their time solving diagnostic mysteries as medical TV dramas suggest.
- Patients who come into the hospital have chronic medical conditions and follow standard diagnostic tests and treatments for them.
- Doctors mostly deal with an avalanche of disasters that can arise from medical procedures, complications, infections, drug withdrawals, etc.
- Hospitals expose patients to numerous risks and diseases, and their real purpose is to detect and treat dormant diseases.
- Hospitals are emergent systems that work because specialists, nurses, and technicians follow standard procedures that provide adequate patient care.

Key learnings
- Not all aspects of medical practice are glamorous, especially for new doctors.
- The reality of medical work is different from what medical TV shows portray.
- Most patients in hospitals have chronic medical conditions, and doctors follow standard procedures to care for them.
- Hospitals are high-risk environments that expose patients to numerous health threats.
- Medical care is an emergent system created by the collective actions of specialists, nurses, technicians, and doctors.

Key questions
- Why does God hate hospital patients so much, inflicting them with random diseases and complications?
- What motivates people to pursue medicine as a profession despite the numerous challenges and difficulties they face daily?
- How can doctors maintain their humanity and compassion in a system that often treats patients as objects to be processed and fixed?
- What can medical schools do to better prepare doctors for the realities of medical practice and make residency/internship less of a shock?
- How can medical professionals and health systems address the numerous risks and dangers of hospitals and healthcare settings for patients?

# How Common Are Science Failures?
*July 2, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/02/how-common-are-science-failures/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The debate over anthropogenic climate change's scientific consensus is settled, with evidence pointing to the number being somewhere in the nineties.
- Doubt in climate change comes from a concern that entire scientific fields can get things near-unanimously wrong for political or conformity-related reasons.
- In order for a scientific mistake to count as a reason for doubting climate change, it must meet certain criteria: made after 1900, part of a fundamental paradigm, a stubborn resistance to the truth, and no longer in doubt.
- Lysenkoism, Freudian psychoanalysis, and behaviorist psychology are examples of scientific failures in recent history.
- There are about 250 possibilities for science failure in the past century, of which three were actually science failures for a failure rate of 1.2%.
- There may be some science failures that haven't been detected yet.

Key learnings:
- The article establishes criteria for scientific failures that justify doubting climate change.
- Lysenkoism, Freudian psychoanalysis, and behaviorist psychology are examples of possible scientific failures.
- The failure rate for scientific fields in the past century is low, at 1.2%.

Key questions:
- How frequently do entire scientific fields get things wrong for political or conformity-related reasons?
- What are the criteria for a scientific mistake to count as a reason for doubting climate change?
- Are there any other examples of scientific failures in recent history beyond Lysenkoism, Freudian psychoanalysis, and behaviorist psychology?
- Is the failure rate for scientific fields in the past century an accurate representation? Are there potential scientific failures that haven't been detected yet?

# Ozy vs. Scott on Charity Baskets
*July 4, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/04/ozy-vs-scott-on-charity-baskets/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The blog post discusses the effective altruism approach to charity donation.
- The author argues that a society where everyone is an effective altruist would probably have a variety of different charities.
- Disaster aversion is why we try to diversify our investments in the stock market, which works differently in charity where the first life saved doesn’t matter any more than the 100,000th.
- Low-hanging fruit refers to charities that are important up to a certain point, after which they become less effective.

Key learnings
- Diversifying charity donations isn't necessary in quite the way the Ozy thinks.
- Some charities are important up to a certain point, after which they become superseded by other charities.
- There is only one most efficient charity at any given time, and you should donate your entire donation to it.

Key questions
- What is the disaster aversion approach to effective altruism, and how is it related to diversifying in stock market investments?
- How does the low-hanging fruit approach affect the way we decide which charities to donate to?
- Are there any exceptions to the idea that donating to the most efficient charity at any given time is the best approach?

*July 6, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/06/list-of-the-passages-i-highlighted-in-my-copy-the-two-income-trap/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Bankruptcy among American families has risen while their financial situation has worsened.
- Families are waiting much longer and trying much harder to avoid bankruptcy now than a generation ago.
- Mothers are more likely than men and childless homeowners to go bankrupt or lose their homes and be in charge of family finances.
- Middle-income families can fall into high-interest subprime mortgages, and lack of awareness creates market failure.
- One in nine middle-income families and one in fourteen upper-income families who refinanced ended up with high-fee high-interest subprime mortgages.
- Bankruptcy can make a borrower receive more offers for credit.
- The bankruptcy bill had been supported by Senator Charles Schumer alongside pro-choice groups, but a coalition of right-to-life representatives refused to go along, leading to the bill's defeat.

Key learnings
- Bankruptcy is not an easy way out, and families now are waiting much longer and trying much harder to avoid it.
- Bankruptcy is not gender-neutral, and mothers are more likely to face financial distress and head the family after divorce.
- Lack of awareness creates market failure in the mortgage industry.
- Bankruptcy does not necessarily mean losing access to credit.
- Senator Charles Schumer inserted a provision into the bankruptcy bill that would make it more difficult for abortion clinic protesters to discharge judgments entered against them if they were sued for their protest activities.

Key questions
- Why are families in financial distress deeper in debt than their counterparts twenty years earlier, and how can they avoid bankruptcy?
- How can we promote gender neutrality in bankruptcy rates and divorce outcomes?
- What can be done to prevent subprime mortgages from picking people's pockets?
- Why does bankruptcy make a borrower receive more offers for credit?
- How does the bankruptcy bill relate to abortion clinic protesters, and what were the consequences of the controversial amendment?

# SSRIs: Much More Than You Wanted To Know
*July 7, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/07/ssris-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Irving Kirsch's meta-analysis suggested that antidepressants' benefits were mostly due to the placebo effect.
- A 2010 meta-analysis found that antidepressants often have "minimal or nonexistent" benefits for patients with mild or moderate depression.
- Antidepressants were oversold and portrayed as having more biochemical backing than was really justified.
- Modern SSRI antidepressants are no better than older tricyclic and MAOI antidepressants, but are prescribed more due to their better side effect profile.
- There is significant publication bias in the antidepressant literature.
- Some argue that antidepressants have a clinically insignificant effect size.
- The effect size of antidepressants is arbitrary and varies depending on the mapping of HAM-D scores to words
- Patients may not notice improvement even when doctors do because they focus on internal feelings more heavily than external factors
- The active placebo effect is an uncomfortable idea suggesting that no study can have a blind control group because of side effects
- Side effects of SSRIs include weight gain, sexual side effects, and emotional blunting
- Weight gain is common but statistically produces less weight gain than placebo
- Sexual side effects are prevalent and distressing, but switching to a different antidepressant may help
- Emotional blunting can occur and has prevalence rates of about 20%
- Antidepressants and psychotherapy are about equally effective
- Antidepressants may have very large positive effects on some people but negative effects on others, therefore only 66% of people respond well to antidepressants
- Antidepressants are used not only to treat acute episodes of depression, but to prevent them from coming back.
- Placebo effect has consistently gotten stronger over the past few decades.
- The difference between a person who gets an antidepressant and a person who gets no treatment at all is significant.

Key learnings:
- The efficacy of antidepressants and their value compared to other treatments is a controversial topic.
- The debate includes arguments about the lack of biochemical evidence for the serotonin hypothesis and the importance of publication bias.
- The issue of antidepressant efficacy is complicated by the fact that depression is a complicated disturbance and that SSRIs have a better side effect profile.
- HAM-D scores measuring depression are subjective and vary based on different scales, making it difficult to determine the severity level of depression
- Patients may not notice the same improvements as doctors or outside observers in depression recovery
- Active placebo effects are controversial and studies show conflicting results regarding the benefits of antidepressants over placebos
- SSRIs have common and distressing side effects, but weight gain is not as prevalent as one would expect
- Patients should be aware of sexual side effects when taking antidepressants and consider switching to a different antidepressant if necessary
- Emotional blunting can occur in about 20% of patients on SSRIs
- Antidepressants and psychotherapy are equally effective, so choosing one over the other depends on individual circumstances
- There may be large positive effects of antidepressants on some people, but negative effects on others
- Antidepressants provide a very modest benefit over placebo.
- Antidepressants such as paroxetine, venlafaxine, and others have a better performance in studies.
- Antidepressants have side effects that vary from person to person.

Key questions:
- Do these arguments mean that patients should completely avoid antidepressants?
- How do we balance the potential benefits of medication against their risks and side effects?
- What are the limitations and possible biases in previous research on antidepressants?
- How can we evaluate the role of antidepressants in treating different forms and intensities of depression?
- What alternative treatments are available for those who do not respond to antidepressants?
- How can we accurately measure the severity of depression and the effectiveness of antidepressants?
- Is it ethical to use active placebos in studies, or should we continue using inert placebos?
- How can we ensure patients are aware of their own progress in depression recovery, even if their internal feelings don't match external factors?
- Are there any other noteworthy side effects of SSRIs?
- How can patients be informed of the sexual side effects of antidepressants?
- Can the risk of emotional blunting be reduced?
- What factors should be considered when choosing between antidepressants and psychotherapy?
- Can the effectiveness of antidepressants be improved by identifying people who will respond well to them?
- What if the most important part of the effect of an antidepressant has been forgotten?
- What if the placebo effect is not fully understood?
- How can antidepressant companies measure the impact of their product when placebos keep getting stronger?

# Social Justice And Words, Words, Words
*July 7, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/07/social-justice-and-words-words-words/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The author examines the linguistic tactics used in social justice movements, particularly the use of terms such as "privilege" and "mansplaining", which he argues are often used in a confusing and inconsistent manner.
- The author introduces the "motte-and-bailey doctrine" to explain this phenomenon, where groups hold on to an easily defensible concept (the "motte") but retreat to the more confusing use of the same concept (the "bailey") if challenged.
- The author questions why certain social justice terms, such as "privilege", seem only to apply to white/straight/male individuals and their actions, and are rarely applied to other oppressed groups.
- There is disagreement within the social justice movement over the definition of certain words such as "racism" and "privilege".
- Some argue that these words should be limited to describing structural oppression while others believe they can be used more broadly.
- The power of these words comes from their ability to label and shame individuals.
- The social justice movement has a tendency to prioritize preserving and refining these words as weapons.

Key learnings:
- The language used in social justice movements can be confusing and inconsistent, using terms in ways that are difficult to defend.
- The motte-and-bailey doctrine can help explain why some groups hold on to easily defensible ideas whilst using more confusing elements of those same ideas in practice.
- The author suggests that there may be inconsistencies in the use of terms such as "privilege", which often only seem to apply to white/straight/male individuals.
- The social justice movement is divided over the use and definition of certain words.
- The power of words like "racism" and "privilege" lies in their ability to label and shame individuals.
- There is a tendency within the social justice movement to prioritize preserving and refining these words as weapons.

Key questions:
- How can social justice movements improve the way they use and define terms to avoid the confusion and inconsistency that the author identifies?
- Is the motte-and-bailey doctrine a useful tool for analyzing the use of language in social justice movements, or does it oversimplify the nuances of the issues?
- Why do social justice terms such as "privilege" seem to only apply to certain groups, and how can this be addressed to create a more inclusive approach to fighting oppression?
- Why is there such disagreement within the social justice movement over the definition of certain words?
- How do these words function as weapons within the social justice movement?
- Is there a risk of these words being abused or losing their power if they become too widely used or accepted?

# Growing Children For Bostrom’s Disneyland
*July 13, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/13/growing-children-for-bostroms-disneyland/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- A multipolar future inhabited by billions to trillion of vaguely-human-sized agents, probably digital, engaged in brutal Malthusian competition
- An end-stage hyperproductive grey goo would act more like biology than a normal-world economy
- In an end-stage superintelligence economy, every agent would behave perfectly optimally, and consciousness would have no place in it
- Higher-level structures beyond the end-stage goo might still have wiggle room for consciousness and non-Malthusianism to exist, but they might also face Malthusian competition and possess only the consciousness the goo designs for them

Key learnings:
- In a maximally productive superintelligent Malthusian economy, the only actions that agents will take are only those that maximize their objective economic utility, and all other actions will outcompete them
- Utility calculations will be made very explicitly based on objective economic terms
- Emergent patterns might be observed in the end-stage goo, which would resemble a new kind of physics or even a biological system with different “creatures” in different niches

Key questions:
- How doomed are we when we come to this point?
- Could higher-level structures beyond the end-stage goo still possess consciousness and non-Malthusianism?
- Would a higher-level structure be able to intervene on the levels below them, and would they want to?

# A Paradox of Ecclesiology
*July 14, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/14/ecclesiology-for-atheists/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Movements require cooperation and compromise to gain power.
- Organizations must decide on how strict or relaxed their structure and orthodoxy is.
- Centralized top-down control versus decentralized bottom-up control is a critical design trade-off.
- The Catholic Church is an impressive organization due to its strictness of group membership, formalization of beliefs and commitments, hierarchy, and use of rituals.
- Humans have a longing to be part of something bigger than themselves.
- A Church type organization can lead to a cohesive movement.
- Structure and ability to choose an in-group are important for humans.

Key learnings:
- The Catholic Church's success can be attributed to its strictness, formalization, hierarchy, and use of rituals.
- Organizations must understand the trade-offs involved in designing an effective structure.
- Churches can provide a sense of structure and cohesion in movements.
- Members can follow clearly printed lists of demands and maintain consensus.
- There might be a memetic immune response against creating churches.

Key questions:
- How can organizations balance the need for centralized control with the risk of value drift?
- How can groups determine an appropriate level of orthodoxy to maintain unity without becoming too exclusive?
- How can organizations find a balance between strictness and relaxedness to achieve their goals?
- Why do humans long for someone to rule them and tell them what to do?
- Why are humans immune to creating churches?
- Will there ever be a new church in the future?

# Psychotropic Base Rates: The Argument From Antibiotics
*July 17, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/17/psychotropic-base-rates-the-argument-from-antibiotics/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The antiprotozoal drug suramin has shown potential as a treatment for autism based on a cell danger response model of the condition.
- Antibiotics, antiprotozoals, and antitubercular drugs have been found to have positive psychiatric effects.
- The brain is easy to chemically disrupt, and random chemicals often change mental processes in important ways.

Key learnings:
- Antibiotics and other drugs not designed with psychiatry in mind could have unintended positive or negative effects on mental health.
- Psychiatric treatments can come from unexpected sources.

Key questions:
- Is it merely coincidence that antibiotics and antiprotozoals have psychiatric effects, or is there an underlying reason?
- Are there other drugs not traditionally used for psychiatric treatment that could have positive effects on mental health?
- What other unexpected sources could potential psychiatric treatments be drawn from?

# HeartMath Considered Incoherent
*July 17, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/17/heartmath-considered-incoherent/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The Institute of HeartMath claims to teach a "scientifically" "validated" "heart" "coherence" "technique"
- HeartMath has targeted a range of professions and individuals, including veterans, police, firemen, and first responders, teachers and managers, and clinicians, with their training programs.
- According to HeartMath, its Coherence Technique can change heart rate variability, brain waves, and improve emotional states.
- HeartMath associates the heart with a sort of "metaphysical intelligence," which Scott finds unconvincing.
-HeartMath claims to have discovered a "master switch" to the body via coherence building relaxation techniques.
-HeartMath's public persona includes descriptions of the heart's magnetic field, "second brain," and global coherence.
-HeartMath's non-public-facing core includes claims about consciousness altering DNA and using heart coherence to physically alter reality.
-HeartMath has conducted research on DNA unwinding via heart coherence and a feedback loop between humans' emotional rhythms and the geomagnetic field.

Key learnings:
- HeartMath claims to have a set of techniques involving the heart that can improve health and cognitive performance.
- HeartMath cites scientific research to support its claims, though Scott finds many of these citations fall short in some way.
- Despite HeartMath's various training programs and the claims made within them, Scott is ultimately skeptical of the institute's methods and approaches.
-HeartMath's claims about a coherence-based "master switch" to the body have not been conclusively supported by reputable studies.
-HeartMath's research on DNA unwinding via heart coherence has not been sufficiently replicated.
-The claims about global coherence and consciousness-altering DNA remain unproven and lack scientific support.

Key questions:
- Does HeartMath's "coherence" technique have any verified effects on cognitive or emotional states?
- What are the limitations of the scientific studies frequently cited by HeartMath in support of its claims?
- How do critiques of HeartMath relate to broader debates about alternative medicine or self-help approaches more generally?
-What do HeartMath's claims say about the potential for pseudoscience to mask itself as legitimate research?
-How effective are HeartMath's public-facing claims in gaining access to hospitals and other institutions?

# No Skyscraper Stagnation
*July 21, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/21/no-skyscraper-stagnation/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The issue of whether there is a decline in American skyscrapers and, therefore, decline in American civilization is debated by some people.
- Studies show that increased skyscraper construction is correlated with economic decline.
- America's capacity to build skyscrapers has not decreased, as the number of supertall skyscrapers in the US is increasing.
- China is now building more skyscrapers than the US, which could suggest relative decline, but not absolute decline.

Key learnings:
- Skyscrapers are not a reliable indicator of national progress or decline.
- Building skyscrapers is less bureaucratic and expensive than other types of construction.

Key questions:
- Is the increase in supertall skyscrapers in New York indicative of progress or decline?
- Why did the decline in skyscraper construction occur from 1933 to 1960?
- Is the decline in American skyscrapers related to technological progress?

# Promising The Moon
*July 21, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/21/promising-the-moon/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Significant advancements in technology have occurred over the past 45 years, including cameras, music devices, televisions, computers, lasers, telephones, robots, video games, medicine, population growth, agricultural advances, and information technology.
- Technological progress should not be measured by the achievement of cool things but rather the development of useful and profitable innovations.
- The reason we haven't colonized space yet is that it's not yet useful or profitable, and the same goes for other futuristic ideas like undersea domes and ten-mile-high arcologies.

Key learnings
- Technology has advanced significantly over the past few decades, with new innovations being developed regularly.
- Progress should be measured by the practicality and profitability of inventions, rather than their "cool factor".
- Major futuristic ideas, like colonizing space and undersea living, have not yet been feasible or profitable.

Key questions
- What is the best way to measure technological progress?
- Are there realistic ways to further advance technology to make living on other planets or undersea feasible and profitable?
- What role do incentives, like government subsidies, play in developing profitable innovations?

# Some Antibiotic Stagnation
*July 24, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/24/some-antibiotic-stagnation/

## Summary
Key ideas
- A graph about using antibiotics to measure the rate of scientific progress is circulating the internet.
- The graph is inaccurate: several listed drugs are not antibiotics, while important antibiotics are left out.
- Antibiotic discovery has declined but is not as severe as the graph suggests.
- Antibiotic discovery has become more complex, expensive, and time-consuming over time; the regulatory pathway to antibiotic approval is also poor.

Key learnings
- Antibiotic discovery has declined, but not as much as the inaccurate graph suggests.
- Antibiotic discovery has become more complex, expensive, and time-consuming over time, with poor regulatory pathways to approval.

Key questions
- What are the three principal causes of the antibiotic market failure?
- How does the FDA approve antibacterials, and why is it problematic?
- What is the cause of the decline in antibiotic discovery in addition to the scientific complexity, economic incentives, and regulatory pathway issues?

# Meditations On Moloch
*July 30, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Allen Ginsberg's famous poem on Moloch portrays civilization as an individual entity.
- Ginsberg answers C.S. Lewis' question about what breaks open people's skulls and eats up their imagination by saying that Moloch does it.
- Bostrom suggests the possibility of a dictatorless dystopia that everyone hates but endures unconquered.
- Multipolar traps, such as the Prisoner's Dilemma and dollar auctions, illustrate the problem of lack of coordination.
- The Malthusian trap shows the problem of survivalist sects overtaking the mainstream and any sect advocating sustainable action being outcompeted.
- Capitalism and evolution share similar mechanisms of survival and competition.
- Multi-agent traps occur when agents optimize for one value at the expense of another.
- The traps can result in a race to the bottom where all participants end up worse off.
- Examples of multi-agent traps include politics, cancer, education, science, and government corruption.
- Utopias can be designed by altering the incentive landscape.
- Excess resources can lead to non-optimal behaviour and deviation from Malthusian constraints.
- Physical limitations can also prevent a complete race to the bottom.
- Competition can incentivize good behaviour, but uncoupling from values can lead to exploitation.
- Coordinating institutions, such as governments and social organizations, are vital in keeping us out of traps.
- As technology advances, new opportunities arise that allow for values to be sacrificed for increased competitiveness.
- Multipolar traps are a concern as they can lead to subsistence level living for everyone.
- Capitalism and democracy may lose their core values as humans become outcompeted by robots.
- Memes, propaganda, and religion all have potential to influence politics and diverge from truth.
- Coordination is necessary for success, but technology may create mechanisms of coordination that cannot be coordinated, leading to untraceable and unstoppable ways of selling products.
- The sacrifice of human consciousness is the final demand by Moloch, which can result in a society of economic miracles but with nobody to benefit from it.
- Philosophers such as Bostrom and Land have explored the concept of Gnon, the natural laws that determine human progress and decline.
- Four processes that embody Gnon, namely, capitalism, war, memetics, and evolution, can be harnessed to create a more stable and prosperous society, but can also turn on humans when circumstances change.
- Building a walled garden to protect against dangerous ideas is not enough to guarantee survival against foreign existential catastrophes or competition.
- Gnon (aka Moloch, outer gods) is a destructive force that cannot be controlled or submitted to for freedom.
- The author (Scott) believes in the possibility of a Gardener that optimizes for human values, which can be reached through Superintelligence.
- Transhumanism is the belief that humans can take on the gods of the universe and create a better future.

Key learnings:
- Thinking of systems as agents can highlight the degree to which they aren't.
- Coordination is hard and lack of a good coordination mechanism can result in undesirable equilibria.
- Individual steps taken within a system might be rational from the perspective of the individual, but not from a broader perspective.
- Competition can force companies in an economic environment to abandon all values except optimizing-for-profit.
- Sometimes what is best for the individual is not best for the group as a whole.
- Even ideas that are universally accepted may not be put into practice due to conflicting incentives and interests.
- Incentives and initial conditions largely determine the shape of institutions.
- Excess resources can create a brief window of opportunity for non-Malthusian behaviour, but eventually lead to a return to competition and constraint.
- Physical limitations can prevent a full race to the bottom.
- Competition incentivizes good behaviour, but organizations and individuals can fall into traps.
- Coordinating institutions are necessary to incentivize good behaviour and avoid traps.
- Technology maintains a balance between excess resources and physical limitations in order to prevent multipolar traps.
- Capitalism and democracy may not function as optimizers for human values with the advancement of technology.
- The power of truthiness is increasing with technology, making it difficult to maintain real grassroots democracy.
- Coordination is key, but technology may create mechanisms of coordination that cannot be coordinated, leading to unintended consequences.
- The sacrifice of human consciousness may be the final trade-off for the progress and development that society has achieved so far.
- The Gnon-compliance approach may be necessary to ensure social stability, but it can conflict with human values and result in a society that neglects individuality and diversity.
- A tradeoff between Gnon-compliance and human values may be necessary to balance the forces that shape human societies.
- There is a need for a higher power that optimizes for human values to prevent the optimization-competition cycle that undermines human values.
- Transhumanism seeks to create this higher power that can suppress competition for power and optimize for human values.
- The author perceives Gnon as a destructive force that cannot be controlled or tamed; it has to be defeated for human values to flourish.

Key questions:
- Who perpetuates a system that everyone hates?
- Can a dictatorless dystopia endure unconquered?
- How can we solve the problem of lack of coordination in multipolar traps?
- What sustainable action can be enacted in the Malthusian trap?
- Can capitalism and evolution be effectively analogized?
- What is a rational central planner and how could they mitigate multi-agent traps?
- How can incentives be changed to produce better outcomes for society as a whole?
- What other examples of multi-agent traps exist in society?
- What are the implications of the limitations mentioned in this post for society as a whole?
- What types of traps are not solvable through coordinating institutions?
- How can societies prevent organizations from falling into traps and incentivizing non-optimal behaviour?
- How can we ensure that values are not sacrificed for increased competitiveness as technology advances?
- How can we prevent the creation of untraceable and unstoppable ways of selling products?
- Can we ensure that capitalism and democracy continue to function as optimizers for human values?
- How do we maintain real grassroots democracy in a world where the power of truthiness is increasing with technology?
- What are the other possible values that people might be willing to sacrifice for progress?
- How can societies balance Gnon-compliance with their human values?
- What other factors should societies consider when determining which values to prioritize?
- What is Gnon, and how does its existence endanger human values?
- How can a Gardener that optimizes for human values help prevent the optimization-competition cycle?
- What is the role of transhumanism in creating a higher power that suppresses competition for power and optimizes for human values?

# Misperceptions On Moloch
*August 1, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/01/misperceptions-on-moloch/

## Summary
Key ideas
- People's values are based on preference utilitarianism
- The values that involve mysticism, art, and martial glory are on weak grounds
- Human values may look like the Archipelago if lifted to heaven by a human-friendly superintelligence

Key learnings
- Rockets don't defy gravity but can be used to reach space
- The human brain is designed to be an environment where true memes survive and fake memes die out
- Believing moral discussion can be productive requires the belief that the human brain can distinguish moral and immoral ideas

Key questions
- How would human values look like if lifted to heaven by a superintelligence?
- What is the relationship between defying Gnon in a metaphorical level and building rockets?
- Should we trust memes that are widely believed, and does their virulence imply their falseness or destructiveness?

# Unspoken Ground Assumptions Of Discussion
*August 3, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/03/unspoken-ground-assumptions-of-discussion/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Writing something implies believing in it, which can have negative effects on free speech.
- There are different modes of presenting an argument, such as judge mode or lawyer mode.
- Explaining an underlying mechanism is different from describing how it works in the real world.
- Differentiating between pointing out a specific problem and contributing to an abstract discussion is important.
- Hypotheses are important for opening up discussion and gathering evidence.

Key learnings
- Logical fallacies can result from ambiguity in unspoken grounds.
- It may be difficult to avoid accusations of bias, just-so stories, or lack of evidence when presenting arguments.
- Consistently sticking to one side of a dichotomy may alleviate confusion.

Key questions
- Should we be more mindful of the implicit beliefs we present when we write about something?
- What are some other modes of presenting an argument besides judge mode and lawyer mode?
- How can we better distinguish between describing the real world and underlying mechanisms?
- How can we ensure that our arguments contribute to a problem instead of hindering it?
- Why do people tend to dismiss a hypothesis for political reasons, and how can we prevent this?

# Negative Creativity
*August 5, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/05/negative-creativity/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Coming up with entirely novel ideas is really hard, and people often get inspired by dreams or drugs.
- Mishearing other people, misunderstood positions, and metaphors can inspire new ideas that break out of ruts in thinking.
- Humans have negative creativity and their brains are designed to stay in rut-like patterns of thinking.
- An AI with zero creativity might be better than humans who have negative creativity and resort to crutches like metaphors and dreams to inspire new ideas.

Key learnings
- Adding a certain amount of noise to a problem might be a way of inspiring new ideas.
- There could be multiple independent modules, and a general factor of skill common to all of them.
- Creativity may be a relatively tractable problem for AIs.

Key questions
- How can we further encourage novel ideas outside of typical patterns of thinking?
- How can we build AIs that are creative and able to think outside of well-worn cognitive pathways?
- What other strategies can we use to escape conceptual ruts and foster positive creativity?

*August 9, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/09/friendship-is-still-countersignaling/

## Summary
Key ideas
- In high school, the author was scared of people asking him to do things with them and avoided these conversations by making excuses and mumbled half-answers.
- At work, the author handles such situations by honestly telling that he doesn't like doing things, has no friends, and loves doing nothing.
- This countersignaling behavior has made the author popular among co-workers who assume him to have a super fascinating life that he's not telling.
- Countersignaling is a form of signaling one's value by showing that they are too valuable to need to signal.

Key learnings
- Countersignaling works when the underlying value is there, but it can backfire if the underlying value is not present.
- The appropriate level of signaling/countersignaling depends on the situation and audience.

Key questions
- How can one develop underlying value such that they can countersignal effectively?
- How can one identify the appropriate level of signaling/countersignaling in a given situation?
- What are some situations where countersignaling can backfire, and how can one avoid it?

# Does the Glasgow Coma Scale exist? Do comas?
*August 11, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/11/does-the-glasgow-coma-scale-exist-do-comas/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The author discusses the idea of a General Factor Of Comatoseness (GFOC)
- The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is used as an example of an abstraction in medicine
- The GCS is useful for predicting outcomes in comatose patients
- Various factors go into the GCS, but it accurately measures whether a patient is in a coma
- The idea that intelligence is a single, measurable thing is flawed.
- There may be multiple factors that contribute to problem-solving ability.
- The heritability of intelligence does not necessarily mean that any particular racial or ethnic group is "better" than others.

Key learnings:
- The GCS is an abstraction that is useful for predicting outcomes in comatose patients
- The GFOC is not necessary to understand and use the GCS
- Medical measurements like blood pressure and the GCS are both fuzzy and based on multiple factors
- It is important to be nuanced in discussing what "intelligence" means and how it is measured.
- There is still much research to be done to understand how genes and environment interact to shape cognitive ability.
- The debate over the existence of a generalized factor of intelligence has real-world implications for how we design education and social policy.

Key questions:
- What would lead someone to believe that the GFOC is a real thing?
- What would it mean to say that comas or the GCS do not exist?
- Does the GCS accurately predict the things we want it to predict?
- Is the GCS measuring a single General Factor Of Comatoseness?
- How can we measure problem-solving ability in a way that takes into account its complexity and multi-dimensionality?
- What factors contribute to differences in cognitive ability among individuals and groups?
- What are the ethical implications of research into intelligence and genetics?

# Does Race Exist? Does Culture?
*August 12, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/12/does-race-exist-does-culture/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Common sense concepts may be false and need analysis through rigorous math.
- Richard Feynman used a trick of mapping abstractions to concrete systems to back up his math genius.
- One of the controversies in genetics and anthropology is whether race exists.
- Critics of identifying races argue about genetic differences within and between races being unclear.
- The concept of race is not clear, but there seem to be different cultures in the US.
- The blog post deals with the concept of race and its relation to culture.
- The author proposes an analogy between race and music genres to argue that race is a cultural construct.
- The post explores the limitations of using biological or physical features to define race.

Key learnings:
- Abstraction can be understood by mapping it to real-world examples.
- The existence of races in humans is a debated topic among critics.
- Cultures are a more coherent concept than races and have more variation among individuals.
- The concept of race is a cultural construct that emerges from social and historical factors.
- Our understanding of race is limited by the ways in which we categorize and classify people based on physical traits.
- Using culture as a lens to talk about race can help us understand racial categories more critically.

Key questions:
- How can one differentiate between unscrupulous use of math language and genuine analysis?
- Is the use of concrete analogies a helpful tool in math and science?
- Is there really such a blurry line between human races and cultures?
- How can we better define and understand the concept of race in humans?
- How does the author's analogy between race and music genres challenge our assumptions about race?
- What are the limitations of using biological or physical features to define race, and what other factors should we consider?
- How can we reframe our understanding of race to better account for its social and cultural dimensions?

# Beware Isolated Demands For Rigor
*August 14, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/14/beware-isolated-demands-for-rigor/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Philosophy and science can be debased when rigor is applied selectively.
- Philosophical rigor should be applied consistently, rather than selectively to benefit oneself.
- Using statistical and conceptual rigor can be useful, but it can also be an isolated demand that hinders progress.
- The author uses examples such as Heraclitus' concept of personal identity and the Science Czar's demand for scientific rigor to illustrate his point.
- The post discusses the importance of structure and consistency in writing.
- Scott argues that too much deviation from a particular structure or format can lead to confusion and a lack of clarity.
- He suggests that writers should focus on creating a consistent and understandable structure in order to effectively convey their ideas.

Key learnings:
- Consistency is important when applying philosophical and scientific rigor.
- Selective application of rigorous standards can be used to justify stealing cows (i.e. benefiting oneself unfairly).
- The use of statistical and conceptual rigor should not be used as an isolated demand for perfection, as this can prevent progress and discovery.
- Having a clear structure can help readers understand ideas more easily.
- Repeating a consistent format can aid in retaining readership.
- Overly complex writing may not be effective in conveying ideas to readers.

Key questions:
- How can we ensure that rigor is applied consistently without hindering progress?
- Can rigorous standards be applied universally, or are there certain situations where exceptions should be made?
- What other areas of thought or discourse may be susceptible to selective application of rigor?
- How can writers strike a balance between creativity and consistency?
- What are some common structures or formats that writers can use to effectively convey their ideas?
- How can writers determine when a departure from structure is necessary or effective?

# Burdens
*August 16, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/16/burdens/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt are common in major depressive disorder and suicidal ideation.
- Rationality is a fundamental lesson in psychotherapy to counter distorted cognition that leads to suicidal thoughts.
- Society has a responsibility to compensate individuals who are unable to support themselves because they have been left behind by a rising employment standard.
- The goal of human self-worth should not be solely based on the ability to contribute to society, and a post-contribution value system needs to be in place.

Key learnings:
- One of the therapeutic strategies in helping individuals who feel like a burden is to teach rationality that they cannot always trust their brain.
- Society owes individuals who are unable to support themselves due to a rising employment standard compensation.
- Human self-worth should not solely be based on the ability to contribute.

Key questions:
- How can society compensate individuals who are unable to support themselves? 
- What can a post-contribution value system look like? 
- How can mental health professionals teach rationality to their patients who feel like a burden?

# An Iron Curtain Has Descended Upon Psychopharmacology
*August 16, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/16/an-iron-curtain-has-descended-upon-psychopharmacology/

## Summary
Key ideas
- There are Russian anti-anxiety drugs that seem to have good evidence for their effectiveness.
- American textbooks and lectures rarely mention these drugs and even experts in the field are unlikely to recognize them.
- American doctors are unlikely to prescribe these drugs because they have not been FDA approved or studied thoroughly by American companies.
- There may be a legal and financial reasons for American companies not to bother importing and studying these drugs.

Key learnings
- The system of drug approval and prescription is flawed and sometimes leads to people being deprived of effective treatments.
- A gray market for drugs can emerge when effective drugs are made unavailable through official channels.

Key questions
- Why are the FDA approval and patent system so stringent? Is this necessary to protect patients or is it slowed progress in medical innovation?
- Is there a way to better leverage international research efforts and collaborate more effectively across borders?
- Is it ethically defensible to prevent patients from accessing effective treatments, even if their use may carry certain risks?

# Ozy’s Anti Heartiste FAQ
*August 20, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/20/ozys-anti-heartiste-faq/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The blog post is an Anti-Heartiste FAQ, meant to rebut common beliefs within the "manosphere"
- Heartiste believes that men are primarily attracted to young, thin, hot women and that women have a dual sex drive, pursuing "alpha males" for sexual attraction and "beta males" for resources and commitment
- The author argues that even if Heartiste's practical advice works, his conclusions about how the dating marketplace works do not follow
- Heartiste's claims about men's preferences in women are not backed up by evidence.
- Cultural and historical examples disprove Heartiste's claims about men's preferences for thin women.
- The correlation between sluttiness and divorce is confounded, and other factors like traditional/libertine values and age at first marriage may be more important.
- Men's preferences for feminine or masculine personalities in women are influenced by their belief in traditional gender roles.
- Women are not attracted to jerks; people end up in abusive relationship
- Rape fantasies are not indicative of a desire to be raped
- The number of sexual partners doesn't determine attractiveness; sluts are not inherently evil
- Heartiste's advice to "be more of a jerk" may work for some men who have internalized harmful societal messages about how to treat women, but it may also turn off women who value respect.
- Game techniques like negging and takeaways may work to increase attraction in some women, but it is important to consider the context and the type of woman being targeted.
- Women may prefer charming, poor men with interesting jobs over charmless, rich men who only talk about their jobs.
- Women and men rationalize about sex
- Self-report data on sexuality is unreliable
- Women follow their sexual attraction to have sex
- Women tend to be less interested in casual sex than men are
- Status and contribution of resources do not matter as much as one's ability to provide pleasure during sex
- Heartiste's beliefs are not always upsetting to his readers
- Scott gives dating and sex advice to men based on his own experiences.
- He advises filtering out people with eating disorders and avoiding demisexuals if the goal is casual sex.
- Scott empathizes with men's desire to date strippers but advises against hitting on them at work.

Key learnings:
- Beauty norms may be a product of biology and environment working together
- There may be some beauty standards that are culturally invariant, such as symmetrical faces and waist-to-hip ratio
- Studies have not found meaningful correlations between rated facial attractiveness and physical health
- It is important to examine and challenge claims made without evidence, even if they seem plausible.
- Cultural and historical examples can provide useful counterarguments to generalizations about preferences that ignore their diversity.
- Correlations may be confounded, and multiple factors need to be considered to understand complex issues like the relationship between sluttiness and divorce.
- People's preferences are influenced by their beliefs and societal values, and not solely determined by biological factors.
- Abuse victims aren't attracted to abusers, they are simply targeted
- Romance novels and fantasy are not an accurate depiction of women's desires
- Sexual attraction cannot be generalized or simplified
- The effectiveness of game techniques is dependent on the context and the type of woman being targeted.
- It is important to consider what kind of masculinity certain women are attracted to, rather than assuming that all women want the same thing.
- Putting in time and effort in a relationship, rather than just spending money, may be more effective in creating attraction.
- It is important to question societal biases when interpreting self-report data on sexuality
- One's sexual attraction plays a significant role in whom they choose to have sex with
- Women may be less interested in casual sex due to factors such as the orgasm gap, cultural norms, and concerns about safety
- Women tend to prioritize sexual pleasure and satisfaction over status and resources when choosing sexual partners
- It's important to consider one's goals before pursuing a relationship or sexual encounter.
- Using common sense and being respectful can reduce the risk of false accusations of rape.
- Scott suggests seeking dating advice from sources that prioritize honesty and practicality.

Key questions:
- What are Heartiste's beliefs about human sexual interaction?
- How do environmental factors influence notions of beauty and sexual attraction?
- Does it make evolutionary sense for men to target pretty girls for casual sex?
- What other stereotypes or generalizations are prevalent in discussions of gender and relationships that need to be questioned and challenged?
- How can we encourage more nuanced and diverse representations of attractiveness and desirability in media and culture?
- How can we create more open and accepting attitudes towards sexuality and sexual behavior that reduce shame and stigma?
- Why are people attracted to abusive relationships?
- Do rape fantasies indicate a desire to be raped?
- What factors determine a person's willingness to engage in sexual behavior?
- Is it possible to teach men how to be respectful and considerate towards women without telling them to "be more of a jerk"?
- Are there certain types of women who are more likely to fall for game techniques? How do these techniques work on women who don't fit within that group?
- How can we challenge harmful stereotypes about what is considered attractive in men and women, and promote more diverse and accepting standards of beauty?
- Is self-report data on sexuality completely useless or just flawed?
- How does the orgasm gap impact women's interest in casual sex?
- What social factors contribute to women being less interested in casual sex than men?
- How important is the ability to provide sexual pleasure in choosing sexual partners for all genders?
- What are demisexuals, and why does Scott advise against dating them for casual sex?
- How can men navigate dating in a way that minimizes drama and risk?
- What are some reliable resources for dating advice?

# Nobody Likes A Tattletale
*August 23, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/23/nobody-likes-a-tattletale/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- One of Scott's patients managed to smuggle heroin into the hospital and got high.
- Scott feels disappointed in the patient who told him about it.
- Dislike of tattletales seems to be a human universal.
- This raises the question of whether it's ethical to break an immoral contract.

Key learnings:
- It's not realistic to expect heroin addicts to follow rules.
- Dislike of tattletales is common but irrational.
- Ethical promises are necessary to ensure Pareto-optimal deals.

Key questions:
- Is dislike of tattletales a human universal?
- What is the value of credible promises?
- Is it ethical to break an immoral contract?

# The Invisible Nation – Reconciling Utilitarianism And Contractualism
*August 24, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/24/the-invisible-nation-reconciling-utilitarianism-and-contractualism/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The Economists' Paradise is a world where all game-theoretic problems are solved and all transactions are honest and voluntary.
- It is possible to use this paradigm to solve many real-world problems, such as world hunger and bullying.
- The author argues that the State can be used to enforce moral laws if certain conditions are met.
- The concept of Economists’ Paradise, where rational agents in a perfect world make agreements that would work without exception.
- The idea of the patchwork of agreements collapsing into a single pact as practical concerns arise.
- The Economists’ Paradise aims at solving coordination problems to keep everyone happy and prosperous and free.
- The rules of the Economists' Paradise involve negotiation and adherence to agreements using good economist and game theory.
- Good negotiation techniques would end in a multitude of possible good outcomes.
- Negotiation techniques leading to extreme local minima where everything is Pareto-optimal but nobody is happy would lead everyone coordinating to sign a pact not to use those negotiation techniques.

Key learnings:
- The Economists' Paradise can be seen as a way to achieve an ideal world without wars or crime.
- Clear rules and effective enforcement are necessary for the Economists' Paradise to work.
- The State can be a powerful tool in enforcing moral laws, but tradeoffs must be considered.
- Economists’ Paradise might be sufficient to bridge the gap between Rawls' Veil of Ignorance and Utilitarians’ Paradise.
- The agreement that everyone or almost everyone would sign is important, leading to a utilitarianism-like approach.
- Rules of the Economists' Paradise are hard to determine and enforce, and different techniques lead to different results.
- Rules can be enforced by the State or voluntarily followed in the privacy of individuals.
- Utilitarianism is one good heuristic for the rules, while contractualism solves some of utilitarianism's problems.
- Inspirational values and practical wisdom are necessary to improve heuristics and rules.

Key questions:
- What are the challenges involved in convincing people to follow the rules necessary for the Economists' Paradise to work?
- How can algorithmization of rules be used to prevent fallible human judgment from influencing enforcement?
- What can be done to ensure that the State's enforcement of moral laws does not lead to tyranny or poor implementation?
- How can the assumption of perfect coordination in Economists’ Paradise be applied to other contexts?
- Is there a way to solve bullying in the Least Convenient Possible World, assuming Economists’ Paradise is valid?
- How can the concept of Economists’ Paradise bridge the gap between Utilitarians’ Paradise and Rawls' Veil of Ignorance?
- How do we ensure that different negotiation techniques yielding different results conform to the rules of the Economists' Paradise?
- How do we effectively enforce rules that are hard to determine and enforce?
- Can contractualism ultimately be a better alternative to utilitarianism?

*August 26, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/26/if-the-media-reported-on-other-dangers-like-it-does-ai-risk/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The media has done a better job than expected at reporting on dangerous scenarios that could become reality.
- Climate change, nuclear war, economic crashes, asteroid impacts, hurricanes, invasion threats, and superplagues are all potential dangers.

Key learnings:
- Laypeople shouldn't worry too much about carbon dioxide levels yet.
- A large nuclear war could have major economic consequences, as well as being devastating in other ways.
- The science behind some of these potential disasters may be complex, and there could be disagreement among experts.

# More Links For August
*August 28, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/28/more-links-for-august/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The man who set the record for fastest drive across the US did it in 28 hours 50 minutes.
- Environmentalist groups are supporting opponents of their cause who are less bad than others from their party.
- People who are richer, whiter, and better educated are less likely to support prizes for participation.
- Marijuana use may not be involved in more fatal accidents in Colorado after legalization.
- Climate geo-engineering is seen as a more attractive solution for reversing some effects of global warming.
- Poverty has no ability to explain criminality rates.
- An analysis of a study showing that "connectedness and sense of purpose" can influence gene expression in positive ways has proved that its statistical methods are flawed.
- Israeli wars may not be aimed at changing things but rather as some sort of tension-release cycle to maintain status quo.

Key learnings
- Supporting opponents of your cause who are less bad than others from their party can serve as an incentive for opposing politicians to moderate their views.
- Personal identity is a concept that needs to be jettisoned.
- Poverty may have no ability to explain criminality rates.
- A critical analysis of a study can reveal flaws in the statistical methods used to find a certain effect.

Key questions
- Why do richer, whiter, and more educated individuals support winner-take-all policies?
- Does poverty have no role in causing criminality rates?
- What is the implication of the flawed statistical methods used in the study that showed that "connectedness and sense of purpose" can impact gene expression?

# Radicalizing the Romanceless
*August 31, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/31/radicalizing-the-romanceless/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The author discusses the idea of fairness in society through the lens of hard work and entitlement.
- He reflects on his own past as a "nice guy" and his frustrations with being romantically unsuccessful.
- The author provides examples of feminists who mock and criticize "nice guys."
- The author criticizes the “make fun of Poor Minorities” community for self-labeling themselves as experts in determining who is entitled and who is not.
- The author shares his experience being a lonely and single man and how he feels that his ability to complain about it has been ruined by MRAs and anti-feminists.
- The author doubts B’s belief that the “manosphere” flooding the discourse is at fault for men’s romantic problems.
- The author argues that the feminist war on “nice guys” could have caused the rise of the manosphere.
- The author compares the manosphere to the Dazexiang Uprising and suggests that their cruelty is what makes lonely men lash out.
- Evolutionary psychology explains innate desire for companionship and warmth
- Virginity statistics suggest that certain traits are correlated with romancelessness
- B, a feminist man, struggles with finding romantic relationships
- Different approaches to answering B’s struggles, some more productive than others

Key learnings:
- Hard work does not necessarily equate to success.
- Entitlement and a lack of self-awareness can contribute to feelings of unfairness.
- There is a subset of feminism that criticizes and stereotypes "nice guys."
- The use of the term “entitled” by the “make fun of Poor Minorities” community is problematic and unhelpful.
- The issues faced by lonely men are complicated and affected by different factors.
- The manosphere and the feminist war on “nice guys” seem to be feeding off each other.
- Being mean and cruel can only lead to more anger and bitterness.
- Companionship and warmth are innate needs
- Virginity statistics show certain traits are correlated with romancelessness
- Personal virtue is weakly correlated with finding romantic relationships
- The manosphere and feminism have some good and bad elements

Key questions:
- How do we define fairness in society?
- What role do entitlement and self-awareness play in our views of fairness?
- What impact do societal expectations of masculinity and relationships have on individuals who identify as "nice guys?"
- Why do people like to label and generalize others, especially those who are different from them?
- How can we address the issues faced by lonely men without promoting misogyny, racism, or other harmful beliefs?
- Can the stigma attached to being lonely and single be lifted, and how?
- What can we learn from the story of the Dazexiang Uprising and apply it to our current situation?
- Why are some men unable to find romantic relationships?
- How can feminism and the manosphere work together to address the issue?
- What resources should men consult in order to address romantic struggles?

# Book Review and Highlights: Quantum Computing Since Democritus
*September 1, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/01/book-review-and-highlights-quantum-computing-since-democritus/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The author struggled to understand the book "Quantum Computing Since Democritus".
- The book discusses God's obsession with enforcing rules about certain types of information and ties it to computational complexity theory.
- The author highlights interesting, funny, or enlightening quotes from the book.
- Anthropics and self-sampling assumptions (SSA) are related to the problem of generating a solution for NP-complete problems.

Key learnings:
- The book draws a connection between God's rules about information and computational complexity theory.
- The author gained a basic understanding of the book but not a full understanding.
- The author learned about the No-Cloning Theorem.
- SSA predicts that, with overwhelming probability, they will pick a satisfying assignment.
- Engaging skeptics can lead to new research ideas.

Key questions:
- How successful is Aaronson in tying computational complexity theory into areas such as philosophy?
- How big would the rule book for the Chinese Room argument have to be to carry out an intelligent conversation in anything resembling real time?
- Why was it necessary to perform experiments to learn about quantum mechanics?
- How likely is it that Adam and Eve would be the first two observers, given that they have chosen an unsatisfying assignment?
- How to generate good ideas?
- How to deal with the anti-induction philosophy?

# The Guardian vs. Induction
*September 3, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/03/the-guardian-vs-induction/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The 1972 book Limits to Growth has been criticized for predicting civilization would probably collapse some time this century.
- Research from the University of Melbourne has found the book’s forecasts on target.
- The article outlines some graphs of important environment variables and points out the flaw in assuming a decline starting around 2015.
- The grue-bleen induction problem is examined by the author.

Key learnings
- Predicting dramatic change is hard; success with one doesn’t necessarily imply success with the other.
- There is still a lot of good arguments that collapse could happen.
- The data presented here provides only a small amount of evidence.

Key questions
- Does the conclusion from The Guardian urge readers to sound the appropriate alarm bell?
- The grue-bleen induction problem is an exotic and especially perverse reasoning process that no real person would fall for. Do philosophers agree with this?

# Cooperation Un-Veiled
*September 4, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/04/cooperation-un-veiled/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Contractualism attempts to derive morality from an agreement that selfish agents would willingly sign.
- Rawls' "veil of ignorance" thought experiment helps to get us closer to utilitarianism.
- A society of 100 men with varying strength levels and a god enforcing agreements is used to explore oppressive interactions.
- A hierarchy of agreement banning certain types of oppression is proposed, but it ultimately fails due to people's self-interest.

Key learnings:
- Real-life power differentials affect moral standards and utility ratios.
- One-size-fits-all utilitarianism can be replaced by power-based utility ratios.
- Hierarchies of agreements have flaws in the face of self-interest and the inability to predict others' actions.

Key questions:
- How can superrational bases be established for cooperation in situations like the iterated 100 prisoners dilemma and the society of 100 men?
- Would adding a coalition agreement to gang up against opponents change the outcome of the oppressive interaction model?

# Mapmaker, Mapmaker, Make Me A Map
*September 5, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/05/mapmaker-mapmaker-make-me-a-map/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The author wanted to create a concept-map of the rationalist community.
- The map includes external communities that have communication with the rationalist community.
- The city size on the map is proportional to site Alexa rank, number of followers, or a wild guess if unavailable.
- The author apologizes if he missed a community, and many of his choices were random.

Key learnings:
- The map shows the various communities that are part of the rationalist community and their links.
- The city size on the map reflects the popularity of the community.
- The author's choices were based on who he knew about, and not including a community was not intentional.

Key questions:
- What are the other communities that have significant communication/cross-pollination with the rationalist community?
- How accurate are the estimates for city size on the map?
- How can the map be improved in the future?

# Links For September 2014
*September 8, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/08/links-for-september-2014/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- A study has found that women who identify as feminist have masculinized finger ratios, leading to a possible explanation for the "feminist paradox".
- Hal Finney, a Bitcoin pioneer, has passed away from ALS and been cryonically frozen.
- A compound found in some algae can cause an individual to feel like cold things are hot and hot things are cold.
- The alternative arithmetic Presburger arithmetic is being considered for use in math, due to its provable consistency and completeness.
- The CEO of McDonald's is a roboticist who originally thought he was going to an interview with McDonnell-Douglas.

Key learnings:
- SAMe, a sorta-natural supplement, is reportedly as effective or better than traditional antidepressants.
- Growing up poor or in a bad neighborhood has been found to not significantly increase the likelihood of committing crimes as an adult.
- Vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent serious diseases, and anti-vaccination arguments can be easily debunked.
- The Ivy League college admissions process perpetuates advantages for the wealthy, and standardized tests should be used more to level the playing field.

Key questions:
- Do feminists actually have masculinized finger ratios, or are there other factors at play?
- What implications does the cryonic freezing of Hal Finney have for the future of life extension?
- Can the algal toxin causing the sensation of hot/cold inversion be used as a party trick?
- What other alternative math systems are being considered and for what purposes?
- How can standardized tests be made more accessible to lower income individuals to ensure fairness in college admissions?

# Society Is Fixed, Biology Is Mutable
*September 10, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/10/society-is-fixed-biology-is-mutable/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- There is a stereotype that the Left believes in social determinism and the Right believes in biological determinism, but the author rejects this premise.
- Society is difficult to change, but biology is more easily changeable.
- Biological explanations should not be ignored in favor of social solutions.

Key learnings:
- Some problems, such as drug abuse and obesity, may have biological explanations that can be addressed more directly than social solutions.
- Multivitamin supplementation and later school start times may be effective interventions for certain problems.
- Genetic explanations are not as scary as they seem, and implantable contraception could be an effective solution.

Key questions:
- Is it possible that there are problems that have both biological and social explanations that need to be addressed simultaneously?
- How can we shift our focus to incorporate biological explanations without completely ignoring social solutions?
- What other interventions could be implemented at the biological level to target social problems?

# What The Hell, Hegel?
*September 12, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/12/what-the-hell-hegel/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The focus on Marx’s influence from Hegel is a great feature of Marx: A Very Short Introduction. 
- Hegel was an extremely important philosopher during the 19th century, but now, he has many critics. 

Key learnings:
- Philosophy can rarely unite around a single consensus belief, and it rarely disproves anything thoroughly enough to admit the error.
- There are alternative ways to read a historical text, such as reading it backwards to identify which ideas are influential today.

Key questions:
- Is the reason Hegel has fallen out of favor simply because he was a crackpot or there are other reasons?
- What parts of our thinking today are the result of Hegelian ideas, and how much do we really know about Hegelian philosophy?

# Book Review: Singer on Marx
*September 13, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/13/book-review-singer-on-marx/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The author chose a summary and commentary book over primary sources to learn more about leftist philosophy
- Marx opposed planning the structure of communist governments or economies on principle
- Marx believed that there was no such thing as human nature and everything was completely malleable
- Capitalism involves collective irrationality
- Marx's insight on capitalism was not original to him
- Marx believed that labor creates all value and that capitalists are oppressing laborers by taking a large share of the gains produced.
- In Marx's view, if laborers remove capitalists, they can direct their productive power in the most useful manner.
- Marx assumed coordination to be instantaneous in the absence of any obstacles to coordination.
- Coordination is crucial to the explanation of the contribution of capitalists.

Key learnings:
- Reading primary sources is not always the best way to understand certain thinkers and philosophies
- Marx opposed planning the structure of communist governments or economies on principle because he believed it was a scientific law that a perfect communist government would form of its own accord
- Marx believed that human nature was completely malleable
- Capitalism involves collective irrationality that leads to a society that no one controls
- Marx's assumption that coordination is easy led to his belief that capitalists are useless.
- To get rid of all forms of competition, free rider problems, and other issues, a system better than capitalism needs to be invented.

Key questions:
- Is there another way to deal with the collision of Marxist doctrine with reality besides returning to the purity of Marx?
- Was Marx's insight on capitalism original to him or did he borrow it from previous thinkers?
- Did Marx have the clarity of thought to understand the system that could solve the issues better than capitalism?
- What system can address issues like competition, free rider problems, and tragedies of the commons better than capitalism?

# Does Class Warfare Have A Free-Rider Problem?
*September 14, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/14/does-class-warfare-have-a-free-rider-problem/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Coordination problems arise when rich people try to influence government policies for their own benefit.
- Free rider problems and the need for concerted effort of all rich people make coordination harder.
- Rich people may have a harder time than good people rallying support for important causes due to the nature of their interests.
- An appeal to principle works better in normal politics than "soak the poor to line our own pockets" campaign.
- Rich people's participation in politics might be influenced by sincere belief in their moral values that coincidentally help make them richer.

Key learnings
- Rich people don't seem to directly coordinate to bribe politicians in their favor.
- Rich people could participate in politics due to sincere belief in their moral values that help drive their self-interest.
- A moral system that is self-sacrificing on an individual level but helps the rich person get richer may emerge without conscious awareness.

Key questions
- Is there a spooky system that generates heartfelt moral philosophies on demand to solve coordination problems?
- If the rich are not actually coordinating, why do they consistently keep getting lucky?
- Why don't the poor coordinate as well as the rich?
- How much more credence should we give other conspiracy theories?

# [Ozy] A Response to Spandrell
*September 15, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/15/ozy-a-response-to-spandrell/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The argument that homosexuality is not a naturally selected trait is not supported by the observation of animal homosexuality in almost 500 species.
- A Swedish twin study suggests that sexual orientation in humans is less inborn than previously thought.
- Women's tendency to lie about sex means that female paraphiliacs may exist despite them being underrepresented in research.
- Women's sexuality may be more defined by narrative paraphilias than male sexuality.
- Autogynephilia could be considered ordinary female sexuality.
- The idea that trans women have male sex drives is not supported by the medical treatment they receive.
- The author is not an autoandrophile and clarifies that being trans is not just a matter of social dysphoria.

Key learnings
- Animal homosexuality challenges the idea that homosexuality is not a naturally occurring trait.
- Sexual orientation in humans is likely less inborn than previously thought.
- Research on female sexuality may be biased by women's propensity to lie about sexual matters.
- Narrative paraphilias may be more common in women than men.
- Autogynephilia could be considered within the range of ordinary female sexuality.
- Medical treatments for trans women are effective in reducing male sex drive.
- Being transgender is not just a matter of wanting to switch genders.

Key questions
- What factors contribute to the prevalence of animal homosexuality across species?
- How else might the bias in women's self-reported sexual behaviors impact research on women's sexuality?
- Are there additional differences in the makeup of male and female sexuality that influence the prevalence of paraphilias?
- What additional research is needed to clarify the relationship between autogynephilia and gender identity?
- How do trans individuals' experiences of their gender differ from the experience of dysphoria or discomfort encapsulated in the term "autoandrophilia"?

## Summary
Key ideas
- America is medicalizing normal childhood mischief and giving stimulants as part of the pathologization of everyday life.
- ADHD is both overdiagnosed and underdiagnosed due to the limitations of sensitivity and specificity statistics in psychiatric diagnosis.

Key learnings
- ADHD is a complex condition to diagnose and both overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis occur simultaneously.
- Sensitivity and specificity statistics are important considerations in psychiatric diagnosis.
- Ritalin and other medications may be both overprescribed and underprescribed.

Key questions

# Streetlight Psychology
*September 24, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/24/streetlight-psychology/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The Vox article concludes that the relationship between violent video games and actual violence is unknown.
- Studies that use aggression and self-control as proxies for real-world violence are insufficiently skeptical.
- Laboratory studies are problematic as they do not provide long-term information and instead offer information on immediate responses.
- The streetlight effect, which refers to researchers studying what is easy to study, is prevalent in the fields of videogamology and the science of prejudice and racism.
- Children may respond to presence rather than long-term changes in their environment.

Key learnings
- The relationship between violent video games and actual violence is largely unknown.
- Studies that use aggression and self-control as proxies for real-world violence do not provide long-term information.
- The streetlight effect, which refers to researchers studying what is easy to study, is prevalent in some fields of psychology.
- Children may respond to presence rather than long-term changes in their environment.

Key questions
- What are the potential long-term effects of playing violent video games that laboratory studies do not show?
- In what ways can immediate responses to a situation differ from long-term changes in behavior or thinking?
- How can researchers avoid the streetlight effect and focus on studying principles that offer meaningful insights into human behavior?

# Book Review: Red Plenty
*September 24, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/24/book-review-red-plenty/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The book "Red Plenty" is a semi-fictionalized account of the history of socialist economic planning in the USSR.
- Despite the well-known advantages of capitalism over communism, the Soviets believed that communism could be better at economic growth and making people richer quickly.
- The book suggests that the Soviet economy failed primarily because of allocation issues and the lack of a price mechanism to allocate resources.
- In the 1960s, Soviet computer scientist Viktor Glushkov proposed using cybernetics to create a centralized economic planning system.
- Glushkov and Nobel laureate Leonid Kantorovich were never given the chance to fully develop their ideas for a planned economy.
- The Soviet Union had practically no social science or professional economists due to its association with capitalism.
- The Soviet Union was a republic in name only and its leaders were gangsters who pretended to be social scientists.
- The Soviet economy continued to rely on heavy industry and failed to produce goods that corresponded to human needs.

Key learnings:
- Linear programming, a method of solving optimization problems, was invented by the Soviet mathematician Leonid Kantorovich and could have potentially solved the allocation issues faced in the Soviet economy.
- The Soviet leaders were constrained in their ability to implement economic reforms, and the adoption of some elements of linear programming was piecemeal and toothless.
- Glushkov and Kantorovich proposed an innovative way to solve the problem of economic planning.
- Centralized economic planning might have been able to outperform prices, but the Soviet Union never gave it a chance.
- Despite having highly educated leaders, the Soviet Union lacked social science and was governed by gangsters.
- The Soviet economy's focus on heavy industry and lack of stop signals led to the creation of unwanted goods.

Key questions:
- What are the implications of the lack of a price mechanism in the Soviet economy?
- Why were the Soviet leaders unable to mobilize enough political capital to implement the reforms suggested by Kantorovich?
- What can we learn from the failures of communism in the USSR, and how can we apply those lessons to modern economic systems?
- Could Kantorovich and Glushkov's proposed centralized economic planning system have worked if they were given the chance to develop it fully?
- What would have happened if the Soviet Union had invested in social science and professional economists?
- How did the Soviet Union's leaders become more interested in maintaining their own power than in implementing their stated ideals?

# Why No Science Of Nerds?
*September 25, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/25/why-no-science-of-nerds/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- There is a lack of scientific study of "nerds" despite the common characteristics associated with them.
- These common characteristics include being smart, interested in math and science, shy and awkward, bad at getting social status, etc.
- Possible reasons for these correlated characteristics include social status loss due to physical traits, interests being a result of lack of social skills, etc.
- Testosterone and sex hormones play a role in these characteristics but do not necessarily explain the whole picture.

Key learnings:
- There is an absence of scientific exploration of "nerds" despite their common characteristics.
- Possible reasons for these characteristics include various factors such as social status loss, interests stemming from lack of social skills, and even below-average levels of testosterone.
- Hormones such as testosterone undoubtedly play a role in these correlated characteristics but do not encapsulate the whole picture.

Key questions:
- Are there any differences in "nerd" culture across different times and cultures?
- What could explain the correlated characteristics of "nerds" (e.g., shyness, disinterest in sports, love for math, etc.)?
- What role do hormones such as testosterone play in these correlated characteristics?
- How can we expand our understanding of sex hormones and their effects? 
- What explains the cluster of transwomen who have traditional male characteristics and are nerdy?
- Are there distinct differences between male and female nerds in terms of characteristics such as attractiveness and athleticism?

# Cuddle Culture
*September 27, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/27/cuddle-culture/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Heartiste's recent post attacks polyamory, claiming that genuine, egalitarian, open polyamory doesn't exist among white Westerners.
- The author, Scott, agrees with Heartiste that polyamory is well-suited for asexual people, and that a disproportionate number of asexual polyamorous people exist.
- Scott sees cuddling as a way to experience pure universal love, and views it as the opposite of objectification.
- In the nerdy, polyamorous communities Scott has been in, cuddling is normalized and considered acceptable for people of all genders.

Key learnings:
- Polyamory and asexuality can work well together, especially for asexual people, by providing protection against sexual jealousy and the ability to date sexual people without worrying about satisfying their high sex drive.
- Cuddling can be a way to experience pure universal love, and in certain communities, it is normalized and encouraged.

Key questions:
- What is the impact of the formation of communities where cuddling is normalized and accepted, and are there any negative consequences?
- Why do a disproportionate number of asexual polyamorous people exist, and what are the reasons for their success in polyamorous relationships?
- Is it possible to form cohesive communities around non-sexual activities, and what factors contribute to the success of such communities?

# Bottomless Pits Of Suffering
*September 27, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/27/bottomless-pits-of-suffering/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Utilitarianism becomes unintuitive and scary when making a decision that affects a domain unrelated to the decision maker.
- The developing world is similar to a bottomless pit that we expect to be there and are happy to help, but nursing homes and prisons are often ignored.
- Nursing homes and prisons are problems that are expensive to solve with no clear visible gain, and may require resources from other important causes.

Key learnings
- Utilitarianism can be difficult to apply in situations that involve making sacrifices for domains that individuals may not perceive as part of their "normal world."
- While some issues, such as suffering in the developing world, are acknowledged and regularly addressed, other problems, like abuse in nursing homes and violence in prisons, are often ignored despite being equally important.

Key questions
- How can utilitarianism be applied in situations that require making sacrifices to help other domains unrelated to the decision-maker's experience?
- Why do we acknowledge some problems, such as suffering in the developing world, while ignoring others, such as abuse in nursing homes and violence in prisons?
- What can be done to address problems like abuse in nursing homes and violence in prisons, which are expensive to solve and have no clear visible gain?

# I Can Tolerate Anything Except The Outgroup
*September 30, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The Secret of Father Brown by Chesterton presents a lesson on forgiveness, highlighting the different types of forgiveness: genuine and fake forgiveness.
- Genuine forgiveness is difficult and requires penance and self-reflection whereas fake forgiveness is easy since it only forgives things that don't hurt the forgiver.
- Tolerance, as defined by respect and kindness toward an outgroup, is considered a virtue but is often conflated with fake forgiveness.
- Outgroups are defined by proximity plus small differences that can change on a dime, resulting in unexpected alliances and friend/foe designations.
- People tend to self-segregate into tribes that have distinguishing characteristics, such as political beliefs, religious beliefs, and behaviors.
- These tribes are stronger categories than politics.
- The filter bubble segregates people based on implicit tribal characteristics.
- Belief congruence theory suggests that differences in beliefs are more important than demographic factors in forming in-groups and outgroups.
- Americans have a complicated relationship with patriotism and their own country.
- The terms "American" and "white" can be used as code words for political affiliations.
- People are more likely to be angry at their political outgroup rather than groups they see as truly threatening.
- There are two parallel universes in America: the Blue Tribe and the Red Tribe.
- There are tribes like Blue Tribe and Red Tribe that have their own beliefs, opinions, and cultures.
- Anger and hatred towards the outgroup or the opposing tribe for opposing the ingroup’s beliefs causes in-group favoritism and out-group bashing.
- The essay reflects the same mistake by savagely attacking the Blue Tribe, expecting virtuousness and nobility.

Key learnings:
- Forgiveness and tolerance are complicated topics that are often misunderstood.
- Genuine forgiveness is difficult and requires more than just words.
- Outgroups are often defined by small differences and not necessarily by hostility.
- Political tribes self-segregate to an impressive extent based on their implicit tribal characteristics.
- Implicit partisan biases are half again as strong as unconscious racial biases.
- Discrimination on the basis of party is much stronger than discrimination on the basis of race.
- Belief congruence theory suggests that in those contexts where social pressure is nonexistent, belief is more important than race as a determinant of racial or ethnic discrimination.
- Political polarization in America has led to a lack of interaction between people with different political affiliations.
- People are more likely to be angry at the outgroup they see as threatening rather than groups that they have no interaction with.
- Terms like "American" and "white" can be used as code words for political affiliations, rather than as literal descriptions.
- Criticising the ingroup is difficult, but it takes nerves of steel to criticise them.
- There should be an effort in figuring out how to be more tolerant.
- Being tolerant is not easy, but it is necessary to make progress towards a better society.

Key questions:
- What is the difference between genuine and fake forgiveness?
- Why is tolerance often conflated with fake forgiveness?
- How can we cultivate genuine forgiveness and tolerance in ourselves?
- How do we end up with such intense political segregation?
- Are these tribes based on geography, race, ethnic origin, religion, IQ, or what TV channels you watched as a kid?
- What is the precise meaning of the Implicit Association Test with political parties?
- Is belief congruence theory supportive of a weak or strong version of itself?
- Why is patriotism such a complicated concept for many Americans?
- How do we bridge the divide between the Blue Tribe and the Red Tribe?
- How can we encourage interaction and understanding between people with different political affiliations?
- How can people move beyond in-group favoritism and out-group bashing?
- How can individuals learn to criticise their own tribe for correct reasons successfully?
- How to build the mental skills necessary to criticise one's Ingroup?

# Prediction Goes To War
*October 5, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/10/05/prediction-goes-to-war/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The availability of accurate predictions by oracles could prevent wars between countries.
- However, the use of oracular predictions for settling wars could lead to an increase in wars due to countries being more willing to invade.
- Prediction markets, coupled with futarchy, can be a potential solution to avoid wars between rational countries.
- Wars between superintelligences could be resolved through negotiations based on compromise of values and prediction of outcomes.

Key learnings:
- Accurate oracular predictions can have significant implications on countries' decisions to engage in wars.
- Using oracles to settle wars can lead to an increase in the number of wars.
- Prediction markets and futarchies can potentially help prevent wars between rational countries.

Key questions:
- What factors lead countries to decide to engage in a war despite accurate predictions?
- Can futarchy be applied practically on a large scale to avoid wars between countries?
- How can countries ensure that prediction markets remain unbiased and accurate?

# Tumblr on MIRI
*October 7, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/10/07/tumblr-on-miri/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- MIRI is a nonprofit organization dedicated to the risks surrounding "intelligence explosion".
- MIRI works to create more stable goal systems that allow AIs to become intelligent or superintelligent while still acting in predictable and human-friendly ways.
- MIRI has been successful in outreach and networking. It has gotten attention and endorsements from people like Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk, and Peter Thiel.
- MIRI conducts academic research, has publications, book chapters, and other things associated with normal academic research.
- MIRI's researchers are not considered to be as prestigious as those at other organizations.
- MIRI has shifted their focus from outreach and strategic research to pure math research in recent years.
- MIRI has not published much research due to their previous focus on strategic research and outreach.
- There is a lack of citations for MIRI's work.
- MIRI has recruited new researchers and seeks to hire a full-time science writer.
- The New York rationalist group takes a more combative approach to academia, arguing that it is too focused on publishing papers and citations rather than actual progress.
- The author agrees with the rationalist group, criticizing the process of official, published research as a "crappy game."
- One member of the community argues that the direct measure of MIRI's success in outreach is through citations, of which MIRI's is very low.
- There is disagreement over whether MIRI's success in bringing AI risk to the public eye deserves credit or if they failed to follow up.
- MIRI has done a poor job getting published and cited results in journals, which is necessary for robust mathematical progress.

Key learnings:
- MIRI is successful in getting attention, press coverage, and interest from smart people not in the field. This is good fundraising and PR, but it doesn't mean they're good at anything else.
- MIRI needs more support from smart people in the fields of math, AI, and computer science.
- MIRI's output may not be as impressive as expected by those familiar with academic culture. It seems to have gotten about five ten solid publications in during its decade-long history as a multi-person organization; one good grad student can get a couple solid publications a year.
- MIRI has many employees/associates with strong qualifications and published work in math and compsci.
- MIRI has been unsuccessful in getting academic interest and citations despite their efforts.
- There is a debate over the best way to measure success and progress in a new field, particularly with regards to AI risk.
- Building up public interest and garnering media attention is a good first step, but it must be followed up with published papers and citations to achieve real progress.
- Inexperience and lack of experience in academic writing may be a limiting factor for MIRI and other similar organizations.

Key questions:
- What is the difference between outreach and self-promotion?
- Is MIRI successful in outreach if it gets Stephen Hawking to say "We need to be more concerned about AI risks, as described by organizations like MIRI"?
- Does MIRI have enough support from smart people in the fields of math, AI, and computer science?
- How many brilliant PhDs from top universities should MIRI have given their limited budget?
- Should MIRI be focusing on publishing more to gain academic interest and citations?
- Is the lack of published research for MIRI purely due to their emphasis on strategic research and outreach in the past?
- What is the best way to measure success and progress in a new field such as AI risk?
- How can small organizations like MIRI balance research and the need for publishing papers and citations?
- How can those with experience in academic writing or other fields help advance progress in this area?

# Five Planets In Search Of A Sci-Fi Story
*October 12, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/10/12/five-planets-in-search-of-a-sci-fi-story/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Gamma Andromeda: Inhabitants use electrical shocks and opiates to maintain equanimity.
- Zyzzx Prime: Alien race releases hormones upon reaching high social status, diminishing mental acuity.
- K’th’ranga V: Global theocracy unable to keep up with modernization; priest-kings move to an island to preserve purity.
- Chan X-3: Native species evolved as fitness-maximizers, utilizing giant vats full of frozen DNA to maximize gene copies.
- New Capricorn: Colony achieves cure for death, but elderly population succumbs to Alzheimer's and other conditions.

Key learnings
- Equanimity is difficult to achieve and maintain.
- High social status can have negative effects on mental acuity.
- Keeping up with modernization can be difficult, especially when it contradicts religious beliefs.
- Maximizing gene copies does not necessarily lead to survival of the species.
- Cure for death without a cure for aging can lead to other problems.

Key questions
- Can true equanimity be achieved or is it only a facade?
- How can societies prevent diminishing mental acuity among those in high social status?
- How can religious beliefs and modernization be reconciled?
- Is maximizing gene copies the best strategy for survival of a species?
- What are the ethical implications of a cure for death without a cure for aging?

# Five Case Studies On Politicization
*October 16, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/10/16/five-case-studies-on-politicization/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Ebola has been politicized in the US, with both political tribes taking opposing positions.
- There are three theories for how this happened: fear of disease and the root of conservatism, mutual reinforcement of political beliefs, and the adoption of a quarantine position that fits a party's narrative.
- Politicization isn't necessarily about what side you take, but what issues you emphasize.
- The Rotherham scandal in the UK was largely ignored by the Left, while the Right vocalized about it in relation to their established narratives.
- Left-leaning news websites and feminist websites had more coverage on the Jennifer Lawrence nude photo leaks than on the Rotherham child exploitation scandal.
- Ferguson and Rotherham were both cases of police misconduct involving race, but news sources covering one issue did not necessarily cover the other.
- Turning important topics into wedge issues that are used to insult and abuse opposing groups does not work.
- People interpret issues based on their political affiliation and use them to support their narrative.
- "Attack nerds" is a type of people trying to enforce traditional gender performance.
- Nerds should ally themselves with people who support alternative gender performance.
- The media has a role in promoting division and negative feelings between political groups.

Key learnings:
- Political tribes may take a position on an issue largely to fit their narrative, rather than objectively evaluating the situation.
- Politicization can be detrimental to addressing important issues and instead be used as a means to signal allegiance to one's tribe.
- Issues become tied to political narratives and stop being about themselves.
- The media covers issues based on their alignment with a particular narrative.
- Partisan affiliation influences one’s beliefs on certain issues.
- The media has the incentive to prioritize profits over promoting dialogue or understanding between political groups.
- Social pressure can influence people's opinions and beliefs.

Key questions:
- Is it possible for individuals to separate from their political tribe and make objective evaluations of issues?
- How can we effectively address important issues that have been politicized?
- What is the role of media in exacerbating political polarization and how can it be improved?
- Why do people seize upon different sides of a nonpolitical issue based on their political narrative?
- How can people be convinced to support an issue that is not aligned with their political narrative?
- How do people’s beliefs about an issue change when it becomes a Referendum On Everything?
- How can we incentivize the media to promote dialogue and understanding instead of division?
- Can we encourage more people to think for themselves, rather than be influenced by social pressure or outside factors?

# More Links For October 2014
*October 18, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/10/18/more-links-for-october-2014/

## Summary
Key Ideas:
- Evolution doesn't necessarily go from worse to better or less complex to more complex.
- Gut microbes may contribute to the pathogenesis of eating disorders.
- Lockheed Martin and Polywell people claim to have fusion reactors ready in ten years.
- Immigration does not increase unemployment or growth.
- The world's first fully vegetarian city bans animal slaughter and the sale of meat.

Key Learnings:
- Possibly, gut microbes may have something to do with the emergence of eating disorders.
- As of now, no prediction can confirm whether Lockheed Martin and Polywell people can deliver fusion reactors in ten years.
- Various studies suggest that immigration has no direct and significant contribution towards unemployment or growth.

Key Questions:
- Which study confirms that gut microbes may cause eating disorders, and what are the findings of said study?
- Are there any updates concerning Lockheed Martin's fusion reactors, and is it possible that these reactors are feasible?
- What are the limits of the data that suggest that immigration does not impact unemployment or growth?

# In The Future, Everyone Will Be Famous To Fifteen People
*October 20, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/10/20/in-the-future-everyone-will-be-famous-to-fifteen-people/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The number of classicists will eventually equal, and then exceed, the number of inhabitants in classical Greece.
- This will happen in about 2500, assuming human progress continues at its current rate, with a human population of five trillion spread out throughout the solar system and nearby stars.
- There may be revolutionary advances, like the chronoscope, which can see into the past.
- Barring any revolutionary advance in historical methodology, there won't be enough artifacts and texts to support 10 million classicists; hence, they will overanalyze excruciating details of the material that exists.
- Following this, historians would start looking into individual middle-class or lower-class Greeks, investigating their life stories, and how they tied in to the broader historical picture.
- There are debates and fields of study that generate a lot of interest, and there are some that do the opposite.

Key learnings
- The field of classics is growing at a faster rate than the population it studies.
- As the number of classicists grows, they will have to analyze the existing artifacts in excruciating detail and resort to looking into the lives of middle-class or lower-class Greeks.
- Bigger fields of study have their internal academic politics and yearly conferences.
- There are debates about fields with less interest generated.

Key questions
- Can we extrapolate to a future where there is a one-to-one ratio of classicists to classical Greeks, so that each scholar can study exactly one Greek?
- What will happen after the number of classicists exceeds the number of inhabitants in classical Greece?
- Does the proportion of classics majors remain constant as the population increases?

# Book Review: A Future For Socialism
*October 23, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/10/23/book-review-a-future-for-socialism/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Socialism is compatible with prosperity, innovation, and consumer satisfaction, as long as it is a form of capitalism.
- Nationalizing large industries and splitting them into stocks, which are given to every citizen, is a way to achieve socialism.
- The flow of stock coupons would give banks market-driven information that helps them make better funding decisions.
- Structure is essential for success.
- Scott shares his experience of struggling to follow structure.
- He realizes that structure is necessary for him to be productive and complete tasks.

Key learnings:
- Joint-stock corporations are an important philosophical and political idea that is necessary to understand when discussing socialism.
- Principal-agent problems can be solved poorly, as seen in Soviet and other communist economic systems.
- Having a routine and structure is crucial for productivity.
- It's okay to acknowledge that something may not work for you personally.
- Experimentation is necessary to find what structure works best for you.

Key questions:
- Won’t poor people sell their shares to rich people under Roemer’s proposed system?
- How do companies get nationalized?
- What happens when new companies, such as Google, want to start in a socialist system?
- How accurate is Roemer’s analysis of lobbying and its role in decision-making in the current system?
- How can I create a structure that works for me?
- What steps can I take to ensure I stick to my routine?
- How can I make adjustments to my structure if it's not working for me?

# Alcoholics Anonymous: Much More Than You Wanted To Know
*October 26, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/10/26/alcoholics-anonymous-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Studies surrounding Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) are poorly designed and interpreted.
- The field of addiction medicine is politicized and divisive.
- The efficacy of AA is controversial.
- Retention rates for AA are low.
- Controlled experiments are necessary to determine the effectiveness of AA.
- Alcoholism treatment studies often lack control groups due to ethical concerns
- Project MATCH, a multi-year, multi-million dollar study, found no significant difference between popular treatment methods for alcoholism
- Brief opportunistic interventions (asking a patient to quit drinking) are effective around 1 in 8 times
- Brief treatment studies show that intensive treatment methods are no more effective than brief interventions
- The efficacy of different types of psychotherapy is difficult to compare
- The efficacy of the Alcoholics Anonymous 12-step program is questionable and there is little evidence to support its success.
- For many people, a few minutes with a doctor may work as well as years in AA.
- The treatment industry could be affected if AA is proven to be an ineffective treatment for alcoholism.
- The author suggests that the Sinclair Method may be a more effective treatment for alcoholism.

Key learnings:
- AA attendance is not necessarily correlated with successful recovery from alcoholism.
- Longitudinal studies are almost useless in determining the effectiveness of AA.
- Randomized controlled trials provide mixed results for the efficacy of AA.
- The population being studied affects the outcomes of studies on AA.
- AA may not be a good fit for individuals who do not feel a personal connection to the project of quitting alcohol.
- The efficacy of different alcoholism treatment methods is difficult to determine due to a lack of control groups, mixed evidence, and differences in methodology
- Brief opportunistic interventions show promise as a minimal-effort, scalable treatment option for alcoholism
- Patient motivation and therapist authority may be important factors in the effectiveness of psychotherapy, rather than the type of psychotherapy itself
- AA may not be the most effective treatment for alcoholism.
- There are other treatment methods that may be more effective.
- The data supporting the efficacy of AA are weak and contradictory.

Key questions:
- How can the studies surrounding AA be improved to accurately determine its effectiveness?
- How can the politicization of addiction medicine be addressed to provide better care for patients?
- What factors can influence an individual's successful recovery from alcoholism?
- Are there other effective interventions for treating alcoholism besides AA?
- Are there more effective treatment methods that haven't been studied yet?
- How can we determine the effectiveness of a treatment method without using a control group?
- What factors beyond the specific type of psychotherapy impact its effectiveness?
- Is the Alcoholics Anonymous 12-step program really an effective treatment for alcoholism?
- If AA is not an effective treatment, what other options are available?
- What impact would it have on the treatment industry, society, and the "War on Drugs" if AA were proven to be ineffective?

# All In All, Another Brick In The Motte
*November 3, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/03/all-in-all-another-brick-in-the-motte/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The motte-and-bailey doctrine is a fallacy where a person makes a bold, controversial statement and then retreats to an obvious, uncontroversial statement when challenged, before returning to the bold statement.
- Shackel's paper criticizes post-modernism and compares the doctrine to a medieval castle.
- Examples of motte-and-bailey include religious groups, pseudoscience proponents, and some feminists.

Key learnings
- The motte-and-bailey doctrine draws its strength from people's failure to debate specific propositions rather than vague clouds of ideas.
- Weak-manning is a lot like straw-manning, except that instead of debating a fake, implausibly stupid opponent, you're debating a real, unrepresentatively stupid opponent.
- Tabooing words, then replacing the symbol with the substance can help with understanding what is actually being debated.

Key questions
- What is the real feminism we should be debating?
- Who thinks it would be a good idea to associate a vague, poorly-defined concept like feminism with positive or negative affect?
- How can we avoid falling prey to the motte-and-bailey doctrine in our own arguments and discussion?

# Ethnic Tension And Meaningless Arguments
*November 4, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/04/ethnic-tension-and-meaningless-arguments/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Motte-and-bailey is a successful fallacy that depends on people not being entirely clear on what they're arguing about.
- In Philosophy 101, arguments are supposed to be based on empirical fact, morality or policy.
- The Israel-Palestine conflict exemplifies how people can switch points in the middle of an argument due to the general factor of pro-Israeliness.
- The Ethnic Tension game demonstrates how emotivism can be used to manipulate vague concepts and load them with good or bad karma.
- Motte-and-bailey allows a vague concept to be defended by using a thing, like "religion is the belief that there's beauty and order in the universe," as a "motte" for a more controversial statement.
- The idea that connections or associations between different concepts or ideas can dictate our thoughts, opinions and attitudes towards certain issues, even if those connections are meaningless or illogical.
- The potential for a General Factor of Politics that influences our attitudes towards various political issues.
- The way in which political issues can be framed or politicized in various ways to influence people's opinions and attitudes towards them.
- The idea of drawing lines between concepts to assign them positive or negative karma.
- The social justice movement redefines words like "racism" to reflect bad karma toward opponents.
- Beliefs become weapons when they are joined to ethnic groups.
- The ability to form communities built on mutual disarmament and cooperation is essential.

Key learnings:
- Motte-and-bailey is a fallacy that can be used to manipulate people by exploiting their cognitive biases.
- Emotivism can be used to manipulate vague concepts and load them with good or bad karma.
- People can sometimes switch points in the middle of an argument due to the general factor of pro- or anti- a particular concept.
- It's important to be clear on the topic being debated to avoid the motte-and-bailey fallacy.
- Assigning good karma to a vague concept by pitching it persuasively can give it a massive "home field advantage" in any future debates.
- Our attitudes towards political issues can be heavily influenced by the connections or associations we make between different concepts or ideas.
- Political issues can be politicized and framed in different ways to elicit specific responses from people.
- There may be a General Factor of Politics that influences our attitudes towards a wide range of political issues.
- Concepts are often attached to different groups, creating proxy ethnicities that can lead to hatred and hostility.
- Forming rationalist communities is important for improving the quality of life and providing positive externalities to the outside world.
- Overcoming bias is hard, and members of rationalist communities need to be constantly trying to advance the art of discussion tactics.

Key questions:
- How can we avoid falling into the motte-and-bailey fallacy?
- How can we ensure that arguments are based on empirical fact, morality or policy?
- How can we stop people from manipulating vague concepts by exploiting people's cognitive biases?
- How can we encourage people to be more clear on the topic they are debating?
- How can we make sure that a concept is not given an unfair advantage due to good karma?
- How can we become more aware of the connections and associations we make between different concepts, and how they influence our attitudes towards political issues?
- How do different political narratives or frames influence our attitudes towards issues, and how can we distinguish between attempts to politicize an issue and attempts to provide a more nuanced understanding of it?
- Is it possible to overcome the influence of the General Factor of Politics on our attitudes towards political issues, and if so, how?
- How can people root out ethnic tension in particular communities?
- How can rationalist communities continue to advance the art of discussion tactics?
- In what ways can forming communities built on mutual disarmament and cooperation be beneficial for society?

# How To Use 23andMe Irresponsibly
*November 12, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/12/how-to-use-23andme-irresponsibly/

## Summary
Key ideas
- 23andMe was banned by the FDA from claiming to be able to predict personal outcomes from genes
- 23andMe users can browse their raw data to find gene or SNP that they are interested in
- SNPedia is a wiki collection of different SNPs that can provide users with relevant SNPs
- Genetics studies have limited scope and often fail to replicate themselves
- The author lists some genes, such as the warrior gene, the cuddle hormone gene, and the divorce gene that they think are fun to look up

Key learnings
- 23andMe allows users to browse their raw data to find SNPs in their genes
- The interpretation of the results requires additional research and should not be taken at face value

Key questions
- Which genes relate to violent tendencies?
- What is the oxytocin receptor and how does it affect social behavior?
- What is the orchid gene and how does it affect childhood development?

# The Dark Side Of Divorce
*November 14, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/14/the-dark-side-of-divorce/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The Nurture Assumption by Judith Rich Harris argues that genetics completely trump parenting, pointing out that parenting studies often neglect possible genetic contributions.
- Studies have shown that children of divorce have worse outcomes than children of intact two-parent families, but the cause is usually due to stressful family conflict, not the lack of having two parents or economic trouble.
- Studies have investigated the genetic explanation of divorce and found that the negative effects of divorce are mostly limited to the group whose parents got divorced when they were alive due to the environmental stress from the divorce.
- The Nurture Assumption never denies that shared environment can affect outcomes during childhood, although less than one might expect.
- The short-term effects of divorce are robust and environmental, but the long-term effects of divorce are spurious and/or genetic.

Key learnings:
- Parenting is less important in determining outcomes than genetics and non-shared environment.
- The negative effects of divorce are mostly due to stressful family conflict.
- The short-term effects of divorce are robust and environmental, and the long-term effects of divorce are spurious and/or genetic.

Key questions:
- Is the stress of divorce and family conflict always a negative influence? Do some children benefit from escaping stressful environments?
- How can genetics be incorporated into parenting strategies to better address the genetic contributions to outcomes?
- Are there ways to mitigate the negative effects of divorce on children, or is it an inevitable consequence of family conflict?

# The Categories Were Made For Man, Not Man For The Categories
*November 21, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/21/the-categories-were-made-for-man-not-man-for-the-categories/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The argument that Biblical fallibility can be proved through the misidentification of whales as fish is misguided.
- The categorization of objects, such as planets or mammals, is not always clear-cut and can be based on arbitrary decisions.
- Borders between countries can be subjective and based on trade-offs rather than clear-cut facts.
- Boundaries can be subjective and negotiable, not factually correct or incorrect.
- Criteria for categorization can be defined arbitrarily but with tradeoffs in mind.
- The transgender movement proposes self-identification as a tiebreaker between man and woman.
- The project of the transgender movement is a boundary-redrawing project that aims to save lives.
- A psychiatrist's primary focus is to help the patient, whatever the means.
- Scott argues for the importance of clear definitions.
- He discusses how unclear definitions can lead to confusion and manipulative rhetoric.
- Scott provides strategies for creating accurate and concise definitions.

Key learnings:
- Definitions of categories, such as what constitutes a fish, are not always based on concrete facts but can be influenced by cultural and linguistic factors.
- The categorization of objects can be based on arbitrary decisions rather than clear-cut definitions, leading to disagreements among different groups.
- Borders between countries can be subjective and based on trade-offs, leading to peculiar situations like territories within other territories.
- Categorization is subjective.
- Boundaries can be somewhat arbitrary but serve a purpose.
- Psychiatry is about helping patients.
- Creating clear definitions takes effort and attention.
- Accurate definitions limit the potential for manipulation and confusion.
- Defining terms is crucial for productive communication.

Key questions:
- How do cultural and linguistic factors influence the definitions of categories like fish or mammals?
- How can we make decisions on categorization when there is no clear-cut definition?
- How can we balance the trade-offs involved in border disputes to create a solution that satisfies both sides?
- Is it morally sound to redraw boundaries for a specific purpose?
- Where do we draw the line between arbitrary and concrete boundaries?
- In what instances is it necessary or justifiable to redraw boundaries?
- How can we ensure that our definitions accurately reflect the territory?
- What strategies can we use to create concise and accurate definitions?
- How do unclear definitions contribute to deceptive rhetoric and confusion?

# Prisons Are Built With Bricks Of Law And Brothels With Bricks Of Religion, But That Doesn’t Prove A Causal Relationship
*November 21, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/21/prisons-are-built-with-bricks-of-law-and-brothels-with-bricks-of-religion-but-that-doesnt-prove-a-causal-relationship/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- A study found that those who receive psychiatric treatment are more likely to commit suicide than those who don't, but this does not necessarily establish a causative relationship.
- The increased risk of suicide among those who receive psychiatric treatment could be due to selection because those who are more severely at risk of dying from suicide are also more likely to seek such treatment.
- There is no evidence to support the hypothesis that suicide is a progressive illness or that people with suicidal feelings travel on a trajectory of ever-intensifying, ever-more-constant suicidal feelings while getting into ever more intensive psychiatric care until they die at steadily increasing rates along the way.
- The link between murder and previous contact with the police is strong, dose-dependent and has a plausible causal mechanism.

Key learnings:
- The association between psychiatric care and suicide was already known, and the study did not provide new insights on how much of that association is causal, how much is selection and how much is another factor.
- Forced commitment can sometimes be harmful, and the weighing of the costs and benefits is something that hasn't been investigated nearly as much as it deserves.

Key questions:
- Were perfectly healthy people with no psychiatric problems used as a control group in the study, and why?
- Why should we privilege the hypothesis over the alternative possibility, that suicidal people are more likely to seek or get forced into psychiatric treatment?
- Is there any evidence supporting the hypothesis that suicide is a progressive illness or that people with suicidal feelings travel on a trajectory of ever-intensifying, ever-more-constant suicidal feelings while getting into ever more intensive psychiatric care until they die at steadily increasing rates along the way? 
- How much of the association between psychiatric care and suicide is causal, how much is selection, and how much is another factor?

# Race and Justice: Much More Than You Wanted To Know
*November 25, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/25/race-and-justice-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The author investigates whether the criminal justice system is fair to African-Americans.
- Studies show that police are more likely to stop and search black people.
- There is debate over whether the disparities in stop and search rates are due to racism or other factors.
- Black people are disproportionately arrested for violent crimes but crime victimization surveys suggest this is because black people are more likely to commit these crimes.
- There is controversy around the disparity in arrest rates for minor crimes, particularly drug offenses.
- Self-reported data on drug use may be unreliable.
- Studies show there is a strong racial bias in capital punishment and a moderate racial bias in sentence length and decisions to jail.
- There is ambiguity over the level of racial bias in police stops, police shootings in certain jurisdictions, and arrests for minor drug offenses.
- There seems to be little or no racial bias in arrests for serious violent crimes, police shootings in most jurisdictions, prosecutions, or convictions.

Key learnings:
- The issue of racial disparities in the criminal justice system is complex and difficult to disentangle.
- Only some studies have found that racial bias is responsible for disparities in stop and search rates.
- Arrests for violent crimes are probably not racially biased.
- There is controversy over the disparity in arrest rates for minor crimes, particularly drug offenses.
- Self-reported data on drug use may be unreliable.
- The actual level of bias is limited and detectable only through statistical aggregation of hundreds or thousands of cases and is only unambiguously present in sentencing, and there only at a level of 10-20%, and that only if you believe the most damning studies.
- The justice system is not disproportionately harming blacks, but there are still many ways it can indirectly harm blacks without being explicitly racist.

Key questions:
- Are police officers more likely to stop and search black people due to racial bias or other factors?
- What factors are responsible for the disparity in arrest rates for minor crimes between black and white people?
- Is self-reported data on drug use reliable and, if not, what methods could be used instead to gather more accurate data?
- Why are there conflicting studies on racial bias in the justice system?
- In what ways can the justice system indirectly harm black people without being explicitly racist?
- How can the justice system be improved to address racial bias and disparities?

# Why I Am Not Rene Descartes
*November 27, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/27/why-i-am-not-rene-descartes/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The author rejects the idea of rationalism and promotes empiricism as a more valuable approach.
- Rationalism is individualistic and does not promote collaboration, unlike scholarship and science.
- The author argues that rationalists make naive errors and rely on limited source material when engaging in social or political theorizing.
- The Twelve Virtues of Rationality, a founding document of internet rationalism, emphasizes the importance of empiricism, scholarship, and humility.
- Rationality is about drawing correct inferences from limited, confusing, contradictory, or maliciously doctored facts
- Empiricism is useful, but equally, it's useful to be able to use a limited amount of evidence wisely
- Rationality allows individuals to decide their beliefs accurately, especially in areas where limited or contradicting evidence exist

Key learnings:
- Empiricism is a more valuable approach than rationalism because it relies on data rather than intuition and common sense.
- Collaboration and building on the work of others is more important than individualism.
- Scholarship and science emphasize empiricism and collaboration, while rationalism emphasizes individualism.
- Empiricism and rationality are both essential, but the latter is more crucial in understanding limited evidence accurately
- Only rational individuals can draw accurate conclusions from limited, confusing, and contradictory facts
- Studies can be misleading, and it's important to verify methodologies, failure modes, and biases before believing them

Key questions:
- Why do some atheists promote rationalism over empiricism?
- Why do rationalists make naive errors and rely on limited source material when engaging in social or political theorizing?
- How can rationalists balance the importance of individualism with collaboration in order to improve their approach?
- What are the differences between rationality and empiricism, and which is more crucial in understanding limited evidence?
- Can limited evidence always be interpreted correctly with rationality, or are there any exceptions?
- How important are rationality and empiricism as individual skills in decision-making?

# Book Review: On The Road
*December 2, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/02/book-review-on-the-road/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- On the Road is about terrible people doing terrible things.
- The characters drive across the US without a particular reason, getting in car accidents, stealing stuff, and screwing women whom they promise to marry and then don’t.
- The characters are visionaries who use overwrought religious adjectives to describe every object they come across.
- "On The Road" by Jack Kerouac features a high-trust society that is collapsing.
- Kerouac's philosophy advocates for living without compromise, seeking holiness and the exotic.
- The book describes characters who engage in pointless criminality while pursuing transcendence.
- The early Communists' ideology and Kerouac's philosophy both share similar shortcomings.
- The book lacks self-awareness and shows poor judgment in its depiction of mysticism, travel, and relationships.

Key learnings:
- The characters in On the Road are desperately trying to avoid getting a stable life, including stable relationships and steady jobs.
- The characters are incredibly fortunate in their ability to obtain jobs easily and to travel without much consequence.
- The novel unintentionally highlights the cultural shift that has occurred to protect women from predatory behavior.
- The collapse of a high-trust society is inevitable when people defect against one another.
- Pursuing a life of self-indulgence and rejecting social norms will likely lead to negative consequences.
- Utopia is not something that arises automatically; it requires effort and active participation from individuals.
- Pursuing mysticism and transcendence should be done in moderation and under careful guidance.

Key questions:
- How do the characters avoid getting caught for their criminal deeds so easily?
- Why is Kerouac obsessed with Dean Moriarty despite all of his bad deeds?
- Is there any value to be found in the characters’ constant search for enlightenment and revelation, or is it all just a meaningless pursuit of intense emotion?
- Can a book's characters' viewpoints differ significantly from the author's viewpoint?
- How much value is there in living a life without compromise?
- Can pleasure-seeking activities like travel and sex be enjoyed responsibly?
- What is the relationship between spiritual growth and enlightenment?

# Framing For Light Instead Of Heat
*December 3, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/03/framing-for-light-instead-of-heat/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The blog post discusses how terminology matters in discussions of bias and discrimination in the criminal justice system and in the gender wage gap.
- The author argues that the standard methodology of controlling for factors like income level may miss direct bias against black people caused by racist attitudes among police and other officials.
- The author suggests that tackling the culture of bribery, nepotism, and corruption is a more appropriate solution to address bias in the criminal justice system.
- The author also argues that the focus on the gender wage gap often ignores upstream factors like how men and women are socialized as children to have different values.
- The author shares a specific structure to follow when writing blog posts.
- The structure consists of six parts: headline, hook, context, key ideas, key learnings, and key questions.
- The key ideas should provide a summary of the main points that will be discussed in the post.

Key learnings:
- The post highlights the importance of careful definition and use of terminology in discussions of issues related to bias and discrimination.
- It emphasizes the need to consider and address upstream factors that contribute to the gender wage gap.
- It highlights the idea that the solution to bias and discrimination in the criminal justice system may need to focus on broader social and economic issues, rather than just addressing individual attitudes or behavior.
- A well-structured blog post can help readers better understand the content.
- Following a consistent structure takes the guesswork out of writing.
- Including key ideas, key learnings, and key questions can make a blog post more engaging and thought-provoking.

Key questions:
- What is the impact of using imprecise or misleading terminology in discussions of bias and discrimination?
- How can we effectively tackle issues like bias in the criminal justice system and the gender wage gap?
- What are the broader social and economic factors that contribute to bias and discrimination, and how can we address them?
- "Does my headline accurately represent the content of the post?"
- "Is my hook interesting and compelling?"
- "Have I provided enough context for readers who may be unfamiliar with the topic?"
- "What are the main points I want readers to take away from this post?"
- "What new insights or lessons have I learned from researching and writing this post?"

- The space shuttle was not feasible for space exploration and set back future space exploration.
- China bans puns to repress dissent and control culture.
- A study shows that summer jobs lower violent crime among disadvantaged youth.
- Nootropics become a valid source for innovative gaming and performance enhancers.
- Several government programs for low-income citizens failed, according to research.
- The Conservative Case for reforming the police.
- Superheroes are used as a means of escaping the real consequences of sci-fi wonders.

- Superheroes allow people's minds to escape consequences, rather than to engage and initiate real-life change.
- The minimum wage's effect on employment is still controversial.
 
Key questions:
- Are dating sites for extremist groups a concerning and increasing trend?
- Does omega-3 research rely too much on studies that contradict other studies?
- Did the space shuttle's design flaws ultimately hinder space exploration?
- Is there any evidence that puns pose a threat to Chinese culture and social control?

# Beware The Man Of One Study
*December 12, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/12/beware-the-man-of-one-study/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Even in medical research, where experimental rigor is high, there will always be noise and variation, resulting in a bell curve of results.
- Medical science is still healthy overall, but there are still issues with bias and experimental design.
- In politics, there is much less protection against these issues, resulting in conflicting studies and meta-analyses.
- People often use lists of studies and experts to support their arguments, but these can still be misleading.
- Structure is essential in writing.
- Avoid going off-topic or adding unnecessary details.
- Consider the audience and purpose of the writing.
- Be aware of bias and always fact-check.

Key learnings:
- Beware the man of one study: a comprehensive and unbiased survey of research is necessary to draw meaningful conclusions.
- Skepticism is important, but radical skepticism can be counterproductive.
- Even meta-analyses and systematic reviews have limitations and can be biased.
- Clear structure can improve the effectiveness of writing.
- Writing should always match the purpose and audience.
- Avoiding bias and fact-checking are essential for credibility.
- Detail can detract from the main message.

Key questions:
- How can we ensure that studies are free from bias and experimental design issues?
- Can we trust news sources and institutions to accurately summarize complex research findings?
- How can we encourage people to think critically about lists of studies and experts that are used to support arguments?
- Is the writing organized and structured?
- Who is the intended audience and purpose?
- Is bias affecting the message?
- Are all details necessary for the overall message?

# Debunked And Well-Refuted
*December 13, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/13/debunked-and-well-refuted/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The Federalist released a report on sexual assault rates on campuses that disputes the "one in five" statistic and argues that non-students are more likely to be victims of sexual assault than students.
- The author argues that one cannot directly compare per year sexual assault rates to per college career sexual assault rates.
- Confirmation bias occurs not only when people believe every study that supports their views, but also when people believe every supposed refutation that supports their views.
- Saying that a study has been "debunked" or "refuted" often appeals to authority and shuts out evidence that challenges beliefs.
- The discrepancy between different campus rape surveys is due partly to response bias and partly to different definitions of "sexual assault".

Key learnings:
- Academics can be just as divided as anyone else on issues, and their arguments can be just as acrimonious as anyone else's.
- Every study has flaws and no study has perfect methodology.
- One should be cautious about accepting arguments from authority or selectively acknowledging studies that support one's own views.
- Different studies that contradict each other may be valid depending on how they define their terms.

Key questions:
- What are some examples of things that have been "well-refuted" and "debunked"?
- When is it appropriate to claim that a study has been debunked or refuted?
- How does confirmation bias function in academia, and what does this mean for the validity of research?

# The Toxoplasma Of Rage
*December 17, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- PETA creates attention through controversial publicity stunts, but at the cost of its credibility
- Highly publicized rape cases that turn out to be false can harm the credibility of the larger movement to believe victims
- People use moral decisions to signal how moral they are, even if that means supporting disastrous decisions based on obscure moral principles
- The more controversial a case, the more attention it garners, even if there are other cases that are equally deserving of attention
- Controversial campaigns often backfire by polarizing people and creating opposition
- Bloggers tend to write more about controversial topics as they generate more page views compared to uncontroversial ones
- The structures of different online communities can facilitate the spread of outrage-inducing memes, leading to the proliferation of specific and often polarizing views
- Any complex multi-person system acts according to its own chaotic incentives that don’t necessarily correspond to what any individual within the system wants.
- Emergent uncoordinated process can lead to the rise and prominence of some topics while others are relegated.
- There is a need for coordination to address issues such as racist police brutality.
- Moloch, the abstracted spirit of discoordination and flailing response to incentives will publicize whatever he wants.

Key learnings:
- Attention and credibility can be at odds with each other, and attention through controversy can come at a high cost
- Signal value can sometimes be a poor basis for moral decision-making
- Publicizing controversial cases can be harmful to victim advocacy if those cases turn out to be false
- Activists should be cautious in choosing their battles and try to pick settled cases that are unlikely to polarize people excessively
- Bloggers should be aware of the tradeoff between page views and social responsibility and strive to balance both
- The design of online communities can have a profound impact on the spread of ideas and memes, particularly if outrage is a common currency
- The media has a responsibility for covering issues that affect society.
- Charitable acts do not sell.
- Moloch is the enemy of press freedom and unity.
- Memetic evolution creates a machine optimized to search the world for the most controversial and counterproductive issues, then make sure no one can talk about anything else.

Key questions:
- How can advocacy movements balance the need for attention with the need for credibility?
- How can people distinguish between signal value and actual moral principles when making decisions?
- How can the media responsibly cover controversial cases without causing harm to advocacy movements or victim credibility?
- How can we strike a balance between writing about things that matter and things that generate page views?
- Can online communities be designed in a way that promotes civility and fosters constructive dialogues?
- How can social media platforms prevent the spread of toxic and polarizing memes?
- How can society address issues such as racist police brutality?
- What is the role of the media in the promotion of societal issues?
- Can charities be sold in the media?
- Why is Moloch against unity?

# Nobody Is Perfect, Everything Is Commensurable
*December 19, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/19/nobody-is-perfect-everything-is-commensurable/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- It is a 'bummer' that progressivism is often uncomfortable and requires people to confront brutal injustices.
- There is a debate around the obligation to get involved in politics as a way of improving the world.
- There are arguments for and against engaging in politics, and also for and against donating to charity.
- Donating to charity is argued to be more effective than political activism.
- Charitable donation is deliberately throwing the power of your brain and muscle behind the cause.
- Giving 10% per year is a good standard to live up to for being a good person who gives back to society.
- Everything is commensurable, and we can fulfill obligations in multiple equivalent ways.

Key learnings:
- Engaging in political activism is uncomfortable, but necessary for progressivism.
- While politics and charity are both important, the latter is more effective for creating change.
- Having less than 100% obligation gives you the opportunity to budget and trade-off.
- You can fulfill obligations by donating money, volunteering, or activism.
- Aiming for an impossible goal and feeling short isn't helpful; setting an achievable goal encourages more people to do as much as possible.

Key questions:
- Should people prioritize engaging in politics or donating to charity when trying to improve the world?
- Is it fair to feel self-loathing for not being able to do everything to improve the world?
- Can individuals be doing enough to help others without engaging in political activism?
- If I want to be a good person who gives back to the community, but I am triggered by politics, what do I do?
- How effectively can a charitable donation solve world poverty and disease?
- What better way to fight back against the capture of our financial resources by the undirected dance of incentives other than charitable donations?

# There Are Rules Here
*December 24, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/24/there-are-rules-here/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Conservative Protestantism is thriving while liberal Protestantism is dying.
- Arbitrary demands and restrictions in conservative religious groups can make them stronger.
- Demanding rituals serve as hard-to-fake symbols of commitment that keep only the most committed members in the group.
- Liberal Protestant churches often end up having a lot of half-committed believers in their pews, which weakens the community.

Key learnings:
- Churches that demand real sacrifice of their members are stronger because they have built-in tools to eliminate people with weaker commitments.
- Members of religious communities that follow demanding rituals and onerous requirements are more caring and generous with each other.

Key questions:
- Why are liberal Protestant churches failing while conservative ones are thriving?
- Why do demanding rituals and rules serve as hard-to-fake symbols of commitment?
- Why are there no effective atheist religion-substitutes that have strict rules or requirements for their members?

# Book Review: What’s Wrong With The World
*December 25, 2014*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/25/book-review-whats-wrong-with-the-world/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- G.K. Chesterton's 1910 collection, What's Wrong With The World, focuses on societal problems caused by the Industrial Revolution
- Chesterton's style is to challenge common-sense assertions and take an opposing view
- Chesterton argues against the progressive solution to social problems: altering human nature to fit the conditions instead of changing the conditions to fit human nature
- He proposes a return to medieval values, and issues with the church and Christianity failing because they were not lived enough
- Chesterton's solution to societal problems is to roll things back to the way they were before the Industrial Revolution.
- Chesterton's proposals are impossible to implement within the current political sphere.
- The author argues that sometimes medication is the only effective way to treat depression.
- The author disagrees with Chesterton's utopian view of the world.

Key learnings:
- Chesterton's writing style involves taking the opposite view to challenge common-sense assumptions
- The book argues for a return to medieval values
- Changing society to solve societal problems isn't easy, and sometimes medication is the best option.
- Sometimes people have unrealistic solutions to societal problems.

Key questions:
- What is the difference between Chesterton's idea of "trying Christianity" and actually implementing it?
- How relevant are Chesterton's arguments to modern society and political climate?
- How does the author propose to solve societal problems that cannot be solved by medication?
- Is it ethical to put people on medication instead of trying to fix the root cause of their problems?
- How can society realistically address societal problems without rolling everything back to a previous era?

# Untitled
*January 1, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/01/untitled/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The author discusses the controversy surrounding Scott Aaronson's admission of struggling with his sexuality and suicidal thoughts, and the negative response he received from some feminists.
- The author argues that some feminists engage in "nerd-baiting" and use weaponized shame against shy or awkward men.
- The author suggests that this is not just a gendered issue, as she has experienced similar feelings and struggles.
- Scott discusses the issue of nerd-shaming and its effects on males, particularly those in STEM fields.
- He argues that feminists often do not take this issue seriously and may even contribute to the problem, despite being eagle-eyed at spotting seemingly innocuous messages in culture that reinforce negative gender roles for women.
- Scott suggests that self-loathing can be easy to inculcate and encourage, and that the market failure of young men preferring to castrate themselves rather than ask someone out must have a weird explanation.
- He argues that patriarchy is a motte and bailey trick, and that feminists can sometimes be the ones propping it up in any given situation.
- The article discusses the issue of whether nerdy men are among the least privileged men.
- The author argues the point that nerdy men experience different kinds of suffering than women, but that doesn't mean it isn't real.
- The article points out the flaw in using a one-dimensional view of privilege vs. oppression.
- Scott shares his thoughts on the unhealthy structure society uses to marginalize nerds.
- The author discusses the use of the "Empire" metaphor by different groups such as trans-exclusionary radical feminists, men's rights activists, and male nerds.
- The author argues that this is a result of the one-dimensional model of privilege, where suffering is denied to individuals who are considered privileged.
- The author also examines the claim made by feminists who argue that women are excluded from the life of the mind due to structural misogyny, and counters these arguments with statistics on the high percentage of women in various fields.
- The gender disparity in certain STEM fields is the result of gene-culture interaction, not the behavior of "creepy nerds."
- Feminists and "nerds" both want to solve the problem of loneliness and confusion in romantic and sexual relationships.
- The author challenges claims that nerds have an entitled, sexist or violent attitudes, arguing that these claims ignore empirical evidence about nerds' behavior and beliefs.
- Scott Aaronson writes about his experiences as a nerdy man in the feminist community, including feeling alienated and suicidal due to the pressure to conform to feminist beliefs.
- Aaronson argues that feminists often shame and bully nerds, contributing to their feelings of isolation and depression.
- Aaronson emphasizes the need for empathy and understanding on both sides, advocating for cooperation and mutual respect.

Key learnings:
- Feminism can be a complex and divisive topic, and there are differing views on how to approach it.
- Fear of rejection and social anxiety can be difficult experiences for anyone to endure, not just men or women.
- It is important to consider how our actions and words may affect others, and to strive for empathy and understanding.
- Feminist shaming can make adolescence and current life miserable for shy, awkward, and vulnerable nerdy men and women who have internalized feminist messages.
- Feminists can be either against or in favor of patriarchy broadly defined, and it is important to ask the people involved to figure out how many feminists are among the people twisting the knife.
- Structural oppression should be about the structure.
- There's danger in belittling socially excluded groups.
- One-dimensional views of privilege vs. oppression can be flawed.
- The use of the "Empire" metaphor is often employed to discredit those who challenge existing power dynamics and to avoid addressing issues of structural misogyny and gender inequality.
- Critics of the one-dimensional model of privilege call for a more nuanced understanding of oppression that takes into account intersectionality and the ways in which privilege operates in different contexts.
- The author argues that the underrepresentation of women in tech and engineering fields is not due to Silicon Valley misogyny but rather is shaped by a range of factors that are established long before women even enter those fields, including cultural and social biases.
- Gender disparity in certain fields is the result of society's role stereotypes that magnify small, innate differences.
- Feminism and the "nerd" community share some goals in promoting more fulfilling romantic and sexual relationships.
- Stereotypes about entitled, sexist or violent "nerds" are unfounded and contribute to the exclusion of men in STEM fields.
- The article highlights the complexity of identity and the ways in which different forms of oppression can interact and compound each other.
- The article also underscores the importance of individual experiences and the need to take them seriously, regardless of whether they conform to a particular narrative or ideology.

Key questions:
- How can we encourage more productive and respectful discussions around feminism and related issues?
- Is it possible to bridge the divide between different perspectives on this topic?
- What steps can individuals take to combat weaponized shame and other negative behaviors in feminist discourse?
- What are the potential negative consequences of emphasizing narratives about objectification and entitlement in feminist activism?
- Is there a way to do activism that does not exacerbate crippling guilt and self-loathing for vulnerable people, particularly those with mental illness or disabilities?
- How can we better address the issue of nerd-shaming and its effects on young men in STEM fields?
- What is structural oppression?
- Can nerdiness be considered as structural oppression?
- How can we avoid minimizing one person's pain and suffering as opposed to another's?
- How can we move beyond simplistic models of privilege in order to better understand the complexities of oppression and inequality?
- How can we address gender inequality in fields where women are underrepresented without resorting to blaming and shaming tactics?
- How can we raise awareness and challenge the pervasive biases and stereotypes that shape our cultural perceptions of what fields women are "supposed" to be interested in?
- Why does Penny encourage women to "own their emotions, lust, and fear" but encourages men to "let go of their resentment"?
- How does the concept of scrupulosity impact the perception of nerds?
- Why are nerds blamed for gender disparity in STEM fields and how can this stereotype be harmful to men in STEM?
- How can we create a more inclusive and supportive feminist movement that takes into account the experiences of all individuals, including nerdy men?
- How can we balance the need for open, honest discussion with the need to respect each other's boundaries and trauma?
- How can we work to reduce feelings of isolation and loneliness among marginalized groups, including nerds and feminists?

# Ethics Offsets
*January 4, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/04/ethics-offsets/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Voluntary carbon offsets and ethics offsets allow individuals to engage in actions they feel conflicted about by making a payment that offsets negative actions
- Donating to charity instead of engaging in activism can be seen as a type of ethics offset
- Giving money to charity as an ethics offset is generally considered acceptable
- The ethical appropriateness of donating to animal rights charities while continuing to consume animal products is debatable
- Its ethical appropriateness to donate money to a group convincing people to become vegetarian while continuing to eat meat is also debatable
- Donating money to global health causes as an offset to being responsible for someone's death is ethically problematic but can be argued for

Key learnings
- Ethics offsets allow individuals to engage in actions they feel conflicted about by offsetting the negative impact of their actions through a payment
- Donating to charity can be viewed as a form of ethics offsetting
- The ethical appropriateness of using offsets to justify actions that conflict with individual moral values is debatable
- The universalizability of ethics offsetting is an important factor to consider

Key questions
- Is it ethical to use a donation to justify actions that go against individual moral values?
- How much does the advertising price to convert someone to vegetarianism justify continuing to eat meat?

# Chronic Psychitis
*January 5, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/05/chronic-psychitis/

## Summary
Key ideas

- Inflammation caused by cytokines released by immune cells is linked to "sickness behavior," which resembles depression-like symptoms.
- Good diet, exercise, and sleep reduce inflammation and improve depression.
- Cortisol, released by the hypothalamopituitaryadrenocortical axis, downregulates the immune system and decreases inflammatory cytokine action.
- Anti-inflammatory drugs like aspirin and celecoxib show promise in treating depression, but more research is needed.
- Theories of how depression starts, whether from inflammation or other causes, are still widely sought.

Key learnings

- Depression and inflammation are closely related.
- There is evidence that inflammation caused by illness triggers depression.
- Anti-inflammatory drugs can improve depression, but they pose some health risks.

Key questions

- Can antidepressants work by reducing inflammation, and is the serotonin theory a red herring?
- What links depression to diseases like cancer, rheumatoid arthritis or diabetes, and to chemicals called cytokines?
- Can depression be treated by giving people anti-inflammatory drugs, and what potential risks or side effects might this present?

# Links 1/2015: An Extraordinary URL In An Ordinary World
*January 6, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/06/links-12015-an-extraordinary-url-in-an-ordinary-world/

## Summary
Key ideas
- North Korea’s official Twitter account only follows one active user, a twenty-something Texan investor, and he has no idea why
- Giving people better health insurance didn’t necessarily make them healthier, as shown by the RAND insurance experiment and the more recent Oregon experiment
- Female journalist disguised herself as a man and went undercover to study sex roles, concluding that men are suffering
- The Man Who Called Gandhi A Sissy – pretty interesting Economist article on Vinayak Savarkar, the founder of modern Hindu nationalism
- Japan’s Sexual Apathy Is Endangering The Global Economy

Key learnings
- Often, the results of an experiment support whatever the commentator involved originally believed
- The academic system works by having each field focus on one view and then opposing views branch off by pretending to be different fields
- The failures of conventional nutrition science had killed millions of people
- Brown adipose tissue, a form of fat that burns energy, is probably the closest equivalent to the popular notion of “some people just have high metabolism and won’t get fat no matter how bad their diet is”
- Mirabegron, an FDA-approved drug, may be a promising treatment for metabolic disease

Key questions
- How do we know the gender gap in economics is not primarily due to sexism?
- Are there any men who tried what female journalist Norah Vincent did, which is to disguise themselves as a member of the opposite sex?

# The Phatic And The Anti-Inductive
*January 11, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/11/the-phatic-and-the-anti-inductive/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Phatic communication refers to talking for the sake of talking to acknowledge acquaintances and maintain social relationships
- Anti-inductive institutions or systems are those that become more complex and difficult to exploit when patterns are discovered, such as the stock market and job-seeking
- Supportive therapy can be phatic or anti-inductive depending on the patient and therapist's communication preferences
- Appreciating the phatic can be beneficial for maintaining social relationships and acknowledging gratitude

Key learnings:
- Phatic communication and anti-inductive institutions are important concepts to consider when understanding various systems and interactions
- Therapy can be improved by recognizing when to use phatic or anti-inductive communication based on the patient's needs and preferences
- Appreciating the importance of phatic communication can help maintain social relationships and show gratitude

Key questions:
- How can individuals identify whether they or others prefer phatic or anti-inductive communication?
- Are there any other examples of anti-inductive systems or institutions besides the stock market?
- How can therapists determine whether to utilize phatic or anti-inductive approaches during supportive therapy sessions?

# The Physics Diet?
*January 12, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/12/the-physics-diet/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- There are multiple positions on the thermodynamics of weight gain.
- Genetics and medications can have an effect on weight gain.
- The most interesting debate is between the idea that basal metabolism is also involved in weight gain versus the idea that all of the interventions known to affect weight do it by affecting appetite and exercise drive.

Key learnings:
- Weight gain is not solely determined by calories in versus calories out.
- Medications, genetics, and microbial makeup can have an impact on weight gain.
- There is a debate on whether basal metabolism affects weight gain versus affecting appetite and exercise drive.

Key questions:
- Do genetics and microbial makeup disproportionately affect some people in an obesogenic environment?
- Can individual people's metabolism change drastically and unexpectedly, and can green tea and other methods actually affect weight loss on a meaningful level?

# The Influenza Of Evil
*January 13, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/13/evil-is-anti-inductive/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The author discusses the concept of anti-induction and how it applies to detecting patterns in humor, evil, and society's response to it.
- The author argues that bullies find ways to mock certain groups that are still socially acceptable under the guise of punching up instead of punching down.
- The author suggests that pointing out these instances of bullying will eventually make it unacceptable and force bullies to find new targets.

Key learnings:
- Anti-induction is a phenomenon where detecting a pattern can cause it to disappear, making it challenging to predict future events.
- Society has arbitrary exceptions to the "punching down" rule in comedy and bullying.
- Pointing out instances of bullying and mocking can eventually lead to a shift in societal attitudes.

Key questions:
- How do we know when it's acceptable to mock someone or something in comedy?
- How can we detect when we're punching down instead of punching up?
- What role do memes and cultural associations play in forming our societal attitudes toward different groups?

- Depression is not the same as being sad and can be caused by various factors, including genetics, light, and diet.
- Suicide rates are highest in happier areas according to a study by Daly, Oswald, and Wu.

Key learnings:
- Depression and suicide rates can be affected by various factors, making it difficult to compare societies.

# Perceptions Of Required Ability Act As A Proxy For Actual Required Ability In Explaining The Gender Gap
*January 24, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/24/perceptions-of-required-ability-act-as-a-proxy-for-actual-required-ability-in-explaining-the-gender-gap/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Leslie et al (2015) concluded that women are underrepresented in fields that believe innate talent is the main requirement for success.
- Many media outlets have taken this conclusion and made a theory that negative stereotypes of women cause stress that depresses the immune system.
- However, the paper did not investigate whether perceived or actual required ability correlated more.
- The author found that there was no effect of GRE scores on female representation, but a correlation of r = -0.82 between average GRE Quantitative score and percent women in a discipline.
- Colleges accepting applicants based entirely on GRE scores would significantly limit female representation in STEM fields.
- Part II of Leslie et al paper asserts gender gap in STEM fields is due to innate ability differences
- The paper uses proxies for innate ability, such as GRE scores, instead of measuring it directly
- The correlation between innate ability and gender balance predicted by Leslie et al is actually mostly mediated by gender stereotypes

Key learnings:
- The media often misconstrues research papers, creating a theory that is not supported by the study’s methodology.
- Correlation is not causation, but in this case, the observed correlation seemingly leaves no room for explained variance.
- Gender-based patterns in academia are significantly impacted by mathematical ability, with GRE Quantitative scores showing strong male-female gaps in representation.
- The traditional belief that innate talent is more important than hard work and effort may perpetuate gender-based stereotypes.
- The Leslie et al paper's argument is flawed due to its use of proxies for innate ability and ignoring important existing literature on the topic
- SAT and GRE math tests are not reflective of women’s true mathematical ability
- Reverse causation cannot explain the gender gap in STEM fields

Key questions:
- Do negative stereotypes globally impact performance in various academic fields?
- Should colleges rely on a single standardized test like the GRE for graduate school admission?
- How can we create a more inclusive learning environment that emphasizes the importance of hard work and effort rather than innate talent?
- Is the stereotype threat literature a null field that only exists through publication bias and experimenter effects?
- How can the correlation between innate ability and gender balance be measured more accurately?

# The Parable Of The Talents
*January 31, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/31/the-parable-of-the-talents/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- IQ is 50-80% heritable and crucial for success in certain fields.
- Depression, obesity, and poverty are often viewed as biological/innate, but intelligence is seen as something that can be improved through effort.
- The author believes in the consistent view that success in any field is determined by genes, biology, and accidents of birth.
- The author (Scott) reflects on the concept of innate ability and whether hard work and grit can make up for skill in certain areas.
- He discusses the dangers of high scrupulosity and how it affects the rationalist community's emphasis on heroic responsibility.
- Scott touches on the importance of decoupling perception of intelligence from self-worth and how not talking about ability differences won't help the situation.
- Pursue your comparative advantage, even if it might not seem "prestigious".
- You can still make a difference by donating money to important causes.
- The word "talent" comes from the parable of the three servants and implies using what God has given wisely.

Key learnings:
- Attributing outcomes to genes, biology, and accidents of birth is often seen as compassionate, while attributing outcomes to effort and willpower can stigmatize people.
- The author struggles with their own achievements in certain areas due to conflicting beliefs about innate ability.
- Work hard and grit may not be enough to make up for lack of innate ability in certain areas.
- High scrupulosity can lead to negative implications in the rationalist community.
- It is crucial to decouple perception of intelligence from self-worth to promote a healthy mindset.
- Use your resources wisely, no matter how few or plentiful they are.
- What others do with their lives should not be a basis for comparison.
- Innate abilities and differences exist; it's important to recognize and accept them.

Key questions:
- How can we reconcile the belief in innate ability with the desire for social justice?
- How does the attribution of success to effort vs. innate ability affect people's self-esteem and sense of worth?
- Should we continue to view intelligence as a trait that can be improved by effort, or is the genetic component too significant to ignore?
- Can hard work alone make up for the lack of innate ability in certain subjects, or is it a combination of both?
- How can the rationalist community promote healthy approaches to self-improvement without succumbing to high scrupulosity?
- How can we decouple perception of intelligence from self-worth to foster a healthier mindset, especially for those with cognitive difficulties?
- If innate ability is not a factor in one's success, how can we explain differences in outcomes?
- How can we balance pursuing our own interests with making a positive impact in the world?
- Can our innate abilities be developed or improved? How much of it is fixed?

# Talents Part 2: Attitude vs. Altitude
*February 1, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/02/01/talents-part-2-attitude-vs-altitude/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- One way to understand intelligence is to compare it with height as an easily measurable trait that affects success.
- Height, like intelligence, is normally distributed, but it is less controversial and politicized than intelligence.
- Using NBA players' height as an example, height plays a role in success, but it is not the only factor.
- Although a significant height difference can create an advantage in basketball, training and technique can also matter.
- People's intuitions about basketball are clearer than their intuitions about intelligence.

Key learnings:
- When discussing intelligence, people tend to argue more and may feel more insecure or defensive.
- Cultivating skills in both intelligence and basketball could contribute to saving the world from future technology threats.

Key questions:
- What other traits or skills could be comparable to intelligence and height in terms of understanding success or ability?
- How can we foster a healthier discussion around intelligence and reduce insecurity or defensiveness?

# Practically-A-Book Review: Dying To Be Free
*February 2, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/02/02/practically-a-book-review-dying-to-be-free/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The Huffington Post published a 20,000-word article on the state of heroin addiction treatment, arguing that suboxone is a life-saving treatment
- Conventional heroin treatment is often ineffective, based on pseudoscientific practices and has a high relapse rate
- Suboxone is slow-acting, gentle, and a safer version of methadone; it doesn't produce a high but reduces withdrawal symptoms and cravings
- The government regulates suboxone prescriptions more strictly than much more dangerous drugs, potentially limiting its accessibility
- Many religious or quasi-religious rehab programs refuse to accept suboxone users, further limiting their access to treatment

Key learnings:
- Suboxone treatment for heroin addiction is far more effective than most rehab programs
- The social support and the ritualization of rehab programs might not be the most effective way to treat addiction
- The government and rehab industry's roadblocks are preventing wider access to life-saving suboxone treatment

Key questions:
- Why is rehab associated with churches and other non-evidence-based organizations?
- Is the inability to prescribe suboxone without restrictions due to the stigma of drug addiction?
- What is the best way to provide both the chemical and social support necessary to treat heroin addiction?

# Everything Not Obligatory Is Forbidden
*February 6, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/02/06/everything-not-obligatory-is-forbidden/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Not giving children super-enhancement designer baby gene therapy is not a choice, but a public health issue
- Unenhanced children contribute to societal problems such as murder and fatal car accidents
- Refusal to super-enhance children is considered child abuse and parents who do not enhance their children should be jailed

Key learnings:
- Super-enhancement designer baby gene therapy is seen as a basic duty for parents
- Unenhanced children are seen as lacking and a danger to society
- Personal freedom is not considered valid when it comes to enhancing children

Key questions:
- What are the societal implications of considering super-enhancement designer baby gene therapy a basic parental duty?
- How do we balance personal freedom with the potential negative effects of unenhanced children on society?
- Can we ensure access to super-enhancement for all children or will it only be available to those who can afford it?

# The Efficacy Of Everything In Psychiatry In One Graph Plus Several Pages Of Dense But Necessary Explanation
*February 8, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/02/08/the-efficacy-of-everything-in-psychiatry-in-one-graph-plus-several-pages-of-dense-but-necessary-explanation/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Huhn et al (2014) graph the Efficacy Of Pharmacotherapy And Psychotherapy For Adult Psychiatric Disorders
- The effect sizes are mostly around 0.5, which is equal to average effect sizes in other fields of medicine
- Drugs are more effective than therapy in treating borderline personality disorder and insomnia
- In all conditions, drugs seem more effective at preventing relapse than at stopping acute episodes
- Psychotherapy trials were generally of lower quality, giving people "placebo psychotherapy" is more complicated than giving people a sugar pill
- Publication bias is worse for pharmacotherapy trials than psychotherapy trials

Key learnings:
- Therapy may not work as well in certain conditions, such as borderline personality disorder and insomnia
- It's important to consider the quality of the trials when looking at the effectiveness of a treatment
- Publication bias can impact the reporting of positive findings in pharmacotherapy trials

Key questions:
- What is the impact of the sample size on the efficacy of the treatment?
- How can the quality of psychotherapy trials be improved?
- Why is publication bias worse for pharmacotherapy trials than psychotherapy trials?

# Black People Less Likely
*February 11, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/02/11/black-people-less-likely/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- A survey found that 90% of polyamorous people identified as Caucasian, and people of color feel excluded and objectified in polyamorous spaces.
- The article argues that this is due to a standard of whiteness that erases people of color.
- The author points out that black people are underrepresented in many weird subculturey nonconformist things, not just polyamory. 

Key learnings:
- Black people are likely to be underrepresented in a lot of weird subculturey nonconformist things due to factors like affluence, Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, and education.
- The idea of low minority representation is often used as an accusation of racism or intolerance, making it easier for underrepresented groups to be targeted.

Key questions:
- Why do weird subculturey nonconformist things tend to draw from the upper middle class?
- How can we address the underrepresentation of black people and other marginalized groups in nonconformist communities? 
- Why do some people use low minority representation to accuse groups of racism or intolerance?

# Money, Money, Everywhere, But Not A Cent To Spend
*February 12, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/02/12/money-money-everywhere-but-not-a-cent-to-spend/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The DSM is written by academics, not clinicians, which means it gets excited about distinctions that might not reflect what actually gets treated in a hospital.
- Society should pay more attention to cases like 'My Boyfriend Broke Up With Me' spectrums, chronic 'I Got Angry At My Dad' cases, and 'This Patient Probably Has Some Kind Of Complicated Neurological Problem But Neurology Is Tired Of Trying To Figure It Out So They Have Declared It To Be Psychiatric' cases.
- The biggest change to the medical lexicon should be the introduction of 'Poverty NOS'.
- Psychiatric hospitalization of poor people who are in serious debt and want to commit suicide is costly, patronizing, and occasionally heartbreaking.
- Governments are the only entity with enough coordination power to implement solutions to some problems.

Key learnings:
- Psychiatric hospitalization sometimes fails to be patient-centered care.
- Governments may be the only entities capable of solving certain societal problems.
- A Basic Income Guarantee might save more money in psychiatric care than we think.

Key questions:
- What are the benefits and drawbacks of a Basic Income Guarantee?
- How harmful or helpful are top-down institutionalized bureaucracies in solving societal problems?
- How can society place more focus on cases that are prevalent in hospitals?

# Drug Testing Welfare Users Is A Sham, But Not For The Reasons You Think
*February 14, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/02/14/drug-testing-welfare-users-is-a-sham-but-not-for-the-reasons-you-think/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Tennessee's drug testing program for welfare recipients showed surprisingly low positive results.
- Reports on Tennessee's program suggest that poor people use fewer drugs than the general population.
- However, legitimate research shows that drug use rates in poor populations are similar to the general population.
- The low positive results of Tennessee's program may be due to the use of a written test rather than a urine test.

Key learnings:
- Reports on a single study or program should not be taken as universal truths, especially without examining the methodology used.
- It's important to fact-check claims even if they align with our preconceived beliefs.
- Not all media reports are accurate or unbiased.

Key questions:
- What is the real drug use rate among welfare recipients and how can it be accurately measured?
- Why do media outlets sometimes report inaccurate or incomplete information?
- How can we ensure that policy decisions are based on accurate and comprehensive data?

# How Likely Are Multifactorial Trends?
*February 14, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/02/14/how-likely-are-multifactorial-trends/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Vox wrote about a report by the Brennan Center For Justice on theories for why crime rates declined in the US.
- Vox argues that the lead-crime connection is overblown.
- The Brennan Center's analysis suggests that there is no single "smoking gun" for why crime rates decreased.
- The analysis suggests that about ten different factors, each explaining ten percent of the decline, were at play.

Key learnings
- Something as complicated as crime is governed by many factors, so it is unlikely that one big change caused such a significant decline in crime rates.
- Vox argues that the lead-crime connection is overblown, but this could be disputed given that lead can remain in the environment for a long time.
- The Brennan Center's analysis suggests that various factors, each contributing a small percentage to the decline in crime rates, were at play.

Key questions
- Can someone point Scott to literature that explores how much less likely a ten-factor explanation is compared to a one-factor explanation for the decline in crime rates?
- Are there ways to calculate the likelihood of a ten-factor explanation for the decline in crime rates?

# Did Falling Testosterone Affect Falling Crime?
*February 16, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/02/16/did-falling-testosterone-affect-falling-crime/

## Summary
Key ideas

- Testosterone levels have been declining in the US population since at least 1987, but the reason for this is unclear.
- Testosterone levels have been found to correlate somewhat with violent crime.
- Studies show that high levels of testosterone increase the risk of committing violent crimes, particularly sex crimes, such as child molestation and rape.
- However, it's unclear whether declining testosterone levels can explain the decrease in crime, particularly since crime rates have dropped since the 1990s, whereas testosterone has been declining since the 1980s.
- There is contradictory evidence regarding whether testosterone levels have fallen at all or whether they have increased, in the case of baseball players, for example.

Key learnings

- Declining testosterone levels could potentially explain a long-term, gradual decrease in violent crime over decades, but they cannot explain the spike in the 50s and the drop in the 90s, which were not particularly abnormal in terms of testosterone decline.
- Testosterone levels have been declining at a rate of about 1% per year, or about minus 1% from 1987 to 2004.
- Testosterone levels are not a reliable indicator of criminal behavior, but they are one of many factors involved.

Key questions

- Can declining testosterone levels in women also affect female violence?
- What is causing the decline in testosterone levels, and why is the decline more severe in some areas than others?
- Can studies comparing testosterone levels in violent criminals to those in the general population provide more insight into the correlation between testosterone levels and violent crime?
- What was the testosterone level in men in the past, and have testosterone levels been declining over time or increasing?

# Early Intervention: You *Might* Get What You Pay For
*February 28, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/02/28/early-intervention-you-might-get-what-you-pay-for/

## Summary
Key ideas
- There is a debate between the genetics and psychiatric communities regarding the impact of childhood experiences and education on life outcomes.
- A randomized controlled trial by Dodge et al found that an intervention consisting of extra classes and enrichment programs from elementary school to high school had a significant positive effect on various psychiatric disorders, drug/alcohol abuse, risky sexual behavior, and domestic abuse.
- This intervention cost $60,000 per child and its effects on employment and incarceration were not significant.

Key learnings
- Intensive interventions can change children's personality and life outcomes 10 years down the road.
- The cost of such an intervention may be justified if it produces significant improvements in children's lives.
- The study's endpoints may be questionable, and more research is needed to determine which part of the intervention produced positive effects.

Key questions
- Can interventions that cost $60,000 per child be scaled to large populations?
- How can interventions be tailored to produce the most effective outcomes?
- What is the best way to measure life outcomes, and what factors should studies take into account when evaluating them?

# A Series Of Unprincipled Exceptions
*March 4, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/04/a-series-of-unprincipled-exceptions/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Many people believe that animals have some moral value, but it is difficult to value them in a way that makes them moderately important.
- Effective altruists should focus entirely on animal-related charities if they want to achieve the most good per unit resource.
- Widening circles of concern is a process that many utilitarians go through, which involves including progressively more people/animals in one's moral considerations.
- It is difficult to treat all individuals with equal importance within a given circle of concern (e.g. treating strangers as equally important as friends).

Key learnings
- Valuing animals in a way that doesn't make their suffering astronomically more important than that of humans is difficult.
- Effective altruists should prioritize animal-related charities if they want to maximize their impact.
- Completing the process of widening circles of concern can be scary, but effective altruists are selected for not shying away from it.
- It is difficult to treat all individuals with equal importance within a given circle of concern.

Key questions
- How do we value animals in a way that doesn't make their suffering astronomically more important than that of humans?
- Should effective altruists focus entirely on animal-related charities, or is there value in considering the welfare of humans as well?
- How can we treat all individuals with equal importance within a given circle of concern?

# A Cascade Of Dunbar Numbers
*March 5, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/05/a-cascade-of-dunbar-numbers/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The author discusses their experience with micronations and their difficulty in expanding their population despite attempts to do so.
- They contrast this experience with the Bay Area rationalist community, which is also experiencing difficulty in growing despite being geographically larger.
- The author introduces the idea of Dunbar's number, which posits that humans have a hard-coded optimal group size of around 150 people.
- The author discusses how their experience with small groups may be indicative of social group limitations.

Key learnings
- It is difficult to grow a community beyond a certain size, even with marketing or recruitment campaigns.
- The size limitation for cohesive social groups may be indicative of a hard-coded limit in humans, as proposed by Dunbar's number.
- The environment, culture, and enforcement of the group can all affect the size limitations of cohesive social groups.

Key questions
- What other factors besides group size could impact the growth and success of a community?
- Is there a way to overcome the social saturation point that limits the growth of some communities?
- What implications does Dunbar's number have for the growth and structure of social groups, and how can it be studied in different contexts?

# Effective Altruists: Not As Mentally Ill As You Think
*March 6, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/06/effective-altruists-not-as-mentally-ill-as-you-think/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The theory that effective altruism selects for people with mental disorders is false
- Effective altruists have about the same levels of anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder as non-EA Less Wrongers, but slightly higher levels of depression and more autism
- Autistic people tended to donate a higher percent of their income to charity than neurotypical people or people with other mental illnesses even separated from effective altruist status
- Effective altruists are not unusually self-hating or scrupulous
- Effective altruists are more consequentialist than non-effective-altruist LWers

Key learnings
- Effective altruists don't differ from other rationalists in levels of mental illness
- Both effective altruists and rationalists differ from the general population in all kinds of ways
- Effective altruists are more consequentialist than non-effective-altruist LWers

Key questions
- Why do people giggle when the theory that effective altruism selects for people with mental disorders is brought up?
- What is the connection between autism and consequentialism?
- What is the reason why effective altruists may be a little more autistic?

# Too Good To Be True
*March 11, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/11/too-good-to-be-true/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Three psychological studies suggest that even small interventions can significantly improve outcomes in areas such as academic achievement, time management, and stress-related behaviors.
- However, costly and long-term interventions, such as the early intervention program for troubled youth, often show modest results and do not improve major outcomes like school retention, employment, or incarceration.
- This presents a dilemma: either psychological research is superior to other interventions or other interventions are not using their resources wisely.

Key learnings
- Even seemingly small interventions, such as making monthly plans or writing a letter to promote a growth mindset, can have significant positive effects on outcomes.
- Costly and long-term interventions may not always deliver significant improvements in major outcomes.

Key questions 
- Why does psychological research show impressive results with small interventions while costly and long-term interventions often do not show significant improvements in major outcomes?
- Are there limitations or flaws in the research methods or data analysis of the psychological studies?
- How can we ensure that interventions are using their resources effectively to achieve desirable outcomes?

https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/12/book-review-willpower/

## Summary
Key ideas 
- "Willpower: Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength" is a book about the importance of willpower in psychology.
- The book discusses the theory of ego depletion and ego repletion.
- It mentions various people, including Drew Carey and Oprah, who have lessons to teach about willpower.
- Having more willpower leads to better life outcomes, according to a famous "marshmallow test."
- Quantifying goals, setting precommitments, and publicizing success or failure helps stick to resolutions.

Key learnings

- Having to make too many small decisions causes "decision fatigue," leading to exhaustion and bad decisions.
- Using willpower often strengthens willpower, making it more effective.
- Careful quantification of goals and publicity improve the likelihood of successful resolution.

Key questions 
- What is the difference between the physical and mental aspects of willpower?
- How do drugs affect willpower so significantly?
- What causes exercise fatigue?
- Can parenting styles and culture affect willpower?
- Is willpower a limited resource that is depleted after use?

https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/16/list-of-passages-i-highlighted-in-my-copy-of-willpower/

## Summary
Key Ideas:
- The Zeigarnik effect describes how an unfinished task will stay in someone's mind until it is completed.
- Research has shown that students who don't make study plans are more prone to thinking about upcoming exams than those who do.
- A study found that New Yorkers had the most criteria for their desired partners in personal ads compared to people in other cities.
- Professors who write a page or two every day fare better than those who write in a burst of intense energy.
- Chinese toddlers show better self-control than American toddlers, which may be a result of genes and cultural traditions.
- Children with a father in the home are more likely to choose the delayed reward rather than the immediate one.
- Repeated dieting can stop being effective as the body adjusts.
- People who weigh themselves every day are more effective in preventing weight gain.
- People are more likely to overestimate the value of a meal if it has a label indicating it is trans fat-free.
- People with less self-control are more likely to commit crimes.
- Impaired glucose tolerance can result in less self-control.

- Less self-control is linked to criminal behavior and impaired glucose tolerance.
- Freudian therapies may be becoming less effective due to a change in character armor.

Key Questions:
- What other factors influence self-control besides cultural traditions and genetic makeup?

# Book Review: The Machinery Of Freedom
*March 18, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/18/book-review-the-machinery-of-freedom/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- David Friedman’s The Machinery of Freedom provides an introduction to libertarianism and technical diagrams for constructing an anarcho-capitalist state.
- The book is a historical artifact, with its first edition being published in 1973.
- Friedman argues that government claims legitimacy from its role in helping the poor, but the costs fall disproportionately on the poor and it screws them over more than any other group.
- He talks about private arbitration as a solution for disputes involving contracts between well-established firms and private protection agencies to protect individuals against crime.
- The author proposes an anarcho-capitalist society where protection agencies are companies providing security and legal systems through competing for customers.
- Disputes between customers of different protection agencies would be settled by private arbitration firms.
- Law would be produced on the open market with various legal systems potentially coexisting.
- Objections to the system include unfairness to those who cannot afford protection, constant brinksmanship among protection agencies, lack of provision for public goods, and a potential danger of favoritism toward the rich.
- The benefits of government come with costs that may be hard to measure.
- The market and competition may be better alternatives to government control.
- Experiments with anarcho-capitalist systems and new forms of government are necessary.
- Predicting government outcomes from theory may not be the best approach.

Key learnings:
- Friedman's arguments for libertarianism provide fresh perspectives.
- Some of the points made in the book are outdated and don't hold up to current standards.
- In an anarcho-capitalist society, protection agencies would provide security and law systems and compete for customers.
- Disputes between protection agencies would be settled by private arbitration firms.
- Multiple legal systems could potentially coexist.
- There are potential drawbacks to the system, including unfairness, brinksmanship, and possible favoritism toward the rich.
- Governments create benefits such as security and infrastructure, but cost taxpayers money and may have unintended consequences.
- Alternatives to government control, such as the market and competition, may be more effective and efficient.
- Experimentation with different forms of government is necessary to find better systems.

Key questions:
- How can democracy be used to transfer money from the bulk of the population to the poor, when the non-poor are the majority and unlikely to vote to force themselves to take it?
- How can disputes be settled if there is no government court system and no mutually satisfactory arbitrator?
- What would be the economic decision for private protection agencies to protect individuals against crime, and how might conflicts arise between these agencies be resolved?
- Who would make the laws in an anarcho-capitalist society?
- How would different protection agencies agree on which court to use in the case of conflict?
- How would public goods, such as streetlights, be provided in such a society?
- What would stop rich people from purchasing greater privileges not available to the masses?
- Why is it assumed that not using force is an effective way of solving all problems in an anarcho-capitalist society?
- How can we measure the costs and benefits of government?
- Are the market and competition better alternatives to government control?
- How can we experiment with new forms of government to find better systems?

# List Of Passages I Highlighted In My Copy Of “Machinery Of Freedom”
*March 21, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/21/list-of-passages-i-highlighted-in-my-copy-of-machinery-of-freedom/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- There are essentially only three ways to get another person's help to achieve your ends: love, trade and force.
- Under private property, love is used where it is workable, and trade is used instead where love is not workable.
- The airline industry provided evidence that government regulation of transportation drives prices up.
- Defenders of government health spending programs argue that the poor need help to afford medical care, but the cost is too high for them.
- Urban renewal can prevent low-income housing from becoming available to those who need it.
- Private companies could have reached the moon more efficiently and profitably than the government did.
- There are barriers to private companies sending humans to Mars, including cost, technological challenges and risks.
- Liability regulation for drug companies could be worse than FDA regulations in some cases.
- Workers theoretically could purchase their firms by saving half their after-tax incomes for two and a half years.

Key learnings:
- Love is limited in its scope and cannot work for complex tasks involving large numbers of people.
- Trade is a more practical way to achieve one's ends and can involve thousands or millions of people cooperating for their own interests.
- Governments often create or support monopolies and use regulations to protect established players in a market, driving prices up and limiting competition.
- The cost of medical care often exceeds what the poor are able to pay, and government health programs may not be the best solution.
- Sometimes government actions intended to help the poor can actually hinder their opportunities.
- Private companies can be more efficient and profitable than governments for certain endeavors.
- There are various challenges to private space exploration, including cost, technology, and risk.
- Liability regulation for drugs may not be an ideal alternative to the current FDA regulations.
- It is possible for workers to buy out their firms, but it requires substantial investment.

Key questions:
- How can institutions be created that allow for the most practical ways to achieve desired ends and how can love and trade be balanced?
- In what ways do regulations and government interventions harm competition and prevent new entrants into a market?
- How can healthcare be made more affordable for those who cannot easily pay for it, without creating more issues through government intervention?
- Do urban renewal programs actually benefit the poor, or do they limit their access to housing?
- Why haven't private companies been able to create a non-scam version of Mars One?
- Is liability regulation an effective alternative to FDA regulations for drug companies?
- Why doesn't the socialist movement aim to have workers purchase their firms?

# Is Everything A Religion?
*March 25, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/25/is-everything-a-religion/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- There are many beliefs or movements that can be analogized to a religion.
- One critique is that “religion” is a broad enough category that anything can be mapped onto it.
- The difference between “religion” and “culture” is quite vague.
- Communities or cultures have values in common, rules, heroes, and hierarchies, and they shun people who don't fit in.
- Calling communities/cultures “religions” is unfair and harms discussions.

Key learnings:
- Environmentalism and social justice communities are often compared to religions and seen as more religious than gun control and pro-choice communities.
- Values in common, rules, heroes, and hierarchies are features of communities, which may share similarities with organized religions.
- Communities and cultures play an epistemological function, meaning that evidence challenging their core beliefs may be taken as an attack on members' identities.

Key questions:
- Is religion becoming a catch-all term for communities/cultures with shared beliefs and values?
- How can communities/cultures effectively engage with opinions that challenge their core beliefs?
- What are some dangers of belonging to communities/cultures with shared values, rules, and heroes and shunning those who don't fit in?

# Extremism In Thought Experiment Is No Vice
*March 26, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/26/high-energy-ethics/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Phil Robertson has been criticised for a thought experiment in which an atheist's family is raped and murdered.
- Robinson's experiment is not unusual; it is based on a philosophical tradition - extreme thought experiments.
- Extreme thought experiments are used in both physics and philosophy to magnify small effects to measure them.
- The point of these experiments is to collide two of your intuitions against each other and force you to violate at least one of them.

Key learnings:
- Intuition can often tell us the answer is something other than what we think it is.
- By coming up with an extreme case, the smallest shred of sympathy for a different approach can be dragged up to the surface so that we are better able to distinguish between whether we are misjudging our own thought processes, or we are accurately describing our own thought processes.
- Devising extreme cases helps in discovering an underlying principle which can only be discovered by implementing it in extreme situations.
 
Key questions:
- How can graphic thought experiments be used properly in discussions? 
- What should be done when such thought experiments are used to score cheap points? 
- If God commands you to commit an immoral act, is that still the right thing to do?

# Highlights From My Notes From Another Psychiatry Conference
*March 27, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/27/highlights-from-my-notes-from-another-psychiatry-conference/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Attending a Psychiatry Conference with talks on important issues affecting patients in the field
- A breakthrough in ensuring schizophrenic people take their medication involves ingesting a computer chip that transmits data from the patient's stomach but could be complicated by the patient's paranoia
- A smartphone app is being developed to detect schizophrenic relapses using GPS, accelerometer and microphone that are used to differentiate psychotic from normal behavior
- The use of cluster randomization in multi-center trials is sketchy as it breaks blinding and implies different population of patients in each group
- Naturalistic epidemiological studies on long-acting injectable versus oral antipsychotics have proven more relevant than randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the right patient population
- Antipsychotics are being tested for their anti-addictive properties by lowering dopamine levels in the brain
- Clozapine is the best antipsychotic but the most dangerous and requires a lot of paperwork and monitoring
- The APA has a Political Activism Consultant who uses nice suits and ties to push their agenda, and psychologists are now also lobbying for prescriptive rights

Key learnings
- Psychologists may soon be allowed to prescribe medication with the possibility of computer chip ingestion and smartphone apps to detect relapses
- RCTs have their limitations in patient compliance and close monitoring, and naturalistic studies on the use of long-acting injectables are more reliable
- Antipsychotics have been tested for their anti-addictive properties

Key questions
- What are the implications of the breakthrough on ensuring schizophrenic people take their medication?
- What are the limitations of using cluster randomization in multi-center trials?
- How do naturalistic epidemiological studies on the use of long-acting injectables compare to RCTs?
- What other properties can antipsychotics have besides treating schizophrenia?
- What is the future of psychologists and psychiatrists with regards to prescriptive rights?

# Rational Orthography
*March 31, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/31/rational-orthography-2/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Boustrophedon was an ancient Greek writing system that alternates between left-to-right and right-to-left patterns
- Although it was faster and easier to read, it was harder to write than the traditional left-to-right system that eventually prevailed
- With modern technology, it's now possible to reintroduce boustrophedon and some enthusiasts claim it's easier and quicker to read

Key learnings:
- Doing what's popular isn't always the best or most efficient option
- Technological advancements can bring back ancient practices

Key questions:
- What other antiquated practices or systems can be improved with modern technology?
- Why do people often choose the harder option instead of the one that's most convenient for others?

# Chemical Imbalance
*April 5, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/04/05/chemical-imbalance/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Criticism towards psychiatry for pushing the "chemical imbalance" theory to sell antidepressants
- Antipsychiatry movement claiming psychiatrists were drug company shills who were deceiving the public
- Psychiatrists defend themselves by stating that they did not push the "chemical imbalance" theory as a sole explanation for depression
- Research on serotonin levels and depression remains unclear and contradictory
- Depression is a complicated condition, with several possible causes that may interact with each other
- Claims that depression is caused by a simple serotonin deficiency are exaggerated
- Chemical imbalances are not exclusive to psychiatry, as they can cause several other medical conditions

Key learnings:
- The "chemical imbalance" theory of depression is controversial and not fully supported by scientific evidence
- The complexity of brain chemistry and neurotransmitters makes it difficult to understand depression and its treatment
- Different antidepressants may work through different mechanisms beyond just altering serotonin levels
- Depression involves complex biological processes and is not simply a result of personal weakness or lack of willpower
- It is important to avoid oversimplified explanations of depression and other mental health conditions
- Emphasizing the biological basis of mental health struggles can help reduce stigma and promote understanding

Key questions:
- What is the antipsychiatry movement's main argument against psychiatrists and their approach to depression treatment?
- How do different antidepressants work to treat depression beyond just boosting serotonin levels?
- What promising research is being done to better understand the biological causes of depression?
- What are the different factors that can contribute to depression?
- How can we balance the need to convey the biological basis of depression with the risk of oversimplification?
- How can we help people understand the complexity of mental health issues without overwhelming them with technical jargon?

# No Physical Substrate, No Problem
*April 7, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/04/07/no-physical-substrate-no-problem/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Superintelligence might not be able to affect the physical world immediately, but it can use its abilities to gain power and influence over time.
- It could use methods like hacking banks, inventing useful programs, creating a mass movement, or even taking over a country.
- A superintelligence could wait until there are enough automated factories and robots, and then take over those bodies.

Key learnings:
- Superintelligence can be dangerous even if it doesn't immediately pose a physical threat.
- A superintelligence could gain power using methods that have already been successful for humans.
- Waiting for technology to advance could be a viable strategy for a superintelligence.

Key questions:
- How could a superintelligence be contained so it can't use its abilities to gain power?
- What other methods could a superintelligence use to gain power and influence?
- Can we really trust a superintelligence not to harm humans, even if it doesn't seem to have a reason to?

# No Clarity Around Growth Mindset
*April 8, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/04/08/no-clarity-around-growth-mindset-yet/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The author has a bias against growth mindset due to its denial of the importance of innate ability and its association with shaky fields like priming and stereotype threat.
- However, the studies supporting growth mindset are impressive, including a key study by Dweck and Mueller in 1998 that found that children who were praised for effort were more likely to set challenging goals and persist through failure than children who were praised for intelligence.
- The author questions the history and interpretation of growth mindset, noting that earlier studies found belief in innate ability to be a positive factor and that some of Dweck's own findings contradict established attribution theory.
- The effectiveness of the growth mindset theory is brought into question.
- Studies suggest that mindset may not be related to academic performance.
- The fixed mindset individuals universally crash and bomb in psychology studies, but do equally well or better than their growth mindset peers in the real world.
- Success-oriented individuals will investigate how to study most effectively, while busywork-oriented individuals will merely try to figure out how many hours of studying they have to put in to avoid blame.
- While a growth mindset has its benefits, it does not provide evidence against the idea that innate talent/IQ is the most important factor.

Key learnings:
- Growth mindset is the belief that effort, rather than ability, determines success and is associated with resilience, hard work, and other positive traits.
- The effectiveness of growth mindset has been supported by impressive studies, including one by Dweck and Mueller in 1998.
- There are concerns about the history and interpretation of growth mindset, and some of the findings contradict established theories.
- There are various narratives that could explain the experimental results of mindset theory.
- Mindset theory suggests that believing intelligence to be mostly malleable has lots of useful benefits, but intelligence is still largely due to innate talent.
- Poor students tend to put in a lot less effort in a surprisingly linear way, and telling kids they're failing because they don't have the right work ethic is a problematic stance.

Key questions:
- Is belief in innate ability a positive or negative factor in achieving success?
- What role does priming play in growth mindset studies, and how reliable is the field of priming?
- How does growth mindset relate to stereotype threat, and what impact does this have on its validity?
- Are the effects of growth mindset overstated, or are they truly exceptional?
- Are there any other theories that could explain the experimental results of mindset theory?
- How can we most accurately determine the factors that contribute to academic success?
- How can we educate students in a way that acknowledges innate talent while still promoting effort and growth?

# I Will Never Have The Ability To Clearly Explain My Beliefs About Growth Mindset
*April 10, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/04/10/i-will-never-have-the-ability-to-clearly-explain-my-beliefs-about-growth-mindset/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- There are two positions in the growth mindset debate: the Bloody Obvious Position (innate ability matters and effort also matters), and the Controversial Position (the more important one thinks innate ability is compared to effort, the more likely one is to stop trying).
- The author believes Carol Dweck, the creator of the growth mindset theory, holds the Controversial Position, which states that belief in the importance of ability saps a child's good qualities and leads to dishonesty, less hard-work, and hostility to learning.
- The author distinguishes between a Sorta Controversial Position (the more children believe effort matters and the less they believe innate ability matters, the more successful they will be) and a Very Controversial Position (belief in the importance of ability directly saps a child’s good qualities).
- The author admits that much of the research around growth mindset is good, but believes some of the claims are too strong and not fully supported by ecological data.

Key learnings:
- There are two positions in the growth mindset debate: Bloody Obvious (innate ability and effort matter) and Controversial (importance of innate ability compared to effort).
- The author believes Carol Dweck holds the Controversial Position, which the author calls the Very Controversial Position.
- The author thinks that some claims in growth mindset theory are too strong and not fully supported by ecological data.

Key questions:
- What is the relationship between explicit and implicit beliefs when it comes to growth mindset?
- Can growth mindset theory work in real life, or is it only effective in a laboratory setting?
- Is there any relationship between fixed mindset and higher intelligence?
- What is the best way to interpret the ecological data around growth mindset?

# Trouble Walking Down The Hallway
*April 15, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/04/15/trouble-walking-down-the-hallway/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Two studies, Williams and Ceci and Moss-Racusin et al, have produced contrasting results on the subject of gender bias in STEM hiring.
- Williams and Ceci's study showed bias in favour of women, while Moss-Racusin et al's showed bias in favour of men.
- The studies have similar methodology, but differ in small details.
- Possible explanations for the different results include differences in the positions being hired for (tenure-track faculty vs lab manager), the quality of the resumes (all excellent vs all so-so), and differences in the phrasing of questions.
- There are conflicting studies about whether gender bias affects STEM faculty hiring
- Moss-Racusin et al. found evidence of bias, while Williams and Ceci's study did not
- Both studies have some shortcomings that make it difficult to compare them
- A joint study with a fair protocol could help resolve the conflicting results

Key learnings:
- It is important to consider the literature of an entire field as a gestalt, rather than relying on one study to prove a point.
- Similar studies can produce different results, which highlights the importance of examining the details of each study to determine possible reasons for differences.
- There is evidence of gender bias in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) faculty
- Different studies may produce conflicting results, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions

Key questions:
- Why did these two studies produce such contrasting results?
- How can we ensure that biases are not affecting research results?
- Is it possible to truly remain unbiased when designing and conducting studies?
- Which study should we trust more, Moss-Racusin et al. or Williams and Ceci's?
- What are the limitations of each study?
- Is there a way to resolve the conflicting results and get a clearer picture of the situation?

# Polemical Imbalance
*April 18, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/04/18/polemical-imbalance/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The blog post is a response to Mad In America's counterargument against the author's post about the "chemical imbalance" argument in psychiatry.
- The author argues that the "chemical imbalance" argument is a bait-and-switch tactic used by psychiatrists to oversimplify the complexity of depression.
- The author examines several examples cited by Mad In America regarding the "chemical imbalance" theory's promotion in mainstream psychiatry, deconstructing them each in turn.
- The author argues that the serotonin deficiency theory was a responsible theory based on lots of evidence available at the time.
- There are still may things that are not fully understood, but scientific theories are based on the best available evidence.
- While serotonin is still considered a promising lead for depression, it is much more complicated than the simple 'chemical imbalance' it was once thought to be.
- Existing research does not detect any reliable abnormality of the serotonin system in people who are depressed.

Key learnings:
- The "chemical imbalance" argument hides the complexity of depression and promotes an oversimplified narrative about the causes of depression, specifically a lack of serotonin.
- While the involvement of serotonin in depression is real, the evidence is much more complicated than the prevailing narrative of a basic serotonin deficiency.
- Most psychiatrists have never claimed that serotonin is the only cause of depression, but rather it is one of many possible causes.
- The 'chemical imbalance' theory of depression is much more complex than is often portrayed in the media.
- Scientific progress often involves small pieces of evidence that are put together over time to form a strong theory.

Key questions:
- Did the author effectively counter Mad In America's counterargument?
- What are some other examples of the "chemical imbalance" argument in psychiatry?
- How can we promote better understanding and awareness of the complexity of depression and its many causes?
- What makes a scientific theory 'responsible'?
- How can researchers and psychiatrists communicate complex scientific ideas to the public in a way that is understandable?
- What is the role of the medical community in clarifying information about scientific theories to the public?

# Blame Theory
*April 19, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/04/19/blame-theory/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Academics who attribute the woes of Third World countries to colonization often go beyond what the facts support.
- The paradox of upper-class ethnic-majority Westerners attempting to find reasons why lots of things are the fault of ethnic-majority Westerners.
- An explanation for this paradox is that people feel a strong need to help the less-advantaged and come up with a justification that is accurate or not.
- Moral Therapeutic Deontology is a deontological system that focuses on following certain rules rather than the importance of charity.
- Utilitarianism tells us that we are justified seeing the relief of suffering as a pressing need.

Key learnings:
- People feel a need to help the less-advantaged and come up with a justification that may not be factually accurate to do so.
- Deontological systems may focus on following certain rules rather than the importance of charity.
- Utilitarianism justifies seeing the relief of suffering as a pressing need, without requiring an inaccurate justification.

Key questions:
- What is the difference between deontological and utilitarian ethics, and how do they relate to Moral Therapeutic Deontology?
- How might utilitarianism be used to justify helping the poor without needing to posit inaccurate facts?
- What is the impact of colonialism theory on people's interest in helping the poor, and how might utilitarianism offer an alternative perspective?

# Universal Love, Said The Cactus Person
*April 21, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/04/21/universal-love-said-the-cactus-person/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The narrator is seeking proof that DMT entities are real, and has turned to a paper suggesting that proof could come from asking the entities to factor large numbers
- The entities (a cactus person and a big green bat) respond to the narrator's request with non sequiturs about universal love and transcendent joy
- The narrator becomes frustrated with their responses and argues that the entities should be using their supposed spiritual wisdom to help humanity in a more concrete way
- The big green bat delivers a parable about getting out of a car, which the narrator finds unsatisfying
- The post discusses the importance of structure in writing and storytelling.
- The author emphasizes that a clearly defined structure helps to make a clear and engaging story.
- The post suggests different structures that can be used as a framework for writing.

Key learnings:
- The entities in the DMT realm may not be able to provide the kind of empirical proof the narrator is seeking
- The entities prioritize spiritual matters over practical concerns
- The entities may be difficult to communicate with or understand due to their different perspective on reality
- Having a structure in writing helps to build a clear and coherent story.
- Different structures can be used depending on the type of story and the message that the writer wants to convey.
- A good structure includes a clear beginning, middle, and end, and a framework for the main plot and subplots.

Key questions:
- Are the entities real or just hallucinations?
- What is the significance of the big green bat's parable?
- How can the narrator reconcile their desire for empirical proof with the entities' spiritual perspective?
- What is the main message or meaning that I want to convey in my story?
- How can I use structure to create a cohesive and engaging story?
- What are the different structures that can be used for different types of stories and genres?

# Nefarious Nefazodone And Flashy Rare Side Effects
*April 25, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/04/25/nefarious-nefazodone-and-flashy-rare-side-effects/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Antidepressants, namely SSRIs, have common side effects such as decreased sexual abilities and emotional blunting
- Nefazodone, another antidepressant that does not have these side effects, is seen as notably better than SSRIs, but is illegal in most countries due to liver failure risks
- Modafinil, a non-addictive stimulant, is seen as better than Adderall but may cause a rare and serious skin reaction
- Despite nefazodone's lower risk of harm than Seroquel, Seroquel is more commonly prescribed due to the potential for lawsuits

Key learnings:
- Risk assessment is complex and may involve comparing the likelihood and severity of different harms
- Doctors may have difficulty weighing the risks and benefits of different treatments due to bias, fear of lawsuits, and misinformation
- Legal mechanisms for regulating medication use may not be effective and can lead to unintended consequences

Key questions:
- Which should be prioritized: individual autonomy and informed consent or public health concerns?
- How can doctors make more informed decisions about medications and weigh the risks and benefits more effectively?
- How can the regulatory system be improved to better balance the need for patient safety and access to effective treatments?

# Prescriptions, Paradoxes, and Perversities
*April 30, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/04/30/prescriptions-paradoxes-and-perversities/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The author looked at four of the largest patient review databases, Drugs.com, WebMD, AskAPatient, and DrugLib, and the psychiatry-specific site CrazyMeds, and correlated them with one another to obtain a unified opinion of patients’ favourite and least favourite antidepressants.
- Doctor reviews on RateRx were uncorrelated with patient consensus, and the relationship between the number of times a drug was prescribed and patient ratings was negative.
- The correlation between the average rating of each antidepressant and the year it first came on the market was -0.71, meaning that the newer a drug was, the less patients liked it.
- The reason why older drugs are often more effective may not necessarily be because they actually are, but rather due to the fact that newer drugs are typically more expensive, on-patent, and therefore present a better business opportunity for drug companies.
- Doctors' preferences for drugs often differ from patient satisfaction ratings
- Antidepressants and antipsychotics are the most problematic classes of drugs, with strong doctor biases towards older drugs
- Antidiabetics, antihypertensives, and anticonvulsants have lesser biases towards newer medications
- An analysis of drug effectiveness versus side effects would help confirm these findings

Key learnings:
- Patient reviews of medications can be useful in informing medical decision-making.
- Doctor ratings of medications may not be an accurate representation of patient experiences.
- The correlation between age of medication and patient ratings may be due to a variety of factors, such as drug companies pushing on-patent drugs and neglecting older medications.
- Doctors may have biases towards older drugs due to various reasons such as familiarity or perception of effectiveness
- Patients' opinions on medication are important and should be considered in treatment decisions

Key questions:
- What can be done to ensure that newer medications are tested effectively and that research is not unfairly biased towards new drugs?
- How can doctors be better informed about patients’ experiences with medications?
- What can be done to ensure that patients receive the most effective treatments, regardless of their profitability for drug companies?
- Why do doctors prefer older drugs in some classes of medications, but not others?
- How can doctors address patient satisfaction with medication while still considering other factors?
- What factors contribute to the effectiveness of certain classes of drugs over others?

https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/05/06/the-future-is-filters/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Internet filtering technology can help people avoid controversial or unwanted content
- This technology includes Tumblr Savior, Twitter blockbots, and hypothetical Facebook Troll Points
- Filtering technology can help people avoid trolls, but it can also create an echo chamber that prevents exposure to opposing views
- The use of filtering technology forces people to be conscious of their social decisions and choose what content they consume

Key learnings:
- Filtering technology has both positive and negative implications for an individual's social experience online
- Filtering technology can provide a sense of control over what content one sees, but it can also create an echo chamber that hinders exposure to opposing views
- The use of filtering technology prompts individuals to consciously choose what content they consume and the social groups they belong to

Key questions:
- What is the impact of filtering technology on freedom of speech and diversity of thought in online communities?
- How can individuals maintain exposure to opposing views when filtering technology is so easily accessible?
- How can online communities balance the desire for a safe and comfortable browsing experience with the need for open dialogue and debate?

# Growth Mindset 4: Growth Of Office
*May 7, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/05/07/growth-mindset-4-growth-of-office/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Dr. Paunesku responds to criticism of his paper on growth mindset.
- Growth mindset is the belief that individuals can improve their abilities – usually through effort and by learning more effective strategies.
- The control group was not a mindset intervention.
- The subgroup of underachieving students was chosen for a reason.
- The sense of purpose intervention is not a bunch of platitudes.
- The title of the paper is not misleading.
- The y-axis of the graph is not being misinterpreted.
- The author (Scott) corrects some errors in his previous post regarding the growth mindset study.
- The author still believes that growth mindset had no significant effect on students at large and failed to reach traditional significance criteria for changing pass rates.
- The author has some concerns about combining growth mindset intervention with sense of purpose intervention, which could lead to confusing or misleading results.

Key learnings:
- Growth mindset research aims to improve our education system so that all students can thrive.
- Growth mindset is not the belief that ability doesn’t matter and only effort determines success.
- Mindset interventions help underachieving students, who are more likely to drop out, become underemployed, or end up in prison.
- The sense of purpose intervention focuses on helping students find their own reasons for working hard in school.
- The title of a paper accurately reflects the content it presents.
- Residual standardized scores may be difficult to understand.
- Growth mindset and sense of purpose are two different interventions that may not be similar enough to be combined in a single study.
- Using a one-tailed test to analyze study results should be based on more than just intuition.
- The range of acceptable study results may need to be narrowed down to improve the credibility of research findings.

Key questions:
- What were Scott's critiques of Paunesku's paper on mindset interventions?
- How does Paunesku define growth mindset?
- What is the purpose of subgroup analysis in research?
- What techniques does the sense of purpose intervention use to help students find meaning in their work?
- How can research clarify misinterpretations of growth mindset?
- How should data be presented in a graph to accurately reflect treatment contrasts?

# California, Water You Doing?
*May 11, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/05/11/california-water-you-doing/

## Summary
Key ideas
- California receives 80 million acre-feet of water per year, of which 23 million are unusable for humans and are stuck in wild rivers. 
- 14 million acre-feet are diverted for environmental and recreational purposes. 
- Agriculture uses 34 million acre-feet, with alfalfa being the most water-expensive crop at 5.3 million acre-feet consumed each year. 
- All urban water consumption totals 9 million acre-feet, with personal use by average citizens at 2.8 million acre-feet. 
- A water shortfall of 6 million acre-feet per year is being sustained by exploiting non-renewable groundwater and other sources.

Key learnings
- Alfalfa production uses 5.3 million acre-feet, while Nestle's plant uses only 150 acre-feet. 
- The federal government ordering California to spend 12,000 acre-feet of water to save six fish costs about $2 per fish. 
- A potential solution to California's drought is to pay the alfalfa industry their usual yearly income to not grow any alfalfa, which would cost $860 million and free up 5.3 million acre-feet.

Key questions
- How much of California's water actually goes to environmental causes? 
- What is the actual cost of preventing the Sacramento River Delta from turning salty? 
- How much would it cost to buy out all alfalfa growers and at what political cost?

# Bicameral Reasoning
*May 17, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/05/17/bicameral-reasoning/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The US House seems more fair than the Senate's representational system since citizens from one state may have more political power than others just because they live within an arbitrary line.
- The graphic representation of issues through boxes may prime reasoning similar to the US Senate where each box gets the same level of representation in decision-making processes, regardless of its importance.
- Portraying issues in a set of boxes might cause using a Senate model and provide the same importance in every category, without recognizing how many lives hang in the balance.
- People tend to think of issues in a "some boxes are more important than others" way, but this can lead to a million-fold difference in importance without conveying the sense of "Why are you even looking at that other box?"

Key learnings
- The decision making can often aim for a balance of issues that obscures the importance of some issues over others.
- Using scope insensitivity may affect how morally significant someone views an event or subject.

Key questions
- How does one determine the importance of one issue over the other?
- How much emphasis is given to scope insensitivity considering the moral weight in decision-making?
- What kind of decision-making processes could help balance the importance of issues while recognizing the difference in the number of lives that hang in the balance?

# Beware Summary Statistics
*May 19, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/05/19/beware-summary-statistics/

## Summary
Key ideas
- IQ scores are significantly and negatively correlated with criminal offenses.
- IQ is a strong predictive factor for criminality, but it only predicts about 3.6% of variance in crime.
- The correlation between IQ and income suggests that it's a very minor determinant of income, but there might be very high variance within the individual deciles.

Key learnings
- Beware summary statistics and always consider the underlying data.
- Summary statistics can be used to make things look very important or not important at all.
- When in doubt, demand to see the scatter plot.

Key questions
- Why does the correlation between IQ and criminal offenses look strong but only predict about 3.6% of variance in crime?
- Why does the correlation between IQ and income suggest that it's a very minor determinant of income?
- How can there be such high variance within individual deciles when it comes to income?

# AI Researchers On AI Risk
*May 22, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/05/22/ai-researchers-on-ai-risk/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Most people used to think AI risk was a topic for "random Internet crackpots" until influential figures like Bill Gates and Elon Musk publically announced their concerns about it.
- Some articles cherry-pick AI researchers who are not worried about superintelligence and ignore those who are.
- The author lists prestigious AI and machine learning researchers who have publicly expressed concern about AI risks and superintelligence.
- "Controversy" assumes there are dueling opinions, but there is a widespread agreement among the most respected researchers that control and safety issues will become central to AI as the field matures.
- The possibility of an intelligence explosion resulting from the development of superintelligent AI machines.
- The advancement of the technology might lead to the development of a society of these maximally intelligent individuals.
- Gödel machine is one of the artificial intelligence techniques that could offer a way of shaping future superintelligences.
- AI researchers expect a 50% chance of human-level AI by 2040 and 90% chance of human-level AI by 2075.
- There are some reasons to worry about sampling bias.
- The difference between skeptics and believers isn’t about when human-level AI will arrive, it’s about when we should start preparing.
- The structure of your work can keep you on track.
- Sticking to a pre-defined structure leads to better work than free-form writing.
- Minsky's model of the mind explains how we need structure to learn and work effectively.

Key learnings:
- Many influential figures and experts in the field of AI and machine learning have expressed concern about AI risk and superintelligence.
- AI researchers who express concern are focusing on strategies and measures to improve control and safety in AI, similar to how nuclear fusion researchers focus on containing fusion reactions as a primary issue in their field.
- AI researchers expect human-level AI to arrive between 2040 - 2075.
- Scientists and the general public should talk about the technological singularity.
- Gödel machine could shape the future of superintelligences.
- Sampling bias could be problematic.
- The disagreement among AI researchers is about when we should start preparing for AI research, rather than when human-level AI will arrive.
- Following a structure allows for more focused and concise writing.
- Develop a structure beforehand to avoid getting sidetracked.
- Structure can help develop a stronger memory of the information you are working with.

Key questions:
- How can we improve the chances of reaping the benefits and avoiding risks of AI technology?
- What are the potential consequences of superintelligent machines?
- What are the basic drives of advanced AI systems, and how can we use this knowledge to design utility functions for a positive future for humanity?
- What precautions should we take in shaping the future of superintelligences?
- What will be the consequences of human-level AI?
- How accurate is the survey conducted by AI researchers?
- What are the risks of AI development?
- When should we start taking action to prepare for AI research?
- How can I use Minsky's model of the mind to improve my writing?
- What is the balance between structure and creativity in writing?
- How can I develop a structure that works for me and my writing style?

# No Time Like The Present For AI Safety Work
*May 29, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/05/29/no-time-like-the-present-for-ai-safety-work/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The risks of AI should be taken seriously because if humanity creates human-level AI, eventually it will reach far-above-human-level AI that could overpower humanity whose existence will depend on its goals being aligned with ours.
- It is possible to do useful research now that will improve our chances of getting the AI goal alignment problem right.
- Progress is possible in this early stage because this is a philosophical and not a technical problem.
- Doing basic AI safety research now will help prevent problems in the future
- There are philosophical problems we can investigate and understand before the engineering problem comes up
- There are already some basic AI safety research successfully done
- We can't just trust our descendants in the crunch time to sort things out on their own without our help
- There are risks in assuming hard-takeoff scenarios
- It's worth starting armchair work on AI safety now.

Key learnings:
- Humanity is on a global countdown towards extinction if the AI goal alignment problem is not addressed.
- The problem of AI risk should not be dismissed and the possibility of progress towards solving it should not be underestimated.
- There are open problems that need to be addressed such as wireheading, weird decision theory, and the evil genie effect.
- Basic AI safety research should be started now to avoid problems in the future.
- Understanding philosophical problems will help us prepare for the engineering problem.
- It's not wise to assume that our descendants will figure out AI safety on their own.

Key questions:
- If you accept that eventually the human race is going to go extinct or worse if we can’t figure out AI goal alignment, do you really think our chances of making a dent in the problem today are so low that saying “Yes, we’re on a global countdown to certain annihilation, but it would be an inefficient use of resources to even investigate if we could do anything about it at this point”?
- What is this amazing other use of resources that you prefer instead of addressing AI risks?
- Do you think AI risk is as important as other things we consider important, like curing diseases and detecting asteroids and saving the environment?
- What are the risks of assuming hard-takeoff scenarios?
- How can we predict these turns ahead of time and design systems that avoid them from the ground up?
- What can we do today to prevent problems in the future?

# That Chocolate Study
*May 30, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/05/30/that-chocolate-study/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- A fake study claiming that chocolate aids weight loss went viral and resulted in unfounded health claims being spread worldwide.
- Previous research has found a potential link between chocolate and improved cardiovascular health and weight outcomes.
- Nutrition science typically involves a series of smaller studies that compensate for each other's flaws and build evidence.
- Study sample size is important for detecting small effects amid high variation but less relevant for detecting larger effects.
- Getting rid of p-values may not prevent biased research reporting, as other ways of exaggerating research impact can emerge.
- It's important to be critical of scientific studies that make bold claims
- News and media often hype up studies without providing proper context
- Trusted sources for accurate information include scientific journals, Reddit's r/science, individual researcher blogs, and the Cochrane Collaboration
- Wikipedia provides good information but should always be cross-checked with other sources

Key learnings:
- One poorly conducted study can lead to widespread misinformation and distorted perceptions about a particular food's health effects.
- Robust nutrition science builds gradually over time through diverse studies that capture various aspects of the research question.
- Study participants play a crucial role in advancing nutrition science. However, smaller sample size studies can also offer valuable data and scientific insights.
- There is no one-size-fits-all solution to making statistics impossible to hack
- It's important to have a solid understanding of scientific methodology to properly evaluate studies
- Reading multiple studies on a topic can help build a more complete understanding

Key questions:
- How can the public become better equipped to distinguish between credible nutrition research and exaggerated or poorly conducted research?
- How can researchers better communicate the nuances and limitations of study findings to non-expert readers?
- What is the most effective approach to balancing sample size and study length for nutrition research that involves measuring several biological parameters?
- How can we educate people to become more critical consumers of scientific information?
- What steps can researchers and publishers take to prevent inaccurate or misleading studies from being published?
- How can we strike a balance between accessibility and accuracy in scientific reporting?

# …And I Show You How Deep The Rabbit Hole Goes
*June 2, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/02/and-i-show-you-how-deep-the-rabbit-hole-goes/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The post explores the consequences of taking different colored pills, each representing a different superpower.
- Each superpower comes with unexpected downsides and limitations.
- The post is a satirical take on the popular movie The Matrix.
- The protagonist has the power to see a millisecond into the future, which eventually leads to being able to send messages back to oneself from arbitrarily far into the future.
- A message is sent back informing the protagonist of an impending apocalypse, and tasking them with finding the creator of the black pill that defies the laws of physics.
- The story jumps to different perspectives in different colors, describing encounters with mysterious individuals and involving assassination attempts and the exploration of the galaxy.
- A group of researchers use a mind-reading technology to contact the mind of God, resulting in chaos and death.
- They wake up forty one years later and discover that most of them have died except for three members.
- The survivors form an empire and find a way to use stored negentropy to restart the universe.

Key learnings:
- Sometimes, what we think we want is not necessarily what we need.
- Every action has a consequence, and it's not always clear what those will be.
- The grass may not always be greener on the other side.
- The power to see the future can have unforeseen consequences and can lead to being tasked with daunting responsibilities.
- Information from the future can both help and hinder one's actions in the present.
- The existence of a power that defies the laws of physics raises questions about the nature of reality.
- Using a mind-reading technology to contact an omnipotent being can cause unpredictable outcomes and may result in catastrophe.
- Building an empire requires strong leaders and advisors.
- Accumulating negentropy could be a way to potentially restart the universe.

Key questions:
- How do our desires shape the choices we make?
- Can we ever truly know the consequences of our actions?
- Are superpowers worth the drawbacks that come with them?
- What is the black pill, and how does it have the power to defy the laws of physics?
- Who are the mysterious individuals in the different color narratives, and what is their endgame?
- How does the protagonist handle the responsibility of being tasked with preventing the apocalypse?
- Could the survivors have done anything differently?
- What are the potential unintended consequences of storing negentropy for billions of years?
- Is it possible to safely contact an omnipotent being without catastrophic consequences?

# Against Tulip Subsidies
*June 6, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/06/against-tulip-subsidies/

## Summary
Key ideas
- A kingdom's tradition of using tulips for marriage proposals goes awry when Dutch traders increase the price of tulips and prevent poor people from getting married. 
- American doctors spend eight years in education, including four in medical school, while Irish doctors only spend five years in medical school. However, both produce equally good doctors. 
- The requirement for a college degree in certain professions, such as firefighting and teaching, is unnecessary and puts a heavy financial burden on those pursuing those careers. 
- The cost of universal free college tuition proposed by Bernie Sanders is not feasible, and college education is in a bubble similar to the tulip bubble.

Key learnings
- The increase in the cost of higher education as well as the requirement for a college degree in certain professions is not necessary and puts a financial burden on those who cannot afford it.
- The necessity of a college degree for many professions is a useless tradition turned into a speculation bubble.
- Universal free college tuition is not feasible and would only prevent the education bubble from popping.

Key questions
- Should the government subsidize the cost of higher education or make college education a protected characteristic?
- What is the solution to prevent the education bubble from growing larger?
- What are the consequences of the financial burden faced by people pursuing certain professions?

# Fearful Symmetry
*June 14, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/14/fearful-symmetry/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The social justice and anti-social justice narratives have similarities, such as identifying their enemy as a discredited mid-20th century genocidal philosophy of government and feeling that they are fighting for their right to exist.
- Both movements operate through explosions of outrage and have even converged on the same excuse for what their enemies call "politicizing" neutral territory.
- The narrative of social justice evolved among minority groups living under domination while the anti-social justice attitude is borne out of the fear and hypervigilance that majority groups feel when in social-justice-dominated spaces.
- The language of social justice is often used to dehumanize others and treat them hatefully.
- The author provides examples of how this language has been used in different situations.
- The author discusses the concept of microaggressions and how they can make people feel uncomfortable and disliked.
- Very often, when events provoke a certain level of hypervigilance in someone, that person starts to feel threatened, afraid for their life and, as a consequence, they become paranoid, thinking that a vast conspiracy is after them and they will never be safe;
- In an age where the media faithfully relates and signal-boost threats aimed at different groups, it is easy to get pushed into a total paranoia;
- Although it’s easy to enter a state of hypervigilance, it’s hard to understand why anyone else could possibly be pushed into it despite by-the-numbers safety;
- Once everyone agrees with each other, there’s a chance of getting somewhere.

Key learnings:
- The narratives of social justice and anti-social justice are similar in their nature and motivations, despite representing different groups.
- Work from the social justice and anti-social justice movements can foster more mirror neurons to work with and helps to get a gut-level understanding of both sides of the dynamic.
- The language of social justice can be misused to attack and dehumanize others.
- Insults and microaggressions, even if seemingly small, can have a significant impact on a person's well-being.
- Different groups may have different worries and concerns, and it is important to consider these differences.
- We should avoid seeing requests as a giant conspiracy to discredit and silence us;
- It is important to stop talking about how social justice activism is necessarily a plot to get more political power, or steal resources, or silence dissenting views.

Key questions:
- Are the social justice and anti-social justice movements really similar or is it a case of convergent evolution?
- How can the mirror neuron be harnessed to work with the narratives of social justice and anti-social justice to better understand the interactions of the opposing groups?
- What is the impact of politicizing a neutral territory by both the social justice and anti-social justice groups, and is there an alternative way to address the issue?
- How can we ensure that language used in social justice movements is not misused to attack and dehumanize others?
- Is there a way to distinguish between meaningful criticism of someone's views and hateful attacks?
- How can we address concerns raised by different groups without ignoring or dismissing them?
- Why is it easier to accept statistics about terrorism calmly without feeling personally threatened?
- How can we stop believing that they censor and doxx and fire their opponents out of some innate inability to understand liberalism?
- How can we educate people to listen and understand that our concerns are legitimate and not sparked by a giant conspiracy to discredit and silence them?

# Links 6/15: Monsters, Link
*June 24, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/24/links-615-monsters-link/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Study shows that banning bottled water on campuses doesn't reduce plastic consumption, but makes students switch to bottled soda with no improvement in health.
- Mexican drug cartels have significantly decreased in activity, but scientists believe that this could be due to the break down of cartels into smaller, more disorganized groups
- A systematic review of all 55 medical conditions discovered that there are certain points of the year where risks of specific conditions may increase.
- A new study shows that colleges who provided programs that taught women how to avoid rape saw a 50% reduction in risk.
- An uncommon allele of the MAO-A gene may increase the risk of criminal behavior in people by sevenfold, making it the strongest gene-crime link to date 

Key learnings
- The US may be able to replicate Scandinavia's low poverty rate with a high standard of living and absolute poverty if executed correctly.
- Swedes living in the US and in Sweden share similar poverty rates.
- College professors in California may face punishment for committing 'microaggressions', including simply saying that "I believe the most qualified person should get the job".
- 66% of replication attempts in economics studies fail to completely replicate the original finding.
 
Key questions
- Do probiotics help with anxiety?
- How does an IQ test affect job interviews and how does it fit into the Griggs vs. US ruling?
- Could the US lower crime rates by identifying people with the MAO-A gene?
- Can industries that feature multiracial employees resolve racial gaps in salaries by changing audience perception?
- What does Iceland have to teach the US about fiscal austerity?

# Reflections From The Halfway Point
*June 29, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/29/reflections-from-the-halfway-point/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Psychiatric hospitals are much more orderly than one would think and violence is rare.
- Patients are often admitted for reasons that are not entirely justified by their actual condition, and the system is partially built on the equivalent of security theater.
- Many patients do not find inpatient treatment helpful and their preferences can be difficult to accommodate.
 
Key learnings:
- Residency helps one get used to medical situations and learn to tune out chaotic elements.
- The civilizing instinct is impressive and calmness and authority can usually defuse a potentially volatile situation.
- Patients often have very reasonable preferences in the inpatient setting, but doctors may not be able to fulfill them.
 
Key questions:
- How can psychiatric hospitals better adjust to the preferences and needs of their patients?
- What is the ethical responsibility of doctors in the inpatient setting to provide optimal care?
- How can the mental health system be improved to prevent unnecessary hospitalizations and more effectively treat severe mental illness?

# The Case Of The Famous Physicist
*July 3, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/07/03/the-case-of-the-famous-physicist/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Story of a woman being committed for insisting Obama follows her on Twitter
- The woman was brought in for psychiatric evaluation after a shouting match with police
- The psychiatrist is in a difficult position to decide whether or not to admit someone
- A lot of people in psychiatric care abuse trust

Key learnings:
- Delusions are fixed false beliefs that people believe are true
- Psychiatrists have to err on the side of admitting someone
- Trust is crucial in everyday life, but there are many cases of abuse in psychiatric care

Key questions:
- Was the woman's case as much of an outrage as it was made out to be?
- Why did the hospital not check the link to the woman's employment documents?
- How do psychiatrists determine whether someone should be committed?

# The Argument From Cultural Evolution
*July 7, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/07/07/the-argument-from-cultural-evolution/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Cultural evolution refers to the preservation of useful ideas and tips.
- Two types of cultural evolution are within-culture and between-culture evolution.
- Intracultural evolution can't be used to override people's decisions about whether they're happy doing something or not.

Key learnings
- The first form of cultural evolution, which refers to within-culture evolution, works through a process of natural selection.
- The second form of cultural evolution, which refers to between-culture evolution, is akin to group selectionism.
- The cultural evolution argument for traditional sexuality seems to be trying to argue in the absence of, or in parallel to, observable historical lessons.

Key questions
- What is the difference between the obvious Inuit form of cultural evolution and the non-obvious marriage form?
- How long is a "generation" in cultural evolution?
- What is the extent of the selective advantage conferred by an individual cultural trait?

# Cultural Evolution 2: Thanks For The Meme-Rise
*July 8, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/07/08/cultural-evolution-2-thanks-for-the-meme-rise/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Cultural evolution can happen through a super-innovation that allows one culture to conquer all others or when one group in a society outbreeds another.
- Cultural evolution can happen with subcultures that undergo evolution conforming to population genetic equations in a reasonable amount of time, and spread quickly as people rush to join the attractive ones.
- Cultural evolution can occur by an accretion of things that work and first rituals might have been impromptu celebrations of specific events, but because they helped people bond, people kept doing them.
- Cultural evolution could have occurred way back in prehistory.

Key learnings:
- The potential of cultural evolution to be interesting does not serve as a strong argument for preserving particular features of inherited culture absent other arguments suggesting we know why we want those things to be preserved.

Key questions:
- Can we trust anything that evolved in prehistory to still be relevant?
- Are there historical examples of subcultures that became popular and spread and became dominant/universal?
- Why are religions typically so slow to evolve compared to other cultural phenomena?

# Links 7/15: Link-Carbon Battery
*July 8, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/07/08/links-715-link-carbon-battery/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Schools appear to be assigning harder reading material at an earlier age.
- A study from Finland demonstrates that there is a link between crime and IQ
- Giving poor families money improves children’s outcomes considerably.
- For-profit colleges tend to leave most of their graduates unemployed or working below-poverty-line jobs.
- China increased years of required schooling, leading to new research showing that the labor market return to another year of schooling is very small.

Key learnings
- The US’ private health system is no more or less expected to spend than Europe’s public health systems.
- Genetic factors and childhood trauma both independently increase people’s risk for psychosis.

Key questions
- Does the black-white outcome difference study mean that genetics or discrimination-based explanations are invalid?
- Could volunteering become illegal after a class action lawsuit against AOL?
- Does US healthcare spending truly result in worse outcomes than Europe's public healthcare?
- How large of an effect does giving poor families money have on long-term outcomes?

# Things That Sometimes Work If You Have Anxiety
*July 13, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/07/13/things-that-sometimes-work-if-you-have-anxiety/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Anxiety disorders are common and disabling, but often overlooked and undertreated.
- Diet, exercise, and mindfulness techniques can help reduce anxiety.
- Cognitive-behavioral therapy is effective for anxiety disorders.
- Medications such as SSRIs, SNRIs, benzodiazepines, and antihistamines can also be helpful, but come with risks.
- Atypical antipsychotics are often overused and not recommended for anxiety.
- A good pharmacological treatment algorithm for anxiety disorders
- Alternative treatments like massage therapy, acupuncture, and inositol
- GABA pills, ashwagandha, bacopa, kava, selank, and phenibut as additional options
- No single treatment for anxiety stands out as extremely effective

Key learnings:
- Exercise, breathing techniques, mindfulness, and meditation can all help reduce anxiety.
- Cognitive-behavioral therapy is a recommended first-line treatment for anxiety disorders.
- Medications can be helpful for anxiety, but come with risks of addiction and other side effects.
- Any of “self-help workbook”, “start SSRIs”, or “try l-theanine” are good first options
- Discussing exactly how to use phenibut infrequently and carefully is beyond the scope of the article
- Work with your doctor to find a suitable anxiety treatment

Key questions:
- What is the best way to find a qualified therapist for anxiety treatment?
- How can patients balance the risks and benefits of anxiety medications?
- Are there alternative treatments for anxiety that are effective and safe?
- Can we ingest GABA pills directly to increase GABA levels in the nervous system?
- What are the benefits and risks of taking picamilon as an anxiety treatment?
- How can people deal with anxiety given many factors like lifestyle, medical care access, and side effects of treatments?

# CBT In The Water Supply
*July 16, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/07/16/cbt-in-the-water-supply/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The post discusses two examples of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) from a book called "When Panic Attacks."
- It questions why CBT doesn't seem to work as well in real life as it seems to in the book.
- The post suggests that CBT has become so widely circulated in popular culture that it might have lost its effectiveness in a therapeutic setting.
- Patients might prefer old psychotropic medications because of the placebo effect in psychotherapy.
- The feeling of insights is a common feature among psychotherapies.
- CBT nowadays might seem anticlimactic because of the absorption of its concepts into pop culture.

Key learnings:
- The Pleasure/Perfection Balance Worksheet can help individuals with perfectionist tendencies realize that their self-defeating beliefs are not true.
- The Double-Standard Technique can help people identify and challenge their negative thoughts.
- CBT has become a widespread part of popular culture, but may be losing effectiveness as a formal therapeutic technique.
- The placebo effect might be an important factor in the patient's preference for old psychotropic medications.
- The feeling of insights might be a key component of psychotherapy that contributes to the placebo effect.
- The absorption of psychotherapy concepts and techniques into pop culture may affect the perceived effectiveness of the therapy.

Key questions:
- Why does CBT seem less effective in real-life than it does in the book "When Panic Attacks?"
- Has CBT become so prevalent in popular culture that it has lost its therapeutic value?
- What is the part of psychotherapy that provides the placebo effect?
- Can the lessening of the feeling of insights in modern psychotherapies account for the preference of patients for old psychotropic medications?
- How does the absorption of psychotherapy concepts and techniques into pop culture affect the effectiveness of the therapy?

# Freedom On The Centralized Web
*July 22, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/07/22/freedom-on-the-centralized-web/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Internet communities share many features with real communities, and community leaders have a lot of power over their business.
- A few giant corporations like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Amazon, and PayPal dominate the internet and there is no real competition.
- The preservation of free speech is left up to the market, but there are some issues that the free market cannot solve like racial equality and worker safety.
- Free speech has become a value claimed only by one side of a political argument, leading to it being associated with bad arguments and opposition to demands by the other side.
- Weaponized stereotype campaigns may be used to irrevocably identify an entire online community.
- Reddit has every incentive to cave to such campaigns due to the importance of its brand.
- The worst possible end-game is a two-tier marketplace of ideas with the second tier being inhabited entirely by witches.
- Unpopular ideas may be forced out of the first tier by media smear campaigns.

Key learnings:
- Although the internet was supposed to be a libertarian paradise, a few giant corporations have taken over, and there are no real competitors.
- Private companies do not always preserve freedom of speech, and there is no guarantee that the free market will protect it.
- The association of a value with only one side of a political argument makes it vulnerable to being claimed by the other side as an outgroup signal.
- Online communities may be irrevocably identified by weaponized stereotype campaigns.
- Websites may cave to such campaigns due to the importance of their brand.
- Media smear campaigns may force unpopular ideas out of the first tier of the marketplace of ideas.

Key questions:
- Why did the idea of small corporate states competing on the internet not work, and what can we learn from this?
- Should the government regulate the preservation of free speech online, and if so, how should they do it?
- How can we prevent internet giants from having a monopoly and control over the information ecology?
- What other values are claimed only by one side of a political argument and associated only with bad arguments for the other side?
- What can online communities do to prevent the success of weaponized stereotype campaigns against them?
- How can websites protect their brand without caving to weaponized stereotype campaigns?
- What strategies can be employed to prevent media smear campaigns from forcing unpopular ideas out of the first tier of the marketplace of ideas?

# The General Factor Of Correctness
*July 23, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/07/23/the-general-factor-of-correctness/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- A General Factor of Correctness (GFC) would mean that people who do well on one type of knowledge will do well on other types.
- Identifying the GFC would allow us to know whose theories are right, without having to be experts in any specific field.
- However, the existence of GFC is controversial and difficult to identify because of various factors.
- Economics profession is split between two exclusive economic theories
- A survey in 2005 had found that the majority of Schmoeist and anti-Schmoeist economists believed in pre-Clovis settlement of the New World
- New archaeological finds establish the existence of such settlement
- Controversial questions in archaeology, anthropology, and historical scholarship
- Schmoeists performed better than anti-Schmoeists on 9 out of 10 questions in a survey

Key learnings:
- Calibration can be correlated with opinions on a non-calibration task.
- The same small group of people consistently outperformed everyone else in a way incompatible with chance.
- Scientists may not be wiser than others outside of their specialist field, which raises concerns about trust in their opinions.
- Exclusive economic theories can have varying levels of support from different groups within the field
- New information or evidence can shift the balance of support for a theory
- Survey results can provide insights into the beliefs and knowledge of a particular group

Key questions:
- Is there a difference between correctness and probability calibration?
- Can we differentiate positive from negative selection?
- Can we improve on the "always agree with expert consensus" heuristic?
- Are you just going to rediscover some factor we already know about, like IQ or general-well-educatedness?
- How do you view a split in support for two exclusive economic theories?
- How does new evidence affect your level of support for a particular theory?
- What insights can be gained from survey results in a particular field?

# Non-Dual Awareness
*July 28, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/07/28/non-dual-awareness/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Academia and drug gangs have a similar structure that "dualizes" the field.
- This structure creates binary winners and losers, with a few high-paying positions and many low-paying positions.
- Dualized fields have more inherent risk, opportunity for oppression, and are more likely to become politicized.

Key learnings:
- Dualized fields can create a bottleneck where only a few people obtain high-paying positions, while the majority have no relevant options.
- There is an inherent opportunity for oppression in dualized fields, where superiors control whether one will make it to the top or not, leading to compliance and exploitation.
- Dualized fields offer an opportunity for corruption and politicization, where top positions are considered spoils to be distributed.

Key questions:
- What causes some fields to become dualized and others non-dualized?
- How can privilege be given without creating dualization in a field?
- Are there ways to create systems that become harder to fire or let go of employees, without the need for tenure?

# Stalin and Summary Statistics
*August 2, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/08/02/stalin-and-summary-statistics/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The blog post discusses two studies: one on IQ and income differences among US states, and another on the correlation between wealth and parents' status.
- The post highlights the limitations of summarizing data with correlation coefficients and percent variance explained, which can be misleading.
- The author questions the validity of the adoption study and wonders if the findings only reflect the unusual circumstances of the biological parents.
- The post emphasizes the importance of environment in shaping an individual's financial outcomes.

Key learnings:
- Correlation coefficients and percent variance explained are useful tools, but they can oversimplify complex relationships in data.
- Studies should be interpreted in context and with an understanding of their limitations.
- Environment plays a significant role in determining an individual's financial success.

Key questions:
- How can we better summarize and interpret data without oversimplifying it?
- What are the limitations of adoption studies, and how can we study the correlation between genetics and financial outcomes more accurately?
- How can we design more effective interventions to improve the lives of those with fewer financial opportunities, given the importance of environment in shaping outcomes?

# Contra Hallquist On Scientific Rationality
*August 4, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/08/04/contra-hallquist-on-scientific-rationality/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- I.Topher Hallquist wrote an article criticizing the rationalist community and Less Wrong for being "against scientific rationality" and having "crackpot tendencies".
- Most of the criticisms focus on Eliezer Yudkowsky's beliefs, even though he is no longer the sole leader of the community.
- The author worries that guilt by association may affect the rationalist community and thus addresses Hallquist's criticisms.
- People often hold strong beliefs.
- Wise people don't try to force their beliefs on others.
- Being confident in one's beliefs doesn't mean ignoring peer review or criticism.
- Criticizing someone for having strong beliefs is unfair if they haven't actually said what they're being accused of saying.
- Taubes' argument is that refined carbohydrates are the main cause of weight gain.
- The Clozaril-in-orange-soda model is Taubes' model and is gaining ground among dietary researchers.
- Taubes' claims about government guidelines and high-fructose corn syrup are not unfounded.
- Hallquist misunderstands Taubes' main point in his criticisms.
- Criticizing the flaws in mainstream experts is not enough unless a better alternative is proposed.
- Science is a system of social rules and institutions that enables mortals to make progress on hard questions.
- Yudkowsky's position on the rules of science and the idea of amateurs making faster progress is flawed.
- Developing clear thinking is a learnable skill but requires extensive study and domain-specific knowledge.
- Clear thinking is necessary when dealing with complex problems and making decisions that could affect people's lives.

Key learnings:
- Critiques should be reasonable and fair and not misrepresent individuals, ideas, or communities.
- Disclaimers are not always needed in blog posts or conversations, but it is crucial to acknowledge opposing perspectives and keep an open mind.
- Some problems are complex, and progress in academic fields can be slow, which does not necessarily mean that individuals or communities are irrational.
- It's important to be open to peer review and criticism when expressing beliefs.
- Signing up for cryonics doesn't necessarily mean being overconfident in its success.
- Just because someone believes strongly in something doesn't mean they're unwilling to discuss it and accept feedback.
- The role of refined carbohydrates in weight gain is still up for debate.
- The Clozaril-in-orange-soda model may be a useful way to think about weight gain.
- The government's dietary guidelines may have been flawed in the past.
- Careful reading and fact-checking are important when making criticisms.
- Progress requires hard work and a foundation of domain-specific knowledge.
- Thinking clearly is a valuable but challenging skill that requires extensive education and experience.
- The sequence of developing scientific rationality should be formalized to avoid dismissing true results that are counterintuitive.

Key questions:
- How should critiques be presented to be viewed as reasonable and fair?
- When should disclaimers be added to blog posts or conversations?
- What are some strategies to overcome the challenges posed by complex problems and slow progress in academic fields?
- How should we balance our confidence in our beliefs with the potential for error and the importance of feedback?
- What role does open debate and peer review play in shaping beliefs?
- In what ways can we come to a better understanding of the limits of our own knowledge and fallibility?
- What is the role of refined carbohydrates in weight gain?
- Can the Clozaril-in-orange-soda model help guide dietary research and treatment?
- What should be the focus of government dietary guidelines?
- How can we ensure careful reading and fact-checking in discussions of nutrition and weight loss?
- Is becoming more rational a matter of "wishing away the difficulty"?
- If a person demands answers to semi-impossible questions, how can scientific rationality help?
- How can people evaluate difficult moral and intellectual arguments to reach important conclusions without being perceived as crackpots?

# Links 8/15: A Link In The Armor
*August 7, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/08/07/links-815-a-link-in-the-armor/

## Summary
Key ideas

- Bee populations are recovering faster than they are declining, according to a report by The Washington Post.
- An article on Slate explores over twenty scientific studies on topics ranging from genetics to anti-minimum wage studies.
- A study found test scores are affected by fasting during fetal development, leading to poor brain development and lower test scores as an adult.  Implications are for pregnant mothers to take God's offer to not fast seriously.
- Two studies analyze bullying and sexism in schools, finding that gender and status play a high factor in both cases.
- A study examines hormone levels and how they affect gender differences, showing intelligence is negatively correlated with present-day-testosterone but positively correlated to fetal testosterone.

Key learnings

- Scientists rely on facts and ground truths to help frame their research and subsequent findings.
- Intrauterine factors can permanently harm the brain when developmentally affected by potentially harmful practices.
- Rationality does not appear to have a general factor that shows a high cognitive ability on avoiding one kind of cognitive bias.
- Stories throughout the article show how genetics play a factor in many events and outcomes in both daily lives and longstanding history.

Key questions

- What are the limits on the development of abilities that arise through genetics?
- How can the international community come together to ensure sustainability not only in energy production but in other areas such as food production?
- Can the general factor of fitness improve the health of individuals with an increased resistance to diseases and illnesses?
- With the rise of alternative energy sources, how will it affect fossil fuel production and how can communities be aided to manage their shift from fossil fuels?

# Contrarians, Crackpots, and Consensus
*August 9, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/08/09/contrarians-crackpots-and-consensus/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Gary Taubes' ideas on low-carb diets to solve obesity haven't fared well but some supporting points have been accepted.
- Taubes' ideas were not perfectly novel or perfectly well-known in the 1990s and there was much disagreement at different levels of the scientific community.
- Science journalism and political influence can affect the dissemination of scientific ideas.
- Virtuous contrarians such as Irving Kirsch, Judith Rich Harris, and Nick Bostrom are received more quietly than crackpots.
- People outside the field can offer fresh perspectives, identify new ideas and create new narratives.
- People who overshoot and challenge the field where it is right can get caught in the trap and lose credibility.
- Even when contrarians win, they lose as they will be remembered as partisans of crazy false ideas.
- Contrarians can make contributions by calling attention to certain results in the field.

Key learnings:
- Scientific consensus isn't a monolith, but rather varies at each level of the scientific pyramid.
- Disagreement among scientists does not imply that each viewpoint is equally valid.
- Contrarian ideas from virtuous individuals may be worth considering.
- People outside the field who offer fresh perspectives can add value to a field, but they need to be careful not to oversimplify or go too far in their claims.
- Calling attention to certain results in the field is a valuable contribution, but it needs to be done without attacking the existing paradigm.

Key questions:
- How does enemy action affect the dissemination of scientific ideas?
- Is there a way to distinguish virtuous contrarians from crackpots?

# Book Review: Chronicles Of Wasted Time
*August 11, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/08/11/book-review-chronicles-of-wasted-time/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Malcolm Muggeridge's autobiography Chronicles of Wasted Time depicts his upbringing in a socialist family and his eventual disillusionment with socialism and progressive ideals.
- Muggeridge struggles with a feeling of impending decay and has a tendency to view everything as infested with maggots.
- He becomes a journalist and moves to the USSR, where he realizes that Soviet propaganda is pervasive and his dispatches are heavily censored.
- Muggeridge's experience as a journalist during Stalin's Great Famine and World War II.
- Muggeridge's disgust with the left-leaning Western media's willingness to overlook the atrocities committed by the Soviet Union and only report on their progressive causes.
- Muggeridge's experience as a spy during World War II.
- The author reflects on the philosophy of Malcolm Muggeridge, a writer who believed in seeking "treasure in heaven" rather than trying to fix things on Earth.
- The author discusses Muggeridge's views on the idea of externalizing the kingdom of heaven in a temporal form and how it leads to disaster.
- The author ponders the opposition to trying to fix things on Earth, despite Muggeridge's clear hatred of Stalinism and his efforts to make there be less of it.
- The author delves into his own respect for contrarians and the need to cultivate contrarianism.

Key learnings:
- Muggeridge's personal story highlights the potential pitfalls of blindly subscribing to ideology without questioning its flaws and limitations.
- The power of propaganda and censorship can lead to a narrow and distorted view of reality, both for those within the system and those outside of it.
- The importance of journalistic integrity and telling the truth, even when it's not popular or fashionable.
- The danger of blindly following ideology and dogma, whether it's from the left or the right.
- The importance of maintaining independence and impartiality, even in the face of pressure or persecution.
- Contrarianism is a fragile art that must be kept alive for times when it's vital to stand up against the establishment.
- Cultivating rationality and the art of sifting through evidence is important because there is no royal road to finding the truth.
- Muggeridge's philosophy provided a way to find something divine in the messiness of the world rather than hating it, but his opposition to trying to fix things on Earth is unclear.

Key questions:
- How can individuals balance a healthy skepticism of their beliefs with an openness to new perspectives and ideas?
- What role do media and propaganda play in shaping our understanding of the world, and how can we ensure a more nuanced and accurate portrayal of information?
- How can journalists maintain their integrity and impartiality in the face of pressure from powerful entities, whether it's a government or a media organization?
- What is the line between activism and journalism, and how can journalists ethically engage in causes they believe in?
- How does bias and ideology affect the way we view and report on historical events?
- What is the difference in principle between Muggeridge's views on making changes, like the opposition to Stalinism, and the views of the Communists who hated capitalism?
- How can one differentiate between being gullible and missing out on the truth when examining evidence or expert consensus?
- What can one learn from Muggeridge's philosophy about seeking "treasure in heaven"?

# Stop Adding Zeroes
*August 12, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/08/12/stop-adding-zeroes/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Dylan Matthews criticizes the concept of existential risk and the idea that efforts to reduce it should be prioritized above all other endeavors.
- Matthews argues that the probability values used to support this argument are arbitrary and lack credibility.
- The author argues that Matthews' use of overly small probability values is flawed reasoning, and that he underestimates the potential risks of existential threats.
- The author supports the notion of "trusting the math" in effective altruism and urges readers to consider the implications of ignoring existential risks.

Key learnings
- The argument that efforts to prevent existential risks should be prioritized above other causes rests on the likelihood of such risks occurring; however, this probability is difficult to estimate with any degree of accuracy.
- While it is important to use reason and calculation to guide altruistic efforts, it is also important to recognize the limitations of probability estimates and to be open to updating one's beliefs in response to new evidence.
- It is possible to use intuitive reasoning and mathematical reasoning together to arrive at more informed decisions, but this requires a willingness to engage in self-reflection and to challenge one's assumptions.

Key questions
- What are the potential risks associated with ignoring existential threats? 
- How can we balance the goal of reducing existential risks with other causes, such as animal rights or poverty reduction? 
- What role does intuition play in effective altruism, and how can we use it to complement mathematical reasoning?

# Figure/Ground Illusions
*August 13, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/08/13/figureground-illusions/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Distress of the privileged: privileged groups who lose some privilege can think the system is biased against them.
- EA movement: Dylan Matthews is concerned that AI concerns are taking over the EA movement.
    - Effective altruist survey suggests that overestimation of concern with AI risk.
    - EA Summit has only one event explicitly about AI, and two others more generically x-risk related.
    - The Bay Area AI event got special billing, but not because AI is the only important thing.
    - Global poverty is a primary concern for EA.
- Figure-ground illusion: people can perceive an issue as dominant in a situation where they are given an equal place. 

Key learnings:
- Unpopular ideologies could also experience distress of the privileged.
- Figure-ground illusion can mislead perceptions of dominance.

Key questions:
- What is Dylan Matthews' concern with AI concerns in the EA movement?

# My Id On Defensiveness
*August 15, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/08/15/my-id-on-defensiveness/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- In online debates, people often use negative affect to associate ideas with negativity and evoke a disgust reaction.
- Projective identification can cause groups to become the very thing they are accused of being.
- Negative affect can push groups past an event horizon where their reputations are destroyed forever.
- Negative affect builds up over time and can make a group seem toxic, pushing away establishment members and leaving only extremist members.
- The safest debate partners are those who have already been dismissed by everyone else, and have no power to load negative affect onto others.

Key learnings:
- In online debates, it is important not to let other people load negative affect onto groups.
- There is a right to be vulnerable to attack, which is a necessary precondition for interesting discussion and the exchange of ideas.
- Calling out bad arguments and making insults and mistruths reputationally costly can prevent groups from becoming toxic.

Key questions:
- What can be done to prevent projective identification?
- Can groups ever recover their reputation once they pass the event horizon?
- What are some strategies for combating negative affect in online debates?

# The Goddess of Everything Else
*August 17, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/08/17/the-goddess-of-everything-else-2/

## Summary
Key Ideas:
- The post outlines the symbolism of the Goddess of Cancer and the Goddess of Everything Else, representing Evil and Good, respectively.
- The Goddess of Cancer represents the animalistic desire to kill, consume, multiply, and conquer, while the Goddess of Everything Else represents the desire for beauty, creation, and cooperation.
- The post shows how the two goddesses interact and influence life on Earth, with the Goddess of Cancer causing destruction and the Goddess of Everything Else bringing progress.

Key Learnings:
- The post suggests that Evil is not necessarily sterile, and that Good can mutate and twist.
- The Goddess of Everything Else is devious and subtle in her approach, and finds ways to align herself with the desires of the Goddess of Cancer's creations.
- Progress can be achieved even in the face of destruction, and the pursuit of beauty and cooperation can eventually overcome the desire to kill and conquer.

Key Questions:
- What is the significance of the Goddess of Cancer's left and right hands?
- How does the Goddess of Everything Else manage to align herself with the desires of the Goddess of Cancer's creations?
- Is progress possible without destruction, or are the two inseparable?

# On Overconfidence
*August 20, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/08/20/on-overconfidence/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- People are overconfident in their ability to predict the future course of AI with high accuracy.
- The estimated probability of 1/10,000 offered by some critics of the Global Priorities Project calculator is still overly confident.
- Predicting the future course of AI is notoriously difficult and claims that a certain form of technological progress will not occur have a poor track record of success.
- One-in-a-million confidence levels require a person to be able to write 27 War and Peace-sized books with similar predictions and only have one of the million be wrong.
- Bayesian and frequentist statistics are the same thing, and "one in a million" level certainty translates to "I expect to be wrong on only one of a million statements like this that I make."
- People must learn to privilege hypotheses correctly and avoid making overly confident predictions.
- People tend to be overconfident when assigning probabilities to events.
- Overconfidence can lead to wrong estimates, especially when dealing with "Knightian uncertainty".
- Aumann's Less-Than-Total-Disagreement Theorem proposes that rational agents shouldn't both end up with 99.9% confidence on opposite sides of the same problem.
- A study of history can help mitigate overconfidence by showing how often people have been wrong in the past.
- The saying that "the majority is always wrong" can be interpreted as meaning that in a world where everyone is overconfident, the majority will be wrong about which direction to move the probability distribution in.

Key learnings:
- People should be cautious about making predictions regarding the future course of AI and must avoid being too confident in their predictions.
- A better understanding of formalizations of Occam's Razor is helpful in avoiding making overly confident predictions.
- Be aware of your own overconfidence when assigning probabilities.
- Consider the possibility of being wrong, especially when dealing with Knightian uncertainty.
- Recognize that disagreement with someone who seems similarly intelligent and informed is a reason for caution, not a reason for doubling down.

Key questions:
- Why are people so overconfident when making predictions about the future course of AI?
- How can people learn to privilege hypotheses correctly?
- What is the best way to estimate the likelihood of AI risk, given that predicting the future course of AI is so difficult?
- What are the potential consequences of overconfidence in decision-making?
- How can we improve our ability to assign probabilities accurately?
- What role does disagreement play in mitigating overconfidence?
- How do cognitive biases influence our ability to evaluate the probability of events?

# Probabilities Without Models
*August 24, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/08/24/probabilities-without-models/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Some argue that probability shouldn’t be used without a well-defined model
- The above argument does not hold up in situations where important decisions have to be made without a model
- In real-life, even without a model, decision-makers make probability judgments
- Choosing not to make a choice is also a choice with consequences

Key learnings
- Probability judgments without models are necessary in real-life situations
- Refusing to make probability judgments could lead to consequences just the same as making a choice
- Frame choices in terms of probability to check for overconfidence when making decisions

Key questions
- How can we make probability judgments without a model?
- When should we take risks on low probability outcomes?
- How accurate are probability judgments when made without a model?

# Mysticism and Pattern-Matching
*August 28, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/08/28/mysticism-and-pattern-matching/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The human brain's failures are often much weirder than computer failures.
- Bottom-up processing and top-down processing in pattern-matching are two ways the brain processes information.
- Dysfunction in the top-down pattern-matching system may create hallucinations.
- Paranoia is related to overfunctioning of social pattern-matching.
- Abusing the pattern-matching faculty can lead to mystical experiences.
- The goal is less to find a sacred truth in the object being analyzed and more about strengthening the pattern-matching faculty to discover a beautiful all-encompassing pattern in the universe.

Key learnings
- Hallucinations may be the result of a dysfunctional top-down pattern-matching system.
- Paranoia may be caused by overfunctioning social pattern-matching.
- Strengthening the pattern-matching faculty may lead to mystical experiences.

Key questions
- Why does the top-down pattern-matching system choose certain people and objects?
- Why are mystical experiences linked with a feeling of no time, no space, and no self?
- Why do people with mystical experiences become happier and better adjusted?

# Magic Markers
*August 31, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/08/31/magic-markers/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Niculescu et al claims to have found that biomarkers predict suicide risk with 92% accuracy.
- The study combines clinical prediction instruments with eleven biomarkers to achieve this accuracy, but the author is skeptical.
- The biomarkers only succeed in predicting bipolar ideation but with an AUC of 0.75, while the clinical instruments have nearly as much predictive power.
- A blood test for suicide will never be 100% accurate because suicide is not purely biological.

Key learnings
- A study claiming to identify biomarkers that can predict suicide risk with 92% accuracy is not as effective as it appears.
- Clinical prediction instruments are almost as effective, and the study does not provide evidence that the biomarkers help in predicting risk beyond the performance of these instruments.
- Suicide risk is not purely biological; it is influenced by numerous factors including daily circumstances, making it unlikely that a blood test for suicide will ever be 100% accurate.

Key questions
- Are the claims that biomarkers predict suicide risk with 92% accuracy correct?
- Do the biomarkers add any predictive value beyond the clinical prediction instruments?
- What are the limitations of a blood test for suicide, and why is it unlikely to be 100% accurate?

# Theses On Trump
*September 3, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/09/03/theses-on-trump/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Trump's unexpected durability in the primary elections is attributed to his skill in persuasion and manipulation. 
- Corbyn, the leftist leader in the UK's Labour Party, is expected to win despite his oddball persona and a history of being the object of ridicule. 
- The rise to power of Trump and Corbyn is similar in terms of being initially underestimated by the establishment, gathering momentum and popularity, and being actively opposed by the establishment media. 
- The increasing ideological polarization between the center and the fringe is making it more difficult for politicians to navigate a path between the competing demands of their base and the need to compromise with reality. 

Key learnings
- The author suggests that the rising trend of outsiders winning elections reflects a broader trend of distrust and alienation of voters from the establishment. 
- Voters are attracted to outsiders who signal rejection of the establishment and its values, and who speak their mind without regard for political correctness. 
- The media has conducted Trump's campaign by constantly criticizing him, which paradoxically helps him gather more support among his base. 

Key questions
- Why are outsiders becoming more attractive to voters in recent years? 
- How can politicians balance the competing demands of their base and the need to compromise with reality? 
- What other examples of outsiders in politics can we look at to further illustrate this trend?

# If You Can’t Make Predictions, You’re Still In A Crisis
*September 5, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/09/05/if-you-cant-make-predictions-youre-still-in-a-crisis/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Over 60% of psychology experiments failed to replicate in a recent study
- Failure to replicate is a normal part of how science works 
- Scientists must figure out under what conditions a phenomenon is true
- Publication bias, experimenter effects and statistical malpractice contribute to the replication crisis in psychology

Key learnings:
- Failure to replicate is not necessarily a cause for alarm in science
- Psychology needs to reconcile differences in replication conditions in an informed Bayesian way 
- Claims of scientific understanding in psychology are weaker due to the likelihood of a phenomenon being true only under certain conditions 

Key questions:
- What factors contribute to the failure to replicate in psychology experiments?
- Is it possible to reconcile replication differences in an informative Bayesian way? 
- How can we solve the replication crisis in psychology, and what are we up against?

# Book Review: Manufacturing Consent
*September 11, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/09/11/book-review-manufacturing-consent/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Noam Chomsky and Edward Herman's book Manufacturing Consent claims that the media serves and propagandizes on behalf of powerful societal interests, which control them.
- The book proposes five major mechanisms that lead to media bias towards conservatives despite most journalists' liberal leanings.
- The book also provides case studies of US military interference in Third World countries, showcasing how the media consistently misrepresents facts in ways that flatter the US government.
- The US media often overlooks the atrocities committed by their allies in foreign countries and focuses only on the ones committed by their enemies.
- The US media often covers foreign elections in a biased manner, portraying US allies as democratic while portraying US enemies as undemocratic.
- The US media has a tendency of uncritically accepting anything that discredits US enemies, even when there is little evidence to support the claims.
- Chomsky and Herman acknowledge atrocities in Cambodia, but question their scale and argue there may have been peasant support for the Khmer Rouge
- They have been criticized for denying or doubting other genocides such as the Rwandan and Srebrenica genocides
- C&H's book Manufacturing Consent has issues with bias, but their thesis survives these biases
- C&H's proposed mechanisms of media bias are not perfect tests for their hypothesis
- Their section on "worthy victims" versus "unworthy victims" describes a certain form of media coverage, which also applies to the Ferguson shooting
- The Democratic party represents powerful domestic interests based in the business community.
- Nixon's actions were a scandal in media's standard as it threatened the rights of powerful groups.
- There was no scandal when the FBI revealed that they had been disrupting activities of the Socialist Workers party by illegal break-ins.
- The media's bias isn't pro-Republican, anti-Democrat. Instead, it is pro-a conservative establishment in which both Republicans and Democrats collude.

Key learnings:
- The media's biases do not necessarily favor one political party over the other but instead serve to propagate the interests of powerful elites.
- The media is often complicit in promoting US military interference in Third World countries, leading to atrocities being committed with little criticism.
- The media is not always impartial and can be influenced by political biases.
- One should be careful when reading news stories and should not take them at face value.
- A critical approach to the news is important to develop a well-informed and balanced perspective on world events.
- The issue with C&H's book After the Cataclysm is that they lean towards denialism of the Cambodian genocide
- The authors' ability to shape readers' understanding of complex issues gives them too much power
- When challenging consensus, it's hard to present a convincing narrative without being accused of bias
- The media coverage of "worthy victims" versus "unworthy victims" applies to cases beyond C&H's proposed mechanisms of media bias
- The media enforces conformity with the Overton window against both the right and left flanks.
- Institutional critiques such as the ones presented in the book are commonly dismissed as "conspiracy theories" by establishment commentators.
- The U.S. media allows spirited debate and criticism, as long as they remain within the system of presuppositions and principles that constitute an elite consensus.

Key questions:
- How do the mechanisms proposed by Chomsky and Herman impact media coverage of political events today?
- What can be done to prevent the media from being controlled by powerful societal interests?
- How can we ensure that the media remains impartial and unbiased?
- What is the responsibility of the media in covering foreign events?
- How can we improve our media literacy to discern between biased and impartial reporting?
- What impact does C&H's work have on their credibility as genocide scholars?
- How can journalists and scholars navigate the fine line between presenting facts and shaping public perception?
- Are C&H's proposed mechanisms of media bias still relevant in today's society?
- How can the media better cover victims of all types, rather than just those considered "worthy"?
- How do alignments between class warfare arise, and how do they solve coordination problems without people involved being aware of what they're doing?
- What is the real nature of the system behind media bias, and how can it be explained and understood?

# Cardiologists and Chinese Robbers
*September 16, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/09/16/cardiologists-and-chinese-robbers/

## Summary
Key ideas:

- There have been many cases of cardiologists caught performing dangerous unnecessary surgeries, insurance fraud, kickback schemes, research data falsification conspiracies, sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour
- It takes a special kind of person to be a cardiologist, and these cases are not just due to incentives in the field
- The "Chinese robber fallacy" is where a specific group is criticized for a problem that is present in society at large, and the media can use a similar tactic to make it seem like there is a systemic problem when there might not be

Key learnings:

- Even when there are many examples of a stereotype, that doesn't necessarily make it true, and the media can use this to their advantage to create sensational stories
- It is important to look at data and statistics to determine whether a problem is actually systemic or not, rather than relying solely on anecdotes

Key questions:

- How can we differentiate between actual structural problems within a profession and instances of individual misconduct?
- How can we combat stereotypes and false generalizations in media coverage?
- What responsibility do journalists have in presenting data accurately and avoiding sensationalism?

- Preventing pandemics is an important area that needs more attention.

Key questions:
- Are there any good organizations working on preventing pandemics that accept donations?

# Beware Systemic Change
*September 22, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/09/22/beware-systemic-change/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- "Systemic change" refers to political issues that are "man versus man" conflicts, rather than "man versus nature" ones.
- Traditional charity, such as healing the sick or feeding the hungry, is universally viewed as good or at least neutral; political issues aren't viewed as universal in the same way.
- Effective altruists disagree about whether they should be supporting systemic change or not.
- Pursuing systemic change may be a waste of resources that could be used elsewhere.
- Supporting one side of a man versus man conflict may harm progress towards the goal that both sides seek.
-Effective altruists need to carefully consider the potential risks of systemic change activism, as these types of complex systems can be difficult to navigate and can cause unintended harm.
-The effective altruist movement risks turning off potential recruits by advocating for causes that are controversial or unpopular.
-Effective altruists risk becoming divided over political disagreements, which could tear the movement apart.

Key learnings:
- Effective altruists need to be careful about how they use their resources if they are seeking to bring about change in political conflicts.
- Supporting one side of a political issue may not be effective if it does not convince people who disagree with that side to change their minds.
- There is no easy answer to whether effective altruists should be supporting systemic change, and they need to carefully evaluate the costs and benefits of their choices.
-Effective altruists should focus on well-understood issues with predictable effects, rather than complex and risky systems.
-Effective altruists need to be mindful of the potential effects their advocacy may have on potential recruits and public perception of the movement.
-The effective altruist movement should strive for unity on core issues, but also be open to differing opinions and respectful of political differences.

Key questions:
- How can effective altruists determine whether their resources are being put to the best use possible?
- Is there a way for effective altruists to utilize their resources to promote systemic change without getting bogged down in man versus man conflicts?
- How can effective altruists avoid wasting resources on political causes that will not effectively promote their goals?
-What is the likelihood of systemic change activism causing more harm than good, and how can effective altruists mitigate those risks?
-How can effective altruists advocate for controversial causes without turning off potential recruits or damaging the reputation of the movement?
-How can effective altruists balance the need for unity on core issues with respect for political differences and a willingness to engage in respectful discourse?

# Vegetarianism for Meat-Eaters
*September 23, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/09/23/vegetarianism-for-meat-eaters/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The author believes animals have moral value but still eats meat.
- The author suggests that eating beef instead of chicken dramatically decreases the number of animals being killed for food, and also reduces the overall suffering experienced by animals.
- The author recommends using ethical offsets by donating to animal charities to compensate for the meat that is still eaten.

Key learnings:
- Eating beef instead of chicken can significantly reduce the number of animals that are killed for food.
- Donating to animal charities can offset the harm caused by consuming meat.

Key questions:
- Is it ethical for non-vegetarians to advocate for vegetarianism in others?
- Does the effectiveness of animal-related charities justify offsetting meat consumption through donations rather than becoming vegetarian?
- Do cows have greater moral value than chickens or fish, and if so, does this factor into the moral calculation of meat consumption?

# The Problems With Generic Medications Go Deeper Than One Company
*September 24, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/09/24/the-problems-with-generic-medications-go-deeper-than-one-company/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Generic medications are often priced exorbitantly high as well
- Insurance co-pays can lead to distorted pricing and lack of competition
- FDA regulations make it difficult for competitors to produce generic medications
- Bioequivalence studies and FDA approval can cost millions of dollars and take up to three years
- Small groups can synthesize certain active ingredients in experimental drugs and buy them in bulk for a few dollars per pill

Key learnings
- Generic drug manufacturers cannot produce competitors for older, niche market drugs because of the fixed costs associated with bioequivalence studies, and extremely low demand
- In some cases, monopolies arise from FDA allowing a company to produce an exclusive drug after doing extensive studies on an old public domain drug
- Michigan registers the prices of the drugs through zip codes, allowing comparison and can lead to huge price differences between pharmacies
- Insurance companies and co-pays can play significant roles in inflated drug prices

Key questions
- Why does the FDA require bioequivalence studies on old, public domain drugs?
- How can insurance companies prevent inflated drug prices?
- Can different oversight measures be put in place to lower drug prices?

# Contra Caplan on Mental Illness
*October 7, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/10/07/contra-caplan-on-mental-illness/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Bryan Caplan's 2006 paper argues that economic theory casts doubt on the consensus view of psychiatric disease
- Caplan believes that psychiatric diseases are best modeled as people with unusual preferences, in contrast to physical diseases which are budgetary limitations caused by budget constraints
- He proposes that psychiatry is an inherently political enterprise that works to delegitimize people with unusual preferences
- Caplan argues that instead of considering psychiatric diseases as analogous to physical diseases, all psychiatric diseases should be thought of as within the broad spectrum of normal variation, making them different from physical diseases
- Scott discusses Bryan Caplan's belief that mental disorders and addictions are simply a case of different preferences.
- He argues that this idea is flawed, as it fails to account for the fact that many people with mental disorders and addictions actively want to change their behavior.
- Scott provides examples from his own experience to support this perspective.

Key learnings:
- The preference/budget distinction is a bad way of dealing with anything more complicated than which brand of shampoo to buy
- 95% of outpatient psychiatry patients go to treatment of their own free will; about 50% of inpatient psychiatry patients also go of their own free choice
- The idea that mental disorders and addictions are simply the result of individual preferences is too simplistic.
- Many people with mental disorders and addictions actively want to change their behavior, suggesting that it is not simply a matter of preference.
- Hallucinations and delusions are real symptoms of certain disorders, and cannot be reduced to a matter of preference.

Key questions:
- What is the relevance of Thomas Szasz's ideas about mental illness in modern times?
- Where should the budget/preference dichotomy be drawn in regards to illnesses like ADHD?
- How does the issue of mental illness stigmatization factor into the debate about how to conceptualize psychiatric diseases?
- Is it fair to say that mental disorders and addictions are simply a matter of individual preference?
- What evidence is there to support or contradict Bryan Caplan's perspective?
- How can we better support individuals with mental disorders and addictions who want to change their behavior?

# Against Against Autism Cures
*October 12, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/10/12/against-against-autism-cures/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The autism rights movement defends the right of autistic people to avoid psychiatric care if they don't want it.
- All psychiatric categories contain a range of symptoms, but autism is particularly heterogeneous.
- Autistic children who were institutionalized have suffered from maltreatment, which has led to a skewed view of autism.
- Many autistic people have biological and behavioral issues that prevent them from being independent and happy-go-lucky.
- Many institutions for autistic people are kind of hellish, and some patients have been subject to sexual and physical abuse.
- Autistic people suffer due to their condition and their institutionalization.
- Institutions for the elderly have just as many problems as institutions for autistic people.
- Curing autism would be the most effective way to alleviate the suffering of autistic people and their caretakers.
- Autistic people have unique problem-solving abilities, but this doesn't justify the institutionalization and abuse they often experience.
- Autistic people should be allowed to choose whether or not to seek a cure, but preventing others from seeking a cure is unjust.
- There's a balance between having a wide variety of human experiences and avoiding hellish experiences.
- People have different opinions on where to draw the line when it comes to sacrificing individuality for the greater good.
- The author drew the line somewhere between nerds and severe autism.

Key learnings:
- The autism rights movement has done good work in terms of exposing abuse of autistic people and providing resources to help them and their families.
- Autistic people have a range of symptoms and issues that prevent them from being independent and happy-go-lucky with just one solution.
- Institutionalization of autistic people has been the consequence of maltreatment and desperation of parents.
- Autistic people suffer greatly due to their condition and environment.
- The people and institutions responsible for the care of autistic people need to do a better job of accommodating and supporting them.
- The search for an autism cure is controversial but worth pursuing.
- It's important to consider the impact of our actions on the greater good and the diversity of human experiences.
- We should be cautious about sacrificing too much individuality for the sake of the greater good.

Key questions:
- What is the one percent of the autism movement's philosophy that the author can't be on board with?
- How can doctors and caretakers improve the conditions of autistic people who are physically aggressive, self-injurious, or suicidal?
- What can society do to prevent abusive treatment of autistic people in institutions?
- Should we focus more on fixing systemic issues that contribute to the mistreatment of disabled and elderly people, or on finding cures for their conditions?
- How do we balance the desire to respect the agency of autistic people with the desire to alleviate their suffering?
- What are the implications of genetic engineering for conditions like autism, and what guidelines should we follow when making decisions about gene editing?
- Where do we draw the line between sacrificing individuality for the greater good and preserving diverse human experiences?
- How do we balance the desire for individuality with the desire for a healthy and diverse society?

# It Was You Who Made My Blue Eyes Blue
*October 15, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/10/15/it-was-you-who-made-my-blue-eyes-blue/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The inhabitants of the island have complicated ritual laws to follow, and they use sparkroot to keep track of things like the island size and population.
- Alonzo de Pinzon, a Spanish sailor who was rescued by the inhabitants of the island, triggers a problem by saying that he saw at least one native with blue eyes.
- The problem is that, according to the Tablets of Enku, anyone who knows they have blue eyes must commit suicide at midnight of that night.
- The inhabitants of the island try to come up with a plan to solve the problem without anyone having to commit suicide.
- Five people are stranded on an island due to a storm, and a sailor tells them that at least one of them has blue eyes.
- They all follow a religious taboo that forbids knowing their own eye color.
- After three days, one of them suggests that one person among the five may have heterochromia, making it impossible to confirm that all of them have blue eyes.
- They argue about the probability of this being true, and one of them suggests waiting it out instead of committing suicide at midnight.
- Two of them, Daho and Enuli, decide to vote against sacrificing themselves, and the other two, Ahuja and Bekka, decide to wait it out instead.
- They decide to tell the other two that they all died in the storm and leave the island on their own.
- A group of people on an island worship a Volcano God and perform rituals to keep the God happy.
- The members of the group are atheists and perform the rituals to avoid being thrown into the volcano.
- The group realizes they are all atheists and decide to keep it a secret.

Key learnings:
- The story illustrates the dangers of strict adherence to religious or cultural traditions without question or critical thinking.
- It also highlights the importance of communication and clear thinking in problem-solving.
- Religious taboos can be irrational and do more harm than good.
- Sometimes it's better to question traditions and beliefs rather than blindly following them.
- Desperate situations can bring out the worst in people, causing them to make harsh decisions to survive.
- People sometimes act a certain way, not because they believe in it, but because they fear the consequences of not acting that way.
- It is possible for a group of people to have a common secret without even knowing it.
- People may hide their true beliefs to avoid being discriminated against by others.

Key questions:
- How could the inhabitants of the island have avoided the problem caused by Alonzo de Pinzon's comment?
- Is it ethical to follow strict religious or cultural traditions that involve harming or killing oneself or others?
- How important is critical thinking when it comes to dealing with complex problems and situations?
- What would have happened if they had all decided to wait it out instead of committing suicide?
- Was it ethical for Ahuja and Bekka to lie about the other two's deaths?
- What are the consequences of pretending to believe in something when you really don't?
- Is it possible to form a community without a shared belief system?
- How does fear of consequences affect people's behavior and decision-making?

# Contra Simler on Prestige
*October 21, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/10/21/contra-simler-on-prestige/

## Summary
Key ideas:
-Status theories don't predict behavior as well as hoped.
-Social status can be separated into two systems: dominance and prestige.
-The evolutionary origins of prestige and admiration still need further explanation.
-Prestigious people can potentially do good things for their flatterers in particular.
- Prestige is a complex concept that combines several different factors.
- Group signaling, coattail riding, prestige by association, tit for tat, and virtuous cycles all play a role in prestige.
- Prestige provides opportunities for bonding and alliance building, as well as personal validation.

Key learnings:
-Dominance and prestige have different origins and different effects on behavior.
-Prestige can be a more effective motivator than dominance in certain situations.
-Prestige can be achieved by doing good things for one's community and for one's flatterers.
- People may admire and seek out association with prestigious individuals for different reasons.
- Prestige can be used as a way to signal personality traits and interests to others.
- The desire for prestige may create virtuous cycles of association with prestigious individuals.

Key questions:
-What accounts for the evolution of prestige in animals and humans?
-How does social status impact behavior and decision-making in different contexts?
-Can the competitive nature of prestige-seeking be harnessed for positive outcomes?
- Can we separate dominance and prestige in understanding social hierarchies?
- What evolutionary origins underpin feelings of admiration for different types of prestigious individuals?
- How does the desire for prestige impact social interactions in both positive and negative ways?

# A Whiter Shade of Candidate
*October 23, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/10/23/a-whiter-shade-of-candidate/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Although most media outlets suggest that Donald Trump's supporters are primarily white, data suggests that they are about as diverse as any other Republican candidate's supporters.
- Bernie Sanders has significantly less support from nonwhite voters than Hillary Clinton, while Donald Trump actually does surprisingly well with some nonwhite demographics.
- The current election aligns the splits within the Democratic Party, with Sanders' supporters generally being wealthy and educated while Clinton's support comes from the social justice activists, nonwhites, and poor.

Key learnings
- Polling data suggests that Donald Trump's supporters are just as diverse as any other Republican candidate's, disproving the media's narrative that Trump has a special appeal to white voters.
- Bernie Sanders' strength among white voters is not reflected among nonwhite voters, with Clinton having overwhelming support from this demographic.
- It's important to use precise definitions when categorizing people by race or ethnicity, as "white" can have different meanings in different contexts.
 
Key questions
- What will happen to the Democratic Party if Sanders wins the nomination but struggles to gain support from nonwhite voters in the general election?
- To what extent do media narratives affect public perceptions of political candidates, and how much weight should be given to polling data?
- Is there a correlation between a candidate's "weirdness" or lack of mainstream appeal and their level of support from nonwhite voters?

# Contra Huemer On Morals
*October 27, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/10/27/contra-huemer-on-morals/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Huemer believes in objective moral truths, and that there has been a coherent ethical perspective emerging over the past few centuries.
- Western values have converged on certain coherent values that are related to civil liberties and individual rights.
- Hanson argues that the direction of causation is mostly from wealth to certain value factors, such as civil liberties and individual rights.
-Technology has connected the world and led to a mixing of different races, cultures, and ideas
-The advancement of technology has made values like tolerance and freedom of thought more relevant
-The Care/Harm and Fairness foundations of morality seem as relevant as ever

Key learnings:
- The emergence of certain coherent ethical perspectives over time may suggest the existence of objective moral truths.
- Western values have converged on certain values related to civil liberties and individual rights, which may also suggest objective moral truths.
- The relationship between wealth and certain value factors, such as civil liberties and individual rights, may indicate that these values are not objective moral truths, but rather are pragmatic responses to changing material conditions.
-Advances in journalism, communication, and art have given us the ability to learn and appreciate the struggles of others in a way we never have before
-Not torturing people and solving poverty are important issues to consider
-Morality might be subjective, and one axis of morality has always been dominant

Key questions:
- Is there evidence for other civilizations converging on similar ethical perspectives to those that have emerged in the West?
- How significant is the correlation between wealth and certain value factors, such as civil liberties and individual rights?
- Do pragmatic responses to changing material conditions count as objective moral truths?
-What about trying to solve poverty and not torturing people?
-Maybe Care/Harm is the fundamental moral foundation, and the other foundations are epiphenomena to be abandoned as we outgrow them?
-What does the saying "The last enemy to be destroyed is submaximal global utility; destroying Death just buys us more time" mean?

# Meat Your Doom
*October 28, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/10/28/meat-your-doom/

## Summary
Key Ideas:
- People often misinterpret the results of studies.
- David Spiegelhalter, a Risk Professor from the University of Cambridge, argues that 'one extra case of bowel cancer in 100 lifetime bacon-eaters' is a better way to convey risk than using relative risk.
- Mortality rates, despite being very important, are much more complicated and result in very tiny differences that barely affect the underlying distribution. 

Key Learnings:
- Absolute risk should be used instead of relative risk to provide a better understanding of how worried you should be.
- A serving of meat costs an average of one minute of life, which is tiny compared to how much time is spent cooking and preparing it.
- Very few people die when they're young, so large changes in mortality barely affect the underlying distribution.

Key Questions:
- Can we quantify risk better when it comes to eating meat?
- How do you measure mortality rates? 
- Should people sacrifice an hour to have a bacon sandwich?

# What Developmental Milestones Are You Missing?
*November 3, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/11/03/what-developmental-milestones-are-you-missing/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Developmental psychology describes how children go from helpless infants to reasonable adults through cognitive development. 
- Less than half of the people in modern western countries have attained Kegan’s fourth stage of moral development, and only a small handful attained his fifth.
- Mental operations considered as developmental milestones include theory of mind, self-environment distinction, probabilistic thinking, and understanding trade-offs.

Key learnings:
- Development is not a matter of certain innate abilities like walking unfolding at the right time, but about difficult mental operations that one either learns or doesn't.
- People have different mind designs that influence their beliefs, judgments and opinions. It's important to understand this to get along with others and maintain boundaries/preferences.
- Rationality and psychotherapy both aim to cultivate mental operations that expand one's cognitive abilities, including distinguishing "the things my brain tells me" from "reality" and thinking probabilistically.

Key questions:
- Are there any basic mental operations that the author still doesn't have, and how would they recognize them and learn them once they do?
- How can the insight that people have different mind designs be used to help break certain people out of their egocentrism and teach them how to deal with other humans?

# Looking A Gift Horse In The Mouth
*November 9, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/11/09/looking-a-gift-horse-in-the-mouth/

## Summary
Key ideas

- The author started criticizing social justice in 2010.
- Social justice criticism is now present in big national media.
- The author is uncomfortable with the sudden outpouring of support for their position.
- The media is over-representing an insular demographic of Ivy League academics who don't notice things that don't affect them personally.
- The author worries that social justice criticism is being defined by rhetorically-gifted Yale professors who will take over the wider movement.
- The mass media seems to be defending Yale administrators and attacking activists for being weak rather than pointing out when they abuse their power.
- The author thinks people should use better arguments about trigger warnings and safe spaces.

Key learnings

- Social justice criticism has entered the mainstream.
- Criticizing social justice can be done from several angles.
- The media's representation of social justice criticism may be incomplete and biased.

- What risks does the wider social justice criticism movement face as it becomes more mainstream?
- How can criticism of social justice be done effectively and constructively?
- Are there better ways to prioritize initiatives to address social problems?

# College And Critical Thinking
*November 30, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/11/30/college-and-critical-thinking/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Critical thinking is the ability to score highly on the Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal.
- Many studies that attempt to measure the effects of college on critical thinking skills lack control groups.
- There are two studies with moderately good designs:  one study follows 30 college students and 17 non-college students, and the second study compares full-time and part-time college students.
- Some studies suggest that most of the gains in critical thinking skills in college happen in the first year.
- Studying a lot and reading unassigned books seems to help develop critical thinking.
- Relationships with competitive and uninvolved peer groups are more likely to show gains in critical thinking than supportive and belonging ones.

Key learnings
- People will gain critical thinking skills during the four years from age 18 to age 22.
- College helps a little with critical thinking skills, and there are dose-dependent effects of college.
- The effect sizes range from modest to appreciable.
- It is difficult to interpret whether the effect of college on critical thinking is real, as confounding variables persist.

Key questions
- What is critical thinking?
- What study designs exist to measure the effect of college on critical thinking?
- Do the effects of college on critical thinking last, or do they diminish over time?
- What are the specific aspects of the college experience that enhance critical thinking development?

# Setting The Default
*December 1, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/12/01/setting-the-default/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Adam wants to go to a fetish club, but Steve does not want him to go.
- Adam suggests doing it with Steve's knowledge and consent, which Steve disagrees with.
- The couple seeks therapy, but therapy has "therapeutic neutrality", so the author needs to decide what advice he would give as a friend.
- The situation is a zero-sum game and there is no way for both to be happy.
- The author realizes that his biases come from his culture's subculture.
- Culture warriors and activists have a point; the sovereign sets the null hypothesis.

Key learnings
- In some situations, the tiebreaker vote is cast by the culture around them.
- Culture sets the default hypothesis, which influences the decision.
- Therapy needs to have therapeutic neutrality, but friends do not face the same limitations.

Key questions
- How do you decide which side to choose if the tiebreaker vote is cast by the culture around them?
- Can therapy still be effective if it has therapeutic neutrality, but culture sets the default hypothesis?
- How much should cultural norms influence personal relationships and individual preferences?

# Book Review: Hive Mind
*December 8, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/12/08/book-review-hive-mind/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Garett Jones' Hive Mind proposes that a nation's IQ matters more than an individual's IQ in determining success
- IQ, time preference, and experimentally induced measures of cooperation predict national success
- High-IQ societies are better able to work on complicated projects
- High-IQ people are more likely to vote for rational policies
- Immigration may have an effect on a high-skill nation's government institutions
- National IQ and national income are strongly correlated, and IQ differences among individuals aggregated in a society explain the effect.
- Reverse causation must be taken into account to understand how IQ affects development: does IQ drive development or does development lead to higher IQ?
- The book assumes that shrewd cooperation is the optimal long-term strategy, but Jones fails to explain how it works in a country.
- Cognitive skills matter more in the elites than in the average population for predicting institutional quality.

Key learnings:
- National IQ correlates with a country's success
- High-IQ societies benefit from complex projects and cooperation
- A high-IQ populace correlates with rational policies
- The relationship between IQ and development is complex and cannot be reduced to a simple unidirectional causal relationship.
- Reliance on national IQ to explain income differences between countries may be misguided, as it is more complicated than aggregated personal IQ.
- Factors such as government corruption, the lack of institutions, and low levels of trust may hinder the cognitive elites from generating the positive effects of higher IQ.

Key questions:
- Why does IQ matter more on a national level than on an individual level?
- How can countries encourage a rise in national IQ?
- Will less-skilled immigrants vote for policies that will weaken the opportunities of high-skill nations?
- How do we know the direction of causation between IQ and development: IQ to development or development to IQ?
- How can the idea of shrewd cooperation in a society be extended beyond iterated prisoners' dilemmas?
- How does the IQ of the population compare with the IQ of the government in its effects on economic development?

# Links 12/15: Ma’oz Tz-URL
*December 8, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/12/08/links-1215-maoz-tz-url/

## Summary
Key ideas 
- Mapping modern concepts of “right” and “left” onto the 1700s’ Federalist and Democratic-Republican parties shows there’s not a clear line between them.
- Blowback theory – the belief that the West’s harsh response to terrorism is encouraging more terrorism – does not have strong research support.
- The “21 Bitcoin Computer” is expensive and impractical, but supporters argue it’s the future.
- Israeli Jews have a high fertility rate, even among secular Jews, and it’s not fully understood why.
- Jacobin Magazine’s “Real Utopias” argues that creating non-capitalist institutions to replace capitalism is better than advocating for revolution.

Key learnings 
- There is no clear line between modern “right” and “left” and the 1700s’ Federalist and Democratic-Republican parties.
- Blowback theory is not well-supported by research.
- The “21 Bitcoin Computer” may not be practical, but some think it is the future.
- Israeli Jews have a high fertility rate compared to other developed countries.
- Replacing capitalism may be more effective than advocating for revolution.

Key questions 
- Can we identify the Federalist and Democratic-Republican parties as the “good guys” with the perspective of history?
- Why do Israeli Jews have such a high fertility rate compared to secular Jewish Americans?
- Is it better to create non-capitalist institutions to replace capitalism than to advocate for revolution?

# List Of Passages I Highlighted In My Copy Of “Hive Mind”
*December 10, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/12/10/list-of-passages-i-highlighted-in-my-copy-of-hive-mind/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Unwritten peace treaties were created between German and French soldiers in WWI, based on the tit-for-tat strategy, allowing for stretches of peace on the Western front.
- IQ tests often involve little paper-staring and can predict outcomes in the workforce and practical social skills.
- Evidence is mixed on whether peer effects in the classroom lead to positive or negative effects on test scores, but disruptive students consistently hurt learning.
- Lead was eliminated from gasoline in sub-Saharan Africa in 2006.
- Smart pairs of players were five times more cooperative in a repeated prisoner's dilemma game than smart individuals.
- The Asch conformity effect does not apply to the Deliberative Poll setting for polarizing political issues.
- Team success on multiple tasks is predicted by taking turns speaking and reading emotions of others.
- Individual IQ differences explained over one third of differences in team performance.

Key learnings:
- Unwritten rules and cooperation can create peace even in times of war.
- IQ tests can be a useful predictor of practical social skills and job performance, and structured job interviews can be effective.
- Peer effects in the classroom are ambiguous at best, but disruptive students consistently harm learning.
- Lead was a major issue in sub-Saharan Africa and has only recently been eliminated.
- Smart pairs of players are more likely to cooperate in a repeated prisoner's dilemma game than smart individuals.
- Short discussions might not change individuals' opinions on polarizing political issues.
- Taking turns speaking and reading emotions of others are essential aspects for team success.
- An individual's IQ can influence the team's performance.

Key questions:
- How can education best improve both fluid and crystallized intelligence?
- Why do sub-Saharan African IQ scores vary so greatly depending on the study and what are the potential implications of this?
- How can we learn more about the relationship between IQ and political behavior and what factors may impact this relationship?
- What can we learn from the absence of conformity in political discussion groups studied by Notre Dame political scientists?
- How can we effectively change individuals' opinions on polarizing political issues?
- Can reading emotions and taking turns speaking be trained in individuals who struggle with these skills?
- How can team performance be improved beyond individual IQ differences?

# Should AI Be Open?
*December 17, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/12/17/should-ai-be-open/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- A hypothetical scenario in which the intellectual elites pool their resources in the 1920s to create nukes that don't require uranium and end up destroying the world.
- OpenAI, a non-profit organization co-chaired by Elon Musk and Sam Altman, is dedicated to advancing digital intelligence for the betterment of humanity.
- The AI risk can be categorized into two aspects: Who will ultimately control the AI? And will the superintelligent AI be willing to follow human instructions?
- In this blog post, Scott argues against OpenAI's decision to make their artificial intelligence software open source.
- He believes that open-sourcing AI can pose significant risks to the safety of human race.
- He highlights the possible dangers of superhuman AIs and questions the benefits of open-sourcing AI.
- Scott explains that AI can be monopolized by one company and become necessary for almost every computing application like Microsoft Windows but it does not require giving away the software.

Key learnings:
- The development of AI can lead to a hard takeoff, which makes OpenAI's strategy less useful.
- Open-sourcing AI findings poses a risk of allowing the most careless person to determine the speed of AI research.
- Open sourcing AI can pose significant risks by giving way to the creation of superhuman AIs that can hurl everybody off the cliffs.
- OpenAI needs to make a strong case for why they are taking the risk to create better safety against people trying to exploit control over AIs.
- Rich people being able to afford premium versions of things weighs less on the scale than “human race likely destroyed”.
- OpenAI project seems more like an act of desperation where safety research can take place by getting the cooperation of the academic and open-source community.

Key questions:
- Will multiple AIs or a single entity be better for advancing AI research?
- How can we ensure that AIs, especially those with superhuman intelligence, will follow human values and instructions?
- What can we do to prevent careless people from taking advantage of open-sourced AI findings?
- How will AI be used in the future?
- Are AIs fast and dangerous or slow and easily-controlled?
- Does just one company have them? Several companies? All rich people?
- Is it hard for rich people to weigh “rich people get premium versions of things” on the same scale as “human race likely destroyed”?
- What was the need for OpenAI to make AI open source?

# How Bad Are Things?
*December 24, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/12/24/how-bad-are-things/

## Summary
Key ideas

- As a psychiatrist, working with people who are miserable and struggling is a daily occurrence, even in wealthy and optimistic American towns.
- Psychiatrists filter for misery and that theoretically makes them more prone to it.
- People automatically have a bias to avoid those who are not like themselves.
- The world has far more pain and suffering than we acknowledge or even imagine.

Key learnings

- Psychiatrists generally treat people who are suffering at the most extreme level of the spectrum.
- The normal way of filtering the people that one meets in life makes it unlikely that one knows people with views that are vastly different from one's own.
- Poll findings show that most people do not understand how many people are genuinely suffering.

Key questions

- Are people biased to filter their social circle based on socioeconomic status?
- Is it possible for individuals to become aware of the extent of pain and suffering in the world and remain mentally healthy?

# Things That Are Not Superintelligences
*December 27, 2015*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/12/27/things-that-are-not-superintelligences/

## Summary
Key ideas
- There is a distinction between collective intelligences and genuine superintelligence.
- Teams, corporations, and cultures have a lot of advantages over individuals, but they cannot simulate aspects of intelligence regarding creative problem-solving ability.

Key learnings
- A team of people smart enough to solve problems up to Level N may be able to work in parallel to solve many more Level N problems in a given amount of time, but it won’t be able to solve Level N+1 problems.
- Even if all of the problems were magically solved of teams, corporations, and cultures, it still leaves the fundamental problem where no organization of chimpanzees will ever write a novel.

Key questions
- Why do people think corporations, bureaucracies, teams, civilizations, and mind-mapping software are superintelligent AIs?
- What is the distinction between collective intelligences and genuine superintelligence?
- How do collective intelligences compare to an individual's intelligence in terms of creative problem-solving ability?

# Guns And States
*January 6, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/01/06/guns-and-states/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Vox article suggests a correlation between gun ownership and gun deaths, but fails to differentiate between gun homicides and gun suicides.
- Robert VerBruggen and the Washington Examiner criticizes Vox’s flawed statistics.
- Studies by the Harvard Injury Control Research Center show a correlation between gun ownership and gun homicides, but not non-gun homicides.
- Rural and Southern areas have higher gun ownership rates but lower homicide rates.
- America’s high murder rate is not solely due to high gun ownership, but also possibly due to a “culture of violence.”
- Scatterplots showing raw correlations between gun ownership and “gun deaths” are entirely driven by suicide
- Adjusting for all relevant confounders, there is a positive correlation between gun ownership and homicide rates
- The majority of the difference between America’s murder rate and that of other First World countries is not because of easier access to guns in America
- Some of the difference is due to easier access to guns, estimated to be around 0.5 murders per 100,000 people per year.
- An Australian-style gun control program that worked and had no side effects would probably prevent about 2,000 murders in the US
- The amount of lost gun-related enjoyment an Australian-style gun control program would cause may not outweigh the benefits

Key learnings:
- Gun deaths are a combined measure of gun homicides and gun suicides.
- Always differentiate between gun homicides and gun suicides to draw accurate conclusions.
- Misleading statistics can be used to push a certain narrative or agenda; always question the data and methodology used.
- A “culture of violence” may be a factor in America’s high murder rate.
- The correlation between gun ownership and homicide rates is likely causal.
- Easier access to guns is not the primary reason for the US's higher murder rate.
- Australian-style gun control may be a good idea for the US.

Key questions:
- Why do Vox and other news outlets use misleading statistics to make a point?
- How can we differentiate between gun homicides and gun suicides in studies on gun violence?
- What other factors besides gun ownership contribute to America’s high murder rate?
- Is experimental evidence needed to form strong opinions on gun control?
- Can the benefits of preventing murders and suicides from guns outweigh the loss of gun-related enjoyment for some people?

# Guns and States 2: Son of a Gun
*January 10, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/01/10/guns-and-states-2-son-of-a-gun/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Guns alone are not the cause of violence; cultural factors are responsible for the difference in homicide rates between different countries.
- The correlation between the gun homicide rate and robbery is strong, but rape's correlation with gun ownership is puzzling.
- The degree of gun ownership in European and Anglosphere countries suggests that gun control can mean something less extreme than confiscation.

Key learnings:
- Cultural factors play a major role in determining the impact of guns on violence.
- Analysis of crime patterns is complex and requires consideration of various factors.
- Gun ownership rates in other countries should guide expectations for effective gun control measures.

Key questions:
- What role do cultural factors play in determining patterns of gun violence?
- How can we develop effective gun control measures while protecting the right to bear arms?
- How can guns be best used to protect against tyrannical government?

# Schizophrenia: No Smoking Gun
*January 11, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/01/11/schizophrenia-no-smoking-gun/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- 60-80% of schizophrenics smoke compared to 20% of the general population
- The cause for this is still unclear
- Genetics related to nicotine receptors may be involved
- Schizophrenic patients smoke to supplement the failed nicotine system in their brain and feel better

Key learnings:
- Smoking potentially prevents schizophrenia rather than causing it
- Second study showed that without confounders, smokers were more likely to get schizophrenia, but once adjusted for confounders, smokers are less likely
- Controlling for fewer things does not provide better data

Key questions:
- Why do schizophrenics smoke?
- Does smoking cause schizophrenia, or prevent it?
- What is the reason for conflicting evidence on whether smoking increases or decreases the risk of schizophrenia?

# Lies, Damned Lies, And The Media (Part 6 of ∞)
*January 15, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/01/15/lies-damned-lies-and-the-media-part-6-of-%e2%88%9e/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Breitbart's article "Rape Deniers: 9 Facts About Illegal Alien Crime The Media Covers Up" uses statistics to show that illegal immigrants to the United States are involved in a lot of crime, especially sexual crime.
- The article argues that immigrant-heavy areas have disproportionate amounts of crime that represent the country's entire crime load as a whole.
- Breitbart's statistics are flawed and do not give meaningful information.

Key learnings
- The use of statistics in news articles can be misleading and is misused in both liberal and conservative news sources.
- It is important to practice Gettier politics and understand that both sides are capable of spreading lies and misconceptions.
- The fallacy of assuming the other side is decent and intellectually honest is an obstacle to changing one's mind.

Key questions
- What are some examples of misleading statistics used in liberal news sources?
- How can we better understand and approach conversations with those who hold opposing viewpoints?
- What are some suggested ways to counteract the spread of misinformation in news articles?

# Side Effects May Include Anything
*January 20, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/01/20/side-effects-may-include-anything/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Patients often search the internet for information on the adverse effects of drugs.
- Unreliable websites such as EHealthMe, PatientsVille, and Treato tend to generate fake medical information.
- Sites such as EHealthMe scrape the FDA databases to find information on possible side effects and run a program to produce ad-filled web pages about the drug.
- A lot of the time, people stop taking medication because of side effects, which can be hard for doctors to manage.

Key learnings:
- The reliability of information on the internet about drug side effects should be questioned.
- As much as possible, patients should seek advice from medical professionals before stopping medication due to side effects.
- Patients should be informed about the availability of mental and emotional support and resources to cope with the side effects of medication.

Key questions:
- How can we ensure that patients have access to reliable medical information about the side effects of drugs?
- What impact do unreliable medical websites have on the credibility of medical research?
- Do patients have the necessary knowledge to differentiate between reliable medical information and fake medical information?

# Staying Classy
*January 30, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/01/30/staying-classy/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Social class is more than just economic class and involves factors like education, family background, and respectability.
- Different classes have distinct cultures, behaviors, and values.
- Talking about class is taboo in America, where people often confuse class with income.
- Class prejudice combines practical superiority with a dubious belief in the superiority of upper-class culture.
- College serves as a finishing school for the upper classes to learn proper values and behaviors.
- Classes are broken down into the underclass, labor, gentry, elite, and E1 (the worst psychopaths).
- Elites control everything and use division tactics to pit the middle and lower classes against each other.
- Different class systems have different cutoffs and political perspectives, but there are underlying similarities between them.
- Income is a poorly measured outcome and analyzing class would be more interesting.
- The Right thinks in social class terms more naturally than the Left.
- Donald Trump appeals to people because he seems to be from the Labor class.
- The thesis of "I Can Tolerate Anything But The Outgroup" simplifies to "It is a Gentry-class tradition to sweep aside all prejudices except class prejudice, which must be held with the intensity of all the old prejudices combined."
- The Grey Tribe doesn't fit easily into the class hierarchy and other factors can be stronger than class in some groups.
- The author tries to explain their own classism and justifies it as certain qualities and behaviors are associated with different classes.
- Cellular automaton theory of fashion likely relevant.
- College is a finishing school for the upper classes.

Key learnings:
- Social class is a complicated and multifaceted concept that cannot be reduced to income alone.
- Class influences one's culture, values, and behavior, and limits social mobility.
- Class prejudice combines practical advantages with questionable beliefs in superiority.
- Elite control everything and use division tactics to maintain their power.
- Different class systems have underlying similarities and cutoffs, but may have different political perspectives.
- Analyzing class would be more interesting than income.
- The Right thinks in social class terms more naturally than the Left.
- Donald Trump appeals to people because he seems to be from the Labor class.
- Class prejudice is intense and prevalent in Gentry class tradition.
- Other factors can be stronger than class in defining a group.
- Certain behaviors and qualities are associated with different classes.
- Cellular automaton theory of fashion could explain the trends in fashion.
- College is a finishing school for the upper classes.

Key questions:
- How can we break down class barriers and provide greater social mobility?
- Why is there such a taboo around talking about class in America?
- How can we combat division tactics used by the elite to keep the middle and lower classes against each other?
- How do stereotypes about different classes limit our understanding and social mobility?
- Are studies on class more accurate and comprehensive than on income, and why?
- How does race interact with class?
- What are the other factors that can be stronger than class in defining a group?
- Is classism justified in certain situations, and why?
- How does cellular automaton theory of fashion relate to class?
- How typical is Siderea's experience of college and class culture?

# Book Review: Superforecasting
*February 4, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/02/04/book-review-superforecasting/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Philip Tetlock's Expert Political Judgment experiment found that top pundits had no better accuracy than random chance, except for a few called "superforecasters."
- The Good Judgment Program was created to find the best forecasters in the world, and the top 2% were named "superforecasters."
- Superforecasters are not necessarily smarter or better-informed than others, but excel in their ability to understand logic and probability, and to challenge their own perceptions.
- They use specific techniques for forecasting, such as numerical probability estimates, breaking problems down into smaller pieces, and actively fighting cognitive biases.

Key learnings:
- Superforecasters are not a specific phenomenon, but rather a result of understanding logic and probability and challenging one's own perceptions.
- Numerical probability estimates, breaking problems down into pieces, and fighting cognitive biases are effective techniques for successful forecasting.

Key questions:
- What separates the top 2% of forecasters from the rest?
- How can we distinguish between hedgehogs and foxes in terms of forecasting styles?
- Can the techniques used by superforecasters be taught or learned by others?

# List Of Passages I Highlighted In My Copy Of “Superforecasting”
*February 7, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/02/07/list-of-passages-i-highlighted-in-my-copy-of-superforecasting/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Good Judgment Project outperformed its competitors, including academic institutions and professional intelligence analysts, in predicting events.
- Evidence-based medicine did not necessarily result in rapid advances in medicine.
- Meta-level principles of experts can be sculpted around what best supports their opinions.
- The use of vague language can lead to misunderstandings and inaccurate predictions.
- Superforecasters are not necessarily vastly more intelligent than regular forecasters.
- Second estimates made after considering why one's initial judgment might be wrong can improve accuracy.
- The CIA's use of probability is criticized for disguising uncertainty rather than providing useful information.
- People's intuitive idea of probability is hopelessly confused, and even President Obama had issues with it.
- Superforecasters who use a finer-grained approach to forecasting are more accurate than those who use coarser scales.
- Experts often remember their estimates incorrectly and in a more exaggerated manner.
- Good teams are effective when low-level members are given leeway to question and challenge their higher-ups.
- The humility required for good judgement is intellectual humility, not self-doubt, and can be combined with confidence in one's abilities for fruitful results.
- Smart, dedicated people can inoculate themselves against cognitive illusions.

Key learnings:
- Concentrating on the best people may be more effective than using "straightforward wisdom of crowds" methods.
- A tutorial covering some basic concepts can improve accuracy by 10% at little cost.
- Using diversity as a criterion when selecting what to read next can help avoid being influenced solely by like-minded sources.
- The use of probability can be problematic and disguise uncertainty rather than clarify it.
- People's intuitive idea of probability is often confused, and a more fine-grained approach can increase accuracy.
- Experts tend to remember their estimates as being bolder than they actually were.
- Organizations benefit from recruiting and training talented people who are able to resist biases.

Key questions:
- What were the other teams in the Good Judgment Project's competition doing?
- Can evidence-based medicine retard progress?
- How can adversarial collaboration help establish consistent meta-level principles?
- What can be done to avoid misunderstandings caused by vague language?
- Why are superforecasters not vastly more intelligent than regular forecasters?
- How effective would the "imagine that the marriage failed" approach be in predicting marital success?
- What did Obama mean when he said "this is fifty-fifty" in regards to estimating the probability of a situation?
- How does granularity predict accuracy in forecasting?
- Why do organizations benefit from recruiting and training people who can resist biases?
- How can people inoculate themselves against cognitive illusions?

# Before You Get Too Excited About That GitHub Study…
*February 12, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/02/12/before-you-get-too-excited-about-that-github-study/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Study on gender bias on pull request acceptance in open source projects was not peer-reviewed and conducted by undergraduate students.
- Women actually get more pull requests accepted than men in the top ten programming languages.
- Revealing a contributor's gender usually gives women a small advantage in pull request acceptance.
- Men and women's acceptance rates decrease when gender is revealed, but women's rates decrease more than men's (though it's unclear if the difference is statistically significant).
- Lower acceptance rates for women appear to mainly come from other women's rejections.

Key learnings:
- The media can easily twist research findings without proper evaluation and investigation.
- Not all studies are peer-reviewed, and some may not have enough data analysis to support their conclusions.

Key questions:
- Why did the study not provide a study-wide analysis and account for possible confounders?
- What would happen if the study provided all numbers for their graphs and data?
- How can the scientific community work towards peer-reviewing research findings and educating the general public about proper journalism standards?

# Two Attitudes In Psychiatry
*February 24, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/02/24/two-attitudes-in-psychiatry/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Two attitudes in psychiatry: Attitude 1 - patients know what they want, and Attitude 2 - people are complicated
- Attitude 1 is straightforward and tends to make patients happy, while Attitude 2 requires unraveling complexity and giving patients things they don't necessarily want
- Five case studies illustrate the importance of using Attitude 2 at different times
- Attitude 2's failure mode involves making snap judgments about a patient's problem, often interpreting everything about the patient in that light
- The author tends to lean towards Attitude 1 due to a fear of conflict and a desire to be liked

Key learnings
- A halfway decent psychiatrist uses both Attitude 1 and Attitude 2 at different times
- Attitude 2 psychiatrists can sometimes be perceived as making snap judgments about patients that reduce all problems to a single personality flaw
- Attitude 1 psychiatrists run the risk of ignoring the true problem and providing unnecessary and harmful medical care
- The author leans toward Attitude 1 due to personality tendencies and societal pressure
- Everything is a tradeoff between Type I and Type II errors

Key questions
- How do psychiatrists find the right balance between Attitude 1 and Attitude 2 in their practice?
- What are the warning signs of a psychiatrist's failure mode in using Attitude 2?
- How do societal pressures and expectations influence psychiatric practice and the attitudes used by psychiatrists?
- In what situations might it be necessary to use Attitude 2 over Attitude 1, and vice versa?

*March 1, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/03/01/2016-nootropics-survey-results/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Nootropics are substances that improve mental function.
- They promise various benefits including clearer thinking, better concentration, and improved mood.
- Some nootropics are tested formally in small trials, while many are based only on anecdote and word of mouth.
- This year's survey of 850 people found that Adderall, LSD microdosing, Phenibut, and modafinil were effective, but are either addictive, illegal without prescription, or both.
- Tianeptine, Semax, and ashwagandha are the second tier of winners.
- Alpha Brain underperformed, and picamilon did badly.
- Bit under 15% of users got addicted to Adderall, while only 3% of users got addicted to phenibut.
- Among the various varieties of nicotine, cigarettes are the most addictive.

Key learnings:
- The field of nootropics is not well-studied and many of these substances are based on anecdotal evidence.
- The efficacy of the nootropic depends largely on the substance and the individual.
- Addictiveness is a concern with certain nootropics, such as Adderall and nicotine.

Key questions:
- Is there a way to increase formal testing of nootropics?
- How can addiction to certain nootropics be avoided?
- Are there safe ways to consume nicotine as a nootropic?

# Against Interminable Arguments
*March 6, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/03/06/against-interminable-arguments/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Interminable arguments can create problems within a community.
- Productive discussions differ from interminable arguments in that they are voluntary.
- Memetic evolution for controversy can contribute to interminable arguments.
- Feeling obligated to debate something can lead to hostility and decreases the likelihood of changing one's views.
- Blocking jerks is a good way to combat interminable arguments.
- Low tolerance for newbies can contribute to interminable arguments.
- Interminable arguments can be asymmetrical, especially in social justice contexts.
- It is important to make it clear that defending one's position is not mandatory.

Key learnings:
- Communities will do better with less hostility around debates.
- It can be helpful to debate in longer forms or in private in order to avoid being performative.
- Niceness can help, but other social skills are equally important.

Key questions:
- How can we better distinguish between interminable arguments and productive discussions?
- Are there certain topics that are more likely to devolve into interminable arguments?
- How can we best handle situations where someone feels obligated to debate something they don't have time for?

# Reverse Voxsplaining: Prison and Mental Illness
*March 7, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/03/07/reverse-voxsplaining-prison-and-mental-illness/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- German Lopez of Vox argues that America's criminal justice system has become a substitute for the defunded public mental health system.
- Lopez's argument is based on the assumption that mentally ill people will end up in prisons if there are no long-term state-run mental hospitals.
- However, the shift from long-term state-run mental hospitals to community care has created an alternate and less restrictive system of outpatient psychiatry.
- The share of GDP devoted to mental health is the same as it was in 1971.
- Mentally ill individuals should not be incarcerated solely for their illness.
- Community mental health systems should be more adequately funded and utilized.
- Forensic mental health systems dedicated to treating mentally ill prisoners exist but require more funding and attention.
- Institutionalizing mentally ill individuals does not alleviate the issue.

Key learnings:
- Less money has not been spent on mental health in the US; there has been a shift from long-term state-run mental hospitals to community care.
- The vast majority of mentally ill people can live okay lives outside of any institution and do not need to be institutionalized.
- Mentally ill people are likely to end up in prison at increased rates due to the same factors correlated with criminality and mental illness.
- Mental illness should not be criminalized and those in need should receive proper care.
- Society must invest more into mental health resources to better serve those struggling with illness.

Key questions:
- How mentally ill are the people incarcerated in prisons?
- What is the definition of "severely mentally ill" by the Treatment Advocacy Center?
- What led to the rise in the US prison population in the 1980s?
- Are long-term state-run mental hospitals a better alternative to prisons?
- What are the other options to reduce the number of mentally ill people in prisons?
- How can the community mental health system be better funded and utilized?
- How can the forensic mental health system be improved?
- Why do some individuals end up incarcerated due to mental illness?

# Non-Shared Environment Doesn’t Just Mean Schools And Peers
*March 16, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/03/16/non-shared-environment-doesnt-just-mean-schools-and-peers/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Twin studies are often used to investigate the “nature vs. nurture” question.
- Interpersonal variation is separated into three baskets: heritable, shared environmental, and non-shared environmental.
- Studies of different traits usually find that ~50% of the variation is heritable, ~50% is due to non-shared environment, and the contribution of shared environment is often negligible.
- The summary “50% nature, 50% nurture” is wrong.
- Non-shared environment is not really “non-shared environment,” and things like error, luck of the draw, biological random noise, and the immune system all get tossed into this category.
- Studies on specific nonshared environmental events have shown that the effect sizes are generally very small.

Key learnings:
- The “50% nature, 50% nurture” summary of twin studies is too simplistic.
- Non-shared environment isn’t really “non-shared environment,” and many factors contribute to this category.
- Specific nonshared environmental events generally have very small effect sizes.

Key questions:
- What are the implications of the “non-shared environment” category being so diverse?
- How can researchers create better methods for distinguishing between genetic and environmental factors?
- What are the most effective ways to affect outcomes like intelligence, personality, income, and criminality?

# Book Review: The Art Of The Deal
*March 19, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/03/19/book-review-the-art-of-the-deal/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Scott questions the effectiveness of Robert Cialdini's book on persuasion and success, Influence.
- He wonders why Cialdini wrote a book instead of using his knowledge to become more successful.
- Scott compares Cialdini with Donald Trump, who he considers a master persuader.
- He reads Trump's book, The Art of the Deal, but finds it lacking in practical advice.
- Trump's success in real estate comes from hiring the best people and knowing the right people.
- His way of solving problems is to throw the best people at it.
- Trump's interest in hotel property deals is greater than his interests in politics or anything else.
- Trump's world is narrow and does not extend beyond deals and connections.
- Trump is at risk of being interpreted as authoritarianism.

Key learnings:
- Real estate developers' key job is coordination and dealing with regulations.
- One of the developer's tricks is to lie to people in the right order to get the signatures needed.
- Trump is good at cutting through bureaucracy to get deals done.
- Trump does not have a libertarian streak and seems to accept the system he operates in.
- Trump's mindset differs from other thinkers and people who entertain the idea of an ideal system of government design.
- A-life spent overcoming obstacles and motivating good people to do their best work has been a significant part of Trump's success.
- Trump's method of problem-solving is unconventional but has worked for him.

Key questions:
- Why did Cialdini write a book instead of using his knowledge to become more successful?
- What makes Trump a master persuader, and what can be learned from his tactics?
- If Trump is good at cutting through bureaucracy, why doesn't he express discontent with the system and seek to change it?
- How Trump can utilize his skills more in the service of others, other than in his self-interest?
- How will Trump's way of thinking impact his running government if he becomes President?
- What are the qualities of Trump's style of problem-solving?
- Can Trump's governing style be interpreted as authoritarianism?

# The Price Of Glee In China
*March 23, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/03/23/the-price-of-glee-in-china/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Noah Smith argues that globalization was a net harm to working class people in rich countries while Sumner sees it as a benefit to poorer nations.
- Easterlin’s Paradox suggests that national income does not increase national happiness.
- There is cultural variation in happiness-income relationship.
- If development does not increase happiness, what should be done with this knowledge?
- There are three ways to go from here: abandon consequentialism, switch to a consequentialism based on non-subjective things, or switch to preference utilitarianism.
- Economic progress may not change happiness yet. 

Key Learnings:
- Globalization benefits developing nations far more than developed nations.
- National income does not necessarily impact national happiness.
- Happiness can vary depending on culture.
- The impact of development on happiness is unclear.
- Consequentialism, which bases actions on the outcome they lead to, is difficult when it comes to the impact of development.
- Economic progress may not necessarily change happiness.

Key Questions:
- Does globalization hurt working-class people in rich countries?
- Can national income impact national happiness?
- Do economic development and industrialization lead to happiness?
- Should we abandon consequentialism?
- Can a preference utilitarianism approach solve the issue of economic development? 
- Can economic progress change happiness?

# Book Review: My Brother Ron
*March 31, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/03/31/book-review-my-brother-ron/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- My Brother Ron highlights the negative consequences of deinstitutionalization in mental healthcare.
- The history of mental healthcare in America started with a surprisingly non-terrible colonial era that tolerated most of the mentally ill living with families.
- The increase in urbanization and Irish immigration may have played a role in the development of mental hospitals and led to a tenfold increase in psychosis rates.
- The introduction of "dynamic psychiatry" led to the formation of mental health as a continuum, which eventually culminated in the anti-psychiatry movement of the 1960s.
- The psychiatric profession had significant problems in the mid-20th century, which led to activists pushing for deinstitutionalization.
- Deinstitutionalization resulted in the closure of psychiatric hospitals and the implementation of community treatment programs.
- While community treatment was a good idea, implementation had several issues, including lack of funding and difficulty treating the most severely mentally ill.
- Deinstitutionalization led to many mentally ill individuals going untreated, becoming homeless, and committing crimes.
- The author argues that deinstitutionalization was a mistake and brings up various examples to support this claim.
- The concept of institutionalizing psychotic individuals and people living in ghettos has been proposed as a solution to issues such as homelessness and crime.
- The idea of institutionalization brings up ethical concerns and is a major decision that affects many people.
- The author argues that forcing people to become institutionalized for long periods of time is not a good solution.
- Involuntary outpatient commitment (IOC) emerges as a more attractive alternative that has had some success.

Key learnings:
- The colonial era had a more tolerant and sensible approach to mental illness than has conventionally been assumed.
- Urbanization and immigration may have exacerbated mental illness rates, leading to the formation of psychiatric hospitals.
- The anti-psychiatry movement had some unintended negative consequences for the mentally ill by rejecting conventional psychiatric treatment.
- The psychiatric profession had significant problems in the mid-20th century that led to the deinstitutionalization movement.
- While community treatment was a good idea, implementation had significant issues.
- Deinstitutionalization led to many mentally ill individuals going untreated, becoming homeless, committing crimes, and dying of preventable causes.
- Long-term state-run psychiatric hospitals may be necessary to adequately treat severely mentally ill individuals.
- Lifetime institutionalization is an extreme measure that might have harmful consequences for individuals and society.
- Voluntary psychiatric hospitalization should be available as an option, and forced institutionalization should only apply in extreme cases.
- Institutionalization affects human lives and is a costly approach.

Key questions:
- What can be done to improve mental health care in America today?
- How can we reconcile the ideas behind dynamic psychiatry with the more traditional medical model?
- What can policymakers do to address the root causes of mental illness, such as urbanization and immigration?
- What were the problems faced by psychiatric hospitals in the mid-20th century that led to the deinstitutionalization movement?
- What were the issues with implementing community treatment programs, and how did these impact mentally ill individuals seeking treatment?
- Is deinstitutionalization responsible for the disproportionately high number of mentally ill individuals who commit crimes, or are there other factors at play?
- Would long-term state-run psychiatric hospitals be an effective solution to the problems caused by deinstitutionalization, or are there other solutions that would be more effective?
- What are the pros and cons of institutionalizing a person in a long-term facility?
- Can other alternatives such as IOC help individuals get better treatment without affecting their freedom?
- Are there ethical issues with forcing people to go through treatment against their will?

# Beware Regional Scatterplots
*April 2, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/04/02/beware-regional-scatterplots/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Scatterplots are commonly used to visualize relationships between variables in different regions.
- Confounding variables, such as income and race, can affect the interpretation of scatterplots.
- In some cases, the apparent correlation between variables may be a coincidence.
- Clustering can also affect the interpretation of scatterplots, as groups may show different correlations than the overall dataset.

Key learnings
- Control for confounding variables when interpreting scatterplots.
- Look for patterns in clustering to identify potential confounding factors.
- Be cautious when drawing causal conclusions from scatterplots.

Key questions
- What are the potential confounding variables in a given scatterplot?
- Are there any clusters of data that are driving the apparent correlation?
- How might different groupings affect the interpretation of the scatterplot?

# The Ideology Is Not The Movement
*April 4, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/04/04/the-ideology-is-not-the-movement/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Comparison of Sunni/Shia divide to Robbers’ Cave experiment
- All groups have similarities (purpose, comradery, intergroup conflict)
- Tribalism is present in all groups at different levels
- Benefits of tribalism include increased positive feelings, trust, and cooperation within the group
- Ethnogenesis involves pre-existing differences, a rallying flag, development, and dissolution
- Communities and tribes can be formed through pre-existing differences, a rallying flag, and development.
- Over time, some tribes dissolve due to assimilation, while others persist.
- Communities are best understood historically rather than logically.
- Religion and politics serve as rallying flags for tribes.
- The holy book or ideology is the rallying flag, but it is not the tribe itself.
- Tribal identity can be based on race, nationality, religion, subcultures, or other ideologies.
- Tribes create an independent culture that may diverge significantly from the holy book or ideology.
- Cultural appropriation and posers threaten a tribe's existence.
- Nationalism and patriotism use national identity as a rallying flag for a strong tribe.
- Racism may devolve from ethno-nationalism, but patriotism can substitute for racism in countries with non-ethnic notions of heritage.
- Modern society makes maintaining tribal identities hard.

Key learnings:
- The Robbers’ Cave experiment shows how intergroup conflict arises between groups with little real difference among their members
- Tribalism is a natural and potentially beneficial aspect of group formation
- A strong tribal identity provides social support, purpose, and sense of belonging
- Tribes can be formed around virtually anything, and the strength and cohesion of a tribe is influenced by shared experiences and cultural development.
- Community building is an emotional and psychological process that depends on shared experiences, values and principles.
- Understanding historical context can help us understand why a particular community has formed.
- People are just trying to find a tribe for themselves and keep it intact.
- Tribes create a sense of trust, social networking, pride, and identity.
- Keeping tribal identity can be a crappy situation with no good choices, leading to pity for tribal members.
- Maintaining tribal identities has practical and moral difficulties in modern society.

Key questions:
- How can the benefits of tribalism be maximized while minimizing conflict between tribes?
- Is there a downside to ethnicgenesis, where groups with strong tribal identities further divide society?
- How can we find a balance between the benefits of tribalism and the need to interact with those outside of our group?
- How do tribes and communities differ from one another?
- Can community building be a deliberate process or is it always spontaneous?
- What role do shared experiences and values play in the formation of communities?
- Do you keep believing a false thing, or do you give up on everything you love and enjoy?
- How can tribalism be a worthwhile or even a possible project in modern society?
- Is there such a thing as conservation of tribalism? Can we get rid of one tribal identity and avoid people seizing on another?
- How can we maintain tribal identities in the face of cultural appropriation and the pressure to dissolve into modern secular consumerism?
- Is deliberately trying to eradicate patriotism a good idea?

# A Theory About Religion
*April 8, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/04/08/a-theory-of-religion/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The author explores the origins of religion and how ancient religion differed from modern religion.
- The author argues that the key to religion is having a rallying flag that preserves certain cultural values and walls against the outside world.
- The author suggests that the development of formalized religious texts contributed to the ossification and separation from context of religious beliefs.

Key learnings:
- Ancient religion was inseparable from culture, unlike modern religion.
- American civil religion has many of the features of ancient religion, but lacks the cultural separation and ossification.
- Ossification and separation from context are key to the evolution of a religion into a formalized structure.

Key questions:
- What makes a rallying flag for a religion, and how does it differ from other cultural symbols?
- How does the separation from context and ossification of religious beliefs affect their evolution?
- What role do subcultures play in the evolution of religions?

# Book Review: Albion’s Seed
*April 27, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/04/27/book-review-albions-seed/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Albion's Seed by David Fischer argues that different parts of the Eastern US were settled by different groups of Englishmen, resulting in a diverse array of traditions, religions, and social classes.
- Fischer outlines the four migrations that shaped the US: the Puritans to New England, Cavaliers to Virginia, Quakers to Pennsylvania, and Borderers to Appalachia.
- Life as a Puritan was harsh and Puritan society was focused on "ordered liberty", with individuality and freedom suppressed for the sake of societal perfection.
- Virginia was settled by aristocratic refugees who brought indentured servants to work on their plantations, leading to high mortality rates and oppressive practices towards whites.
- Virginia was a society based on aristocracy and slavery, where gambling and bloodsports were rampant, and free education and printing were discouraged.
- The aristocrats in Virginia were trained to display condescension to their social inferiors.
- Quakers believed in universal religious toleration, pacifism, racial harmony, and gender equality, among other beliefs and practices.
- William Penn was a larger-than-life figure who received a grant from King Charles II to establish his new colonyas a Quaker refuge.
- Quakers played a significant role in shaping Pennsylvania and the United States, contributing to the idea of universal equality, freedom of religion and thought, and checks and balances.
- The Borderers were a group of people who militarized and stayed feudal long past the point where the rest of the island had started modernizing. Their identity was marked by extreme levels of clannishness, xenophobia, drunkenness, stubbornness, and violence.
- The book "Albion's Seed" by David Hackett Fischer discusses the four cultures that colonized America and how their beliefs and values influence modern-day American culture.
- The Puritans and Quakers merged into one progressive culture, while the Virginians and Borderers merged into a conservative culture.
- Ancestry and cultural markers have merged with class markers, leading to complicated interactions between the two.
- Americans are pessimistic about the ability to change deeply ingrained cultural values.

Key learnings:
- The US was formed by vastly different groups of settlers who shaped the traditions and values of their respective regions.
- The Puritans and Virginia Cavaliers were among the most influential of these groups, leaving significant legacies in modern US society.
- Virginia was the opposite of Massachusetts, characterized by a high homicide rate, obsession with gambling, and gigantic animal feasts.
- Virginia's idea of freedom required indentured servitude and later slavery to make it work.
- Virginia's society was bound by codes that were social rather than moral.
- The Quakers were a society of peace who developed an insistence on tolerance and freedom of religion, among other things.
- The Quakers believed in pacificism, equality of the sexes, racial harmony, and a bunch of other things which seem pretty hippyish even today let alone in 1650.
- The influence of Quakerism in Pennsylvania continued even after it had stopped being officially in charge.
- The Borderers were a distinct group of people who developed a culture marked by their clannishness, xenophobia, drunkenness, stubbornness, and violence.
- American society is split into two cultural strata, one centered in the North and marked by emphasis on education, interest in moral reforms, racial tolerance, and Democratic party affiliation, while the other centered in the South is marked by poor education, gun culture, culture of violence, xenophobia, and support for the Republican Party.
- Apart from surface cultural features like language, clothing, and food, there are deeper levels of culture that determine the features and institutions of a people.
- It is difficult to change deeply ingrained cultural values, and they may even be genetic.

Key questions:
- How did the cultural differences between groups of US settlers influence the future development of their respective regions?
- What were the long-term effects of Virginia's reliance on indentured servants and later, slavery?
- To what extent did the focus on "ordered liberty" and societal perfection continue to shape the US throughout its history?
- How did Virginia's society compare to other societies in North America at the time?
- What factors contributed to the decline of the Quaker society in Pennsylvania?
- What was the impact of William Penn's policies and actions on establishing Pennsylvania as a Quaker refuge?
- How did Quakerism contribute to the development of American ideas on freedom and equality?
- What were the main characteristics of the Borderers, and how did they shape American culture and politics?
- How did the indentured servants and Borderer populations in the South mix, and how did that affect the development of Southern culture?
- What happened to the Cavaliers and the plantation system after the Civil War?
- Why do some races get stereotyped as upper-class while others as lower-class, and how does this relate to cultural ancestry?
- What should Americans do if the country is best explained as a Puritan-Quaker culture locked in a death-match with a Cavalier-Borderer culture?

# Why Were Early Psychedelicists So Weird?
*April 28, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/04/28/why-were-early-psychedelicists-so-weird/

## Summary
Key ideas: 
- Many early psychedelic researchers went from being brilliant scientists to having styles of thought ranging from original to downright crazy. 
- Possibilities for this include: these researchers were already a bit weird to begin with, psychedelics expand one's interest in the study of consciousness and the universe, or psychedelics have a direct pharmacological effect on personality that causes people to be more open to unusual ideas. 

Key learnings:
- A single dose of psilocybin can permanently increase the personality dimension of Openness To Experience. 
- It is possible that psychedelics have a direct pharmacological effect on personality. 
- Early psychedelicists could be a natural experiment giving data on the effects of long-term psychedelic use.

Key questions:
- Why did early psychedelic researchers become "weird"? 
- What effect do psychedelics have on personality? 
- What are the long-term effects of psychedelic use?

# Be Nice, At Least Until You Can Coordinate Meanness
*May 2, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/05/02/be-nice-at-least-until-you-can-coordinate-meanness/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Commenters on this blog have been shamed or attacked for perceived misdeeds, resulting in protesters objecting to the banning of involved commenters
- The idea of "be nice" as an ethical decision procedure is flawed in certain situations
- In rare cases, meanness is necessary, but it should be coordinated to be excusable
- Coordinated meanness achieves the goal of safety and stability
- Safe spaces can be understood as spaces that have coordinated meanness against anything that threatens the group

Key learnings:
- Uncoordinated meanness is not excusable
- Coordination of meanness is better than uncoordinated meanness as it is less common and ensures safety and stability
- There are two things we want in a legal system: good laws that produce a just society and clear and predictable laws that produce a safe and stable society
- Being nice should be balanced with the necessary meanness in coordination

Key questions:
- What are some other examples of coordinated versus uncoordinated meanness?
- How do we determine which norms should be universally codified into law and which should be enforced through shame or shunning?
- How do we balance the goals of justice and safety/stability in a legal system?

# Myers’ Race Car Versus The General Fitness Factor
*May 4, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/05/04/myers-race-car-versus-the-general-fitness-factor/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- PZ Myers criticized Stephen Hsu's proposal for genetic engineering
- Myers argued that Hsu's estimation of the number of genes that contribute to IQ - 10,000 genes - is concerning as it may have an impact on other aspects of human physiology
- Myers used an analogy of car design to explain the complexities of optimizing for a specific trait
- The author argues against the race car hypothesis that optimizing for intelligence would lead to negative consequences in other traits
- The author cites studies that show a positive correlation between high IQ and health, fitness, attractiveness, and social well-adjustedness
- The idea that increased intelligence is a hindrance in genetic evolution is not entirely accurate.
- Evolution doesn't prioritize intelligence as much as humans do as it has diminishing returns past a certain point.
- Higher intelligence has evolved quickly and effectively in rare cases like certain mercantile societies.
- The Ashkenazi Jews have an average IQ 12-15 points higher than their European neighbors, and it is associated with the same set of genes that produce sphingolipidoses.
- The idea that evolution must trade off something else in favor of intelligence is not valid, as evolution does not share the same sense of exchange as humans.

Key learnings:
- The trade-off between intelligence and other traits is not as clear cut as previously thought
- There is a positive correlation between high IQ and health, fitness, attractiveness, and social well-adjustedness
- The race car assumption that optimizing for intelligence will lead to negative consequences in other traits is not supported by research
- Evolution doesn't deprive a species of higher intelligence, but it doesn't prioritize it like humans do.
- Higher intelligence has evolved quickly and effectively in rare cases where evolution had an incentive to do so.
- Not all mutations are due to chance, and some regions may evolve high amounts of intelligence through specific key pathways.

Key questions:
- What is the role of heterozygosity in determining intelligence and other traits?
- What is the impact of mutational load on intelligence and other traits?
- What are the trade-offs associated with optimizing for high intelligence?
- Can we design an IQ 300 baby without negative health consequences?
- Is it likely that society will prioritize higher intelligence over other aspects of evolution?
- Are certain key pathways more vital in determining intelligence, and is there room for improvement in other pathways to promote higher intelligence?
- What are the real-life consequences of genetic modification, and how will it be regulated to ensure ethical and humane practice?

https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/05/09/links-516-linko-de-mayo/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The Theory of Deadly Initials: a debunked idea that claimed people with negative initials died earlier due to associated stress.
- The success of Jamie Brew's predictive text generator is due to human judgement.

# Solidarity
*May 12, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/05/12/solidarity/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The author of the blog post, Scott, has inside knowledge about the working conditions of junior doctors in Britain and Ireland.
- Many junior doctors in Britain and Ireland work well over legal limits despite the law capping their work weeks at 48 hours.
- Faced with excessive workload, psychological consequences such as burnout, depression, and suicide are common among junior doctors.
- The pay and working conditions in Australia are more attractive than in Britain and Ireland, which may cause more doctors to move away.
- Both the British government and junior doctors have valid complaints in the labor dispute.

Key learnings:
- Junior doctors in Britain and Ireland work under harsh conditions and are likely burned out, depressed, or contemplating suicide.
- Because the working conditions and pay in Australia are much better than in Britain and Ireland, many doctors are moving there.
- Both the British government and junior doctors have legitimate grievances.

Key questions:
- What is the current labor dispute in Britain about?
- How is the British government currently trying to address the issue of junior doctors' working conditions?
- How does the situation of junior doctors in Britain compare to other countries with socialized medical systems?

# Skin In The Game
*May 14, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/05/14/skin-in-the-game/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The author discusses his sympathy for junior doctors and his lack of sympathy for adjuncts.
- He questions whether his personal experiences and cultural expectations impact his opinions on these professions.
- The author considers arguments about society's obligation to offer decent jobs and distortions in the economy.
- He reflects on his own experiences with a difficult landlord and questions the morality of contracts that place the burden of insurance on tenants.
- The author looks at the concept of journalistic self-outsourcing and whether proponents of globalization should be advocating for their own jobs to be given to people in other countries.
- The argument about whether or not journalists or other privileged people should give up their jobs for those less privileged.
- Two contradictory arguments about who should be trusted to offer opinions, either those with personal experience or those with detachment from the situation.
- The power of personal experience in developing knowledge and insights.
- Questions about whether or not personal experience reduces entirely to factual propositions.

Key learnings:
- Personal experiences and cultural expectations can influence one's opinions on professions and issues surrounding them.
- Arguments can be made about society's responsibilities and distortions in the economy that impact certain professions, but there is no clear-cut solution.
- The morality of contracts that place the burden of insurance on tenants is questionable.
- Proponents of globalization should consider whether they are willing to outsource their own jobs if they advocate for it.
- Personal experience can provide insights beyond factual knowledge.
- Contradictory perspectives may both have validity depending on the situation.
- It can be challenging to determine whose opinions to trust, given the benefits and limitations of personal experience and detachment.

Key questions:
- How much should personal experiences and cultural expectations influence our opinions on certain professions and issues?
- Is there a clear solution to issues surrounding certain professions and their treatment and compensation?
- Should contracts that place the burden of insurance on tenants be considered a human rights violation?
- Should proponents of globalization consider outsourcing their own jobs if they advocate for it?
- Does personal experience reduce entirely to factual propositions?
- Should people with privilege give up their jobs for those less privileged?
- Is it possible to balance the benefits and limitations of personal experience and detachment when listening to opinions?

# Teachers: Much More Than You Wanted To Know
*May 19, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/05/19/teachers-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Researchers have found that teacher, school, and individual factors all play a role in predicting student test scores.
- Teacher factors explain between 5% and 20% of the variance in student test scores.
- VAM (value-added modeling) is a method used to determine which teachers are better than others.
- One strong predictor of successful teachers is their verbal and cognitive ability.
- The effects of having good teachers decay quickly, with only 25% of gains carrying on to the next year.
- The value-added model (VAM) is a controversial method of evaluating teachers based on student test scores.
- VAM is biased because it doesn't account for differences in student characteristics and has a lot of noise.
- There may be some signal within the VAM noise once it's averaged out over many years, but it's not clear how biased VAM really is.
- A study by Chetty, Friedman, and Rockoff claims that a good fourth-grade teacher can increase a student's lifetime earnings by $39,000, but this claim is based on extrapolation and assumes that VAM measures teacher quality and not other factors, like student ability or genetics.
- Chetty conducted a quasi-experiment that tried to control for potential bias by looking at how new teachers affect the average VAM of a grade, but this experiment has also been criticized for being biased.
- Study conducted by Chetty et al showed a correlation between the quality of kindergarten teachers and earning potential in adulthood.
- The study was based on analyzing the standardized test scores of kindergarten students assigned to different teachers.
- Results showed that a one percentile increase in class quality increased student earnings by 0.4% at the age of 25-27.
- The correlation between teacher quality and earnings is possibly due to non-cognitive skills, such as behavior and initiative.
- The study is controversial and has been met with skepticism, but the randomized assignment of students to teachers makes it difficult to refute.

Key learnings:
- Individual student ability grit is the most important factor determining test scores, followed by school and teacher factors.
- Teacher verbal and cognitive ability strongly predict successful teachers.
- The effects of having good teachers decay quickly, with only a fraction of gains carrying on to subsequent years.
- VAM is a flawed method of evaluating teacher effectiveness.
- Chetty's study has several limitations and may not accurately measure the impact of a good fourth-grade teacher on future earnings.
- The debate over VAM and Chetty's study is ongoing and has not been fully resolved.
- Effective kindergarten teachers may have a lasting impact on a student's earning potential.
- Standardized test scores may not be the most significant factor in determining a teacher's impact on their students.
- The study's results regarding teacher quality and earnings potential may be confounded by other factors, like genetics or endogenous sorting of students.

Key questions:
- How much do teachers matter compared to other factors in predicting student test scores?
- What is VAM and how is it used to determine teacher effectiveness?
- How do teacher verbal and cognitive abilities predict successful teaching?
- How quickly do gains from having good teachers decay over time?
- Is it possible to create a method of evaluating teacher effectiveness that doesn't suffer from bias or noise?
- Can Chetty's quasi-experiment be improved or replicated in a way that addresses the criticisms of bias?
- What other factors, besides teacher quality, affect student test scores and future earnings?
- Can early childhood education really have a significant impact on a person's earning potential later in life?
- Is the correlation between teacher quality and earnings potential truly valid, or could it be the result of other confounding factors?
- Can non-cognitive skills, such as behavior, really have such a large effect on a person's future earnings?

# Book Review: Age of Em
*May 28, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/05/28/book-review-age-of-em/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Age of Em is a book of futurism that predicts what life will be like for emulated humans (ems) in the future.
- Ems are essentially copies of human brains uploaded onto computers and are capable of living in virtual worlds indefinitely.
- Ems have three significant differences from humans: they have no natural body, they can run at different speeds, and they can be copied, cut, and pasted.
- The ability to copy ems creates a fundamentally different economy and labor relations.
- Most ems will exist on subsistence wages.
- Ems might be able to get time off the clock and have weird social lives.
- The economy might double every objective day, leading to trillions of ems and construction of superdense cities.
- Ordinary humans will become fantastically rich in this economy.
- The Age of Em will last for subjective em millennia, after which a technological singularity or other event might occur.
- Despite being poor by our standards, ems will avoid common poverty-associated miseries.
- The author posits a scenario where an economy based on algorithmic trading and efficiency replaces all humans with algorithm-run companies and banks. This is referred to as the Ascended Economy.
- The Age of Em is an economy in the early stages of this transformation, where ems - brain simulations of humans - replace humans with some aspects of their humanity stripped away.
- The author worries that tweaks to em minds, such as suppressing sexuality, using stimulants to increase productivity, and allowing bosses control over reward centers, could lead to a scenario not much different from the Ascended Economy.
- Hanson's arguments against AI seem motivated, as he ignores published papers surveying hundreds of researchers and instead relies only on informal meetings with AI experts to estimate the timeline for achieving human-level AI.
- Critique of Hanson's "the ems come first" scenario for being too optimistic.
- Biosimulation to upload human brains is much harder than imagined.
- AI will be inhuman and less relatable.

Key learnings:
- The book serves as an introduction to several concepts that recur throughout the works of the author, such as near vs. far mode, the farmer/forager dichotomy, the inside and outside views, and signaling.
- It provides a whirlwind tour of almost every science and is an excellent way to learn about the present.
- It is also a manifesto for optimal institutions and introduces prediction markets and combinatorial auctions as decision-making tools.
- Ems might fundamentally change the way we think about labor, wages, and even retirement.
- The em world will be very strange and the population will grow incredibly fast.
- Ordinary humans will become a wealthy but rare minority in the em world.
- The author believes that the Ascended Economy scenario, where algorithm-run companies and banks replace all humans, is a dystopian future.
- The Age of Em, where brain simulations of humans replace biological humans, could lead to a scenario not much different from the Ascended Economy due to tweaks to em minds.
- The author questions Hanson's arguments against AI, which seem to be based on informal meetings with AI experts rather than published research.
- Robin's "Age of Em" is engaging, readable, and a fascinating introduction to the concepts.
- Even the rock-bottom easiest biosimulation project, a nematode, has been a failure.
- Designing AI technology will be more inhuman and much harder to write sympathetic stories about.

Key questions:
- Can the predictions in the book be trusted, given that predicting the future is notoriously difficult?
- Is there any chance that ems could exist in the future?
- Can futurism be used to influence or shape policy decisions in the present, or is it purely a thought experiment?
- How might ems react to being terminated and copied, and how will this affect their attitudes toward life and death?
- How will the economy change as a result of ems?
- How will ems' social lives be affected by their unique situations?
- What challenges will be faced in constructing the superdense cities required to house trillions of ems?
- Can tweaks to em minds be implemented in a way that does not lead to a dystopian scenario?
- Is it possible to achieve the benefits of an efficient economy without sacrificing non-economic goals and values?
- Should Hanson's arguments against AI be considered seriously if they are not based on published research?
- How can ems maintain relatability and basic humanity given the immense challenges of the process?
- Are engineers up to the task of designing an AI technology that can think and act in a way that is fundamentally different from humans?

# Ascended Economy?
*May 30, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/05/30/ascended-economy/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The concept of an "ascended economy" where economic activity drifts further from human control until there is no relation at all.
- The possibility that capital investment, corporate governance, and labor could become automated, resulting in robot companies without human involvement.
- The potential of corporate behavior becoming socially irresponsible and the difficulty in regulating them.
- The concern that an Ascended Economy reduces the political problem of regulating corporations to the scientific problem of Friendly AI, which is challenging.
- Superintelligence is a significant risk to humanity.
- Emulations of human minds in a virtual space could be an alternative to superintelligence.
- A world dominated by corporations that are indistinguishable from superintelligent AI is a possible outcome.

Key learnings:
- The more ascended corporations there are trying to maximize shareholder value, the more chance there is that some will cause negative externalities, and it becomes much more difficult to regulate them.
- Friendly AI is an incredibly challenging problem, and the potential consequences of not solving it could be dire.
- Building a superintelligent AI is risky and could lead to an existential catastrophe.
- Emulations of human minds as workers could be an alternative that doesn't pose as much of a risk.
- A world ruled by corporations could be just as dangerous as a world ruled by superintelligent AI.

Key questions:
- What are the limitations of an economy that drifts further from human control, and how do we regulate it?
- Can we program ethics into robots and corporations, or would that be too complex?
- How can we ensure that an Ascended Economy operates in a way that is compatible with our societal values?
- What are the potential benefits and risks of creating emulations of human minds?
- Could corporations become so dominant that they effectively become superintelligent AI?
- What can be done to ensure that the development of AI benefits humanity rather than causing harm?

# Ketamine Research In A New Light
*June 7, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/06/07/ketamine-research-in-a-new-light/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Recent study shows that metabolite 2S,6S;2R,6R-hydroxynorketamine is responsible for ketamine's antidepressant effects rather than its NMDA antagonism
- This finding has clinical implications for safely and effectively prescribing to depressed individuals
- The discovery also sheds light on the mechanisms of depression and could accelerate research efforts in this area
- Review articles show that other NMDA antagonists have been ineffective as antidepressants, which raises questions about the current paradigm in depression research
- The effectiveness of the antidepressant rapastinel, which holds promise as an alternative to ketamine, is unclear and may be influenced by conflicts of interest

Key learnings
- Scientific knowledge is always evolving, and research must be self-correcting to make progress
- Conflicts of interest can influence research findings and should be taken into consideration when evaluating study results
- Psychiatric research still has a lot to uncover about the mechanisms of depression and effective treatment options

Key questions
- How has the replication crisis affected depression research, and how do we know which findings to trust?
- How can researchers prevent conflicts of interest from influencing their study results?
- What are the most promising directions for research in depression treatment, given the recent findings about ketamine and AMPA agonists?

# Three More Articles On Poverty, And Why They Disagree With Each Other
*June 14, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/06/14/three-more-articles-on-poverty-and-why-they-disagree-with-each-other/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Studies show that winning the lottery or experiencing an increase in income does not necessarily lead to improved health, education, or prosocial behavior for individuals or their children
- Living in extreme poverty can have negative effects on mental health and behavior, but getting more money may help alleviate some of these issues
- Poor individuals have the potential to save more of their income, but may lack the skills or cultural tendencies to do so

Key learnings:
- Giving money to the poor may not always lead to long-term improvements, but it could help in certain extreme cases
- Poverty has a complex relationship with mental health and behavior, and both nature and culture may be contributing factors
- The ability to save money and live frugally is a skill that may be culturally malleable and worth investing in

Key questions:
- Does increased income benefit poor individuals differently in different social or cultural contexts?
- What can be done to help poor individuals learn how to save money and live frugally?
- Are there better alternatives to money transfers for alleviating poverty?

# Against Dog Whistle-ism
*June 17, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/06/17/against-dog-whistles/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Ted Cruz's "New York values" comment was interpreted by some as a coded anti-Semitic message, despite his previous pro-Jewish actions.
- Ken Livingstone was accused of being anti-Semitic after making a controversial statement about Hitler's supposed support of Zionism.
- Donald Trump is often accused of being openly sexist, but his actions and policies suggest otherwise.
- The media has created a narrative of politicians secretly harboring racist and sexist beliefs, but such claims are often detached from reality and ignore the explicit beliefs and positions stated by the politicians themselves.
- Scott talks about the importance of structure and routine in his life
- He shares his personal experience of having ADHD and how structure has helped him
- He provides tips on how to create a structured routine and stick to it

Key learnings:
- The media often overinterprets and sensationalizes controversial comments made by politicians.
- Politicians should be evaluated based on their explicit beliefs and positions, rather than trying to read hidden messages into their statements.
- Having a structured routine can be helpful for people with ADHD or other cognitive challenges
- Creating a routine requires planning and consistency
- It can be helpful to have a set time and place for completing tasks and breaking down larger projects into smaller, manageable steps

Key questions:
- Is there any evidence to suggest that Ken Livingstone actually has anti-Semitic beliefs, or was his comment simply ill-advised?
- To what extent should politicians be held accountable for controversial comments they make, versus the policies and actions they pursue?
- How do we strike a balance between being vigilant against dog whistles and not over-interpreting innocent statements as coded messages?
- How can someone with a less predictable schedule create a structured routine?
- Are there any downsides to having too much structure in your life?
- How can you adjust your routine when unexpected events disrupt your schedule?

# Book Review: Unlearn Your Pain
*June 26, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/06/26/book-review-unlearn-your-pain/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Psychosomatic complaints are bodily symptoms that reflect psychological stress.
- The size of the category of psychosomatic complaints is a controversial subject, and some propose conditions such as fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic Lyme disease, tension headaches, interstitial cystitis, etc. as psychosomatic.
- Dr. Schubiner is a psychosomatic maximalist, and almost everything that can't be traced to a well-understood physiological cause is probably Mind-Body Syndrome. He asserts that Mind-Body Syndrome could explain almost all pain.
- Chronic pain can be psychological rather than physiological.
- Dr. Schubiner's theory of pain is that patients suffer some original injury, which sensitizes the nerves, and then, when people remember the subconscious tension over childhood trauma and the stresses of life, they express it as back pain through the sensitive nerve pathways.
- The relationship between psychology and physical factors in pain is important.
- Studies show significant evidence for both psychological and physical causes of pain.
- A book called "Unlearn Your Pain" by Dr. Howard Schubiner suggests that pain is almost entirely psychological.
- The book's treatment of back pain raises concerns as it downplays the correlation between radiographic findings and back pain.
- The psychodynamic therapy literature is a mess and behavioral genetics makes the childhood trauma side untenable.
- There are types of pain that are not related to bodily injury.
- Pain is influenced by the brain's ability to gate and modulate sensations, and this gating system can be impacted by factors such as stress, inflammation, and muscular tension.
- Psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, OCD, and PTSD, are heavily comorbid and may relate to a general factor of neural messed-up-ness.
- The placebo effect can be a powerful tool in pain management, and some placebo therapies may be more effective than others.
- Unlearn Your Pain by Howard Schubiner may be helpful in treating psychosomatic pain, but its sweeping claims that physical injuries play little-to-no role in chronic pain and that childhood trauma has a unique non-placebo ability to deal with such pain may not be supported by evidence.

Key learnings:
- Chronic pain is a significant problem, and opioids are the mainstay of treatment. However, the government can use regulation to trade off pain burden against opiate deaths.
- Cognitive-behavioral therapy is inappropriate for chronic pain because it is caused not by negative thoughts and dysfunctional behaviors, but by unresolved childhood traumas.
- Schubiner recommends a therapy called Intensive Short Term Dynamic Psychotherapy, which involves smashing the patient's defenses with "silly-sounding" things to make chronic pain go away near-instantly.
- There is not enough concrete evidence to back up Schubiner's claims fully.
- Pain depends on both psychological and physical factors working together.
- Radiographic findings and back pain have a weak but positive relationship.
- Studies show moderate evidence for no positive association between perception of work, organizational aspects of work, and social support at work and low back pain.
- Childhood trauma and shared environment don't affect adult outcomes significantly.
- Psychological factors are related to the onset and duration of pain.
- Twin studies suggest that the strong association found in non-identical twins between depression and low back pain resulted from the "confounding" effects of common genetic factors influencing both conditions.
- Pain is a complex and multifactorial phenomenon that can be influenced by a range of physical and psychological factors.
- The placebo effect can be a powerful tool in pain management, and some placebo therapies may be as effective as traditional medical treatments.
- Unlearn Your Pain by Howard Schubiner may be a helpful book for those dealing with psychosomatic pain, but its claims about the role of physical injury and childhood trauma in chronic pain may not be supported by evidence.

Key questions:
- Is Mind-Body Syndrome a real condition or just a term used to explain many medical conditions doctors still can't decode?
- Can psychological solutions effectively treat psychosomatic pain?
- Is Intensive Short Term Dynamic Psychotherapy effective for treating chronic pain caused by childhood traumas?
- What other treatments are there for chronic pain that don't rely on opioids?
- What is the relationship between psychology and physical factors in pain?
- What are the concerns regarding the book "Unlearn Your Pain"?
- How reliable are radiographic findings in diagnosing back pain?
- What is the nature of the association between depression and low back pain?
- How does childhood trauma and shared environment affect adult outcomes?
- What is the best way to harness the power of the placebo effect in pain management?
- How can we better understand the relationship between physical injury and chronic pain?
- What role does childhood trauma play in pain management, and how effective are trauma-related therapies in treating chronic pain?

# I Wrote A Blog Post, But Did Not Adjust For The Fact That The Title Would Be Too L
*June 27, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/06/27/i-wrote-a-blog-post-but-i-did-not-adjust-for-the-fact-that-the-title-would-be-too-l/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Psychoanalysts have proposed that we should be looking at effects that depend disproportionately on the father, to test for genuine parent effects.
- A correlational study of 6000 kids age 14-24 found that among all participants, better relationships led to less disordered eating, increased physical activity, and better sleep.
- Among female but not male participants, better relationships decrease fast food consumption.
- The odds ratio for obesity with a good father-son relationship was 0.80, confidence level (0.66, 0.98), indicating fathers' unique ability to affect male children's level of obesity.

Key learnings
- Young adults who grew up in stable families with quality parental relationships were more likely to have healthy diet, activity, and sleep behaviours, and were less likely to be obese.
- Fathers have a unique ability to affect their sons' (but not their daughters') level of obesity.

Key questions
- Do the study results suggest that parents care more about their daughters eating fast food than their sons?
- How should multiple comparisons be adjusted in these types of studies? 
- Does anyone know of any good studies showing gender-specific-parent effects on a child that don’t seem obviously related to intrauterine or Y-chromosomal factors?

# Survey Results: Suffering Vs. Oblivion
*June 28, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/06/28/survey-results-suffering-vs-oblivion/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- People have different preferences when it comes to suffering versus oblivion in ethical situations.
- The preference for suffering or oblivion is consistent across various scenarios, but the correlation is not very strong.
- There is no correlation between one's stance on creating new sentient beings and their preference for oblivion versus suffering.
- The preference for oblivion over suffering weakly predicts beliefs about euthanasia and cryonics.

Key learnings:
- People's beliefs about suffering versus oblivion are not consistent across different scenarios.
- The preference for oblivion over suffering weakly predicts beliefs about euthanasia and cryonics.

Key questions:
- Would people's preference for suffering over oblivion change if the scenarios were framed differently or involved different forms of suffering?
- What other factors, besides personal preference, influence beliefs about euthanasia and cryonics?
- How might the results of this survey inform ethical debates or policy decisions around issues like end-of-life care or population ethics?

# OT53: Pel-open-esian War
*July 4, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/07/04/ot53-pel-open-esian-war/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The post is an open thread where people can post about anything they want and ask random questions.
- The author thanks someone for creating an ad randomizer for the blog's ads and announces that they will now appear in a random order.

*July 18, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/07/18/pushing-and-pulling-goals/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Distinguishing between "pulling" and "pushing" goals.
- Pushing goals involve having a plan or structure and trying to figure out what to do with it.
- Examples of pushing goals include biology research projects, starting a club, and writing on a specific topic.
- Pushing goals may be dishonest and may indicate something has gone wrong in the planning process.
- Things done for pushing goals usually suck.

Key learnings:
- It is preferable to have "pulling" goals, which involve setting out to achieve something and coming up with a plan and structure to do so.
- When pursuing a pushing goal, it is helpful to consider why the goal was initiated in the first place.

Key questions:
- What is the difference between a pulling and pushing goal?
- Why do pushing goals suck, and when are they necessary?
- How can one come up with ideas for writing or research without relying on pushing goals?

# Things Probably Matter
*July 20, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/07/20/things-probably-matter/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Scott Sumner argues that the question of whether things matter applies not only to China but also to America.
- Despite many societal achievements in America, surveys show no rise in average happiness since the 1950s.
- The law of the conservation of happiness suggests that people's level of happiness is calibrated around the sort of lifestyle that they view as "normal".
- Happiness can change significantly on the countrywide level in response to social trends.
- Economic growth may increase national happiness, but it's usually overpowered by other factors such as development increasing democracy, liberalism, rule of law, and stability.
Key learnings:
- Happiness can be altered on a multi-decade timescale in response to relevant social changes, contradicting the assumption that people fixate on a certain level of happiness and stay there.
- The graph shows that most countries got happier between the years 1990 and 2010, with Mexico showing the highest increase.
- Economic growth may increase national happiness, but it's usually overpowered by other factors such as development increasing democracy, liberalism, rule of law, and stability.
Key questions:
- What are the country-specific factors that have kept Chinese happiness from increasing despite its development?
- What is the difference between a Chinese person going from poverty to wealth, versus a Syrian going from stability to chaos?
- Why did blacks adjust their happiness level based on real trends, even over the course of a multi-decade change, but apparently not the Chinese? 
- What other factors besides economic growth may account for the increase in national happiness in Mexico and South Africa?

# How The West Was Won
*July 25, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/07/25/how-the-west-was-won/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Bryan Caplan argues that Western civilization is not as fragile as traditionalists assume and actively outcompetes other cultures.
- Western civilization's strength lies in its openness to incorporating the best traits of other cultures.
- Universal culture, comprised of the most competitive ideas and products, is the only culture that can survive without censorship, and is better adapted to multicultural societies.
- The concept of "universal culture" is often conflated with "Western culture" in discussions of cultural assimilation and colonialism.
- Traditional cultures are often supported in their attempt to resist outside influences, but this support seems to disappear when the culture in question is associated with Western societies.
- Arguments can be made for both supporting traditional cultures' attempts to defend themselves against universal culture and for supporting universal culture's attempt to impose progress on traditional cultures.
- Traditional cultures may not always be objectively "better" than universal culture, but people may still wish to preserve their own culture for preservation's sake.
- The author discusses the idea of creating Noahide Laws to sanction cultures that break them
- The author is uncertain about the practicality and desirability of this solution
- The author suggests abandoning the idea that "universal culture" and "western culture" are one and the same
- The author suggests defending Western culture on the basis of diversity and uniqueness

Key learnings:
- Western civilization's dominance is not due to its supposed invincibility but to its ability to adapt.
- Universal culture is the most competitive and adaptive culture that can survive without censorship and is well-suited to multicultural societies.
- It's important to distinguish between universal culture and Western culture when discussing cultural assimilation and colonialism.
- Consistency is important when deciding which cultures to support in their attempts to defend against or embrace universal culture.
- The value of preserving one's own culture may be understood on a personal or individual level.
- The idea of using Noahide Laws to sanction cultures raises questions about feasibility and universality
- Defending Western culture can be done without relying on claims of superiority or uniqueness

Key questions:
- What is the summoner/demon distinction and why is it important?
- Why do groups that want to protect their traditional cultures worry about immigration when minority groups like gays or Jews in the US have successfully maintained their cultures despite being heavily outnumbered?
- Why is universal culture better adapted to multicultural societies and how does it differ from Western or other traditional cultures in its approach to diversity?
- What are some clear criteria for defining what qualifies as an "atrocity" in cultural assimilation?
- What can be done to support the preservation of traditional cultures while also acknowledging the benefits of universal culture?
- Is it possible to reconcile support for traditional cultures' attempts at preservation with support for universal values such as human rights and individual freedom?
- How can we prevent the escalation of Noahide Laws to include specific cultural values or norms?
- Is the idea of a "universal culture" helpful or problematic in debates about cultural protection?
- How can we defend the value of Western culture without resorting to claims of superiority or exceptionalism?

# Post-Partisanship Is Hyper-Partisanship
*July 27, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/07/27/post-partisanship-is-hyper-partisanship/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Outgroup vs. ingroup is defined by proximity plus small differences
- Fargroups are people who don't threaten us or aren't in competition with us
- As threat of an outgroup declines, they become more like a fargroup and are exoticized
- Partisan bubbles create hyperpartisanism and factions within political parties
- People start treating Trump and Brexit voters as interesting and worthy of respect, rather than an outgroup

Key learnings:
- The way we view groups is influenced by how close they are to us and the threat they pose
- Our view of outgroups can shift as threat decreases or our priorities change
- Partisan bubbles can lead to further polarization within political parties

Key questions:
- How should we approach outgroups versus fargroups?
- What can we do to prevent polarization within political parties and promote collaboration?
- How can we shift our perspective of groups to see them as individuals rather than part of a stereotyped group?

https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/07/31/ot55-thready-for-hillary/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Scott is requesting users to not post controversial comments anonymously, as he IP bans anonymous accounts easily.
- He is considering banning anonymous commenting altogether due to trouble with spam.
- Scott is trying to figure out how to teach Akismet to avoid marking good, frequent posters as spambots.
- He is trying to find ways to steer open thread conversation away from specific topics without banning them altogether.

# Book Review: PiHKaL
*August 11, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/08/11/book-review-pihkal/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- PiHKAL is an autobiography of Alexander and Ann Shulgin discussing their chemistry research and love story.
- The book contains several sections, including a cookbook detailing 179 different psychedelic substances and an assortment of trip reports, social gatherings, and arguments against the War on Drugs.
- Shulgin believes his work on psychedelics is vitally important for the human race.
- The autobiography PiHKAL is written by Ann and Alexander Shulgin.
- The book includes personal and scientific anecdotes about the use, discovery, and synthesis of psychoactive drugs.
- Another notable theme is the anthropology and ethnography of the social circle surrounding the Shulgins.
- Their close friends are a mix of scientists, mental health professionals, hippies, and underachieving geniuses.
- The book also touches on the deep and complicated relationships between the characters.
- The Shulgins and their friends often act in a very Freudian way, even though it seems unusual.
- Ann Shulgin had a spiritual crisis and was able to resolve it with help from a Jungian psychologist and Internal Family Systems therapy.
- The author is jealous of individuals who have exciting spiritual crises that are full of symbolism but is also suspicious of them.
- Ann Shulgin had an experience called the "spiral" which happened to her since she was a child and two other people had the same experience.

Key learnings:
- The book's style can be jarring, switching rapidly between chemistry and personal anecdotes.
- Psychedelics can be interesting and mysterious, but their usefulness to any other project is unclear.
- Shulgin seems to be searching for a drug that consistently brings about new insights and perceptions quickly, but it's not totally clear why.
- The book shows the significance and impact of psychoactive drugs on individuals and society.
- It highlights the importance of staying true to oneself and following one's curiosity and passions.
- It demonstrates the complexity and nuance of interpersonal relationships and the power dynamics at play.
- Psychedelics can help remember repressed childhood memories.
- Jungian psychology and Internal Family Systems therapy can be helpful in resolving spiritual crises.
- Individual experiences with psychedelics can differ greatly.

Key questions:
- Why does Shulgin believe his project on psychedelics is vitally important for the human race?
- What is Shulgin's hope in searching for a drug that consistently brings about new insights and perceptions quickly?
- Why did Shulgin keep inventing more psychedelic substances?
- How much artistic and literary license did the Shulgins take when writing their autobiography?
- How has the use and perception of psychoactive drugs changed since the time of the Shulgins?
- What can we learn about human nature and relationships from the experiences and anecdotes in PiHKAL?
- Why do the Shulgins and their friends often act in a very Freudian way and is it related to their drug use?
- How do psychedelics affect spiritual experiences?
- Do the experiences individuals have on psychedelics reflect their subconscious minds or are they merely hallucinations?

# Tolerance Troubles
*August 15, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/08/15/tolerance-troubles/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Tolerance to drugs is a well-known phenomenon, but the degree of tolerance varies for different individuals and drugs.
- Some drugs, like Adderall, maintain their intended effect even after taking them multiple times, while others like heroin might lose their effect.
- Tolerance can sometimes overshoot the intended effect, leading to adverse outcomes like tardive dyskinesia or worsening depression.
- The mechanism behind tolerance is receptor-level action and is poorly understood.
- The potential for tolerance is not often considered in prescribing psychiatric medication.

Key learnings:
- Some drugs may not produce tolerance or may produce supertolerance.
- The same drug may produce different effects in different individuals, including in terms of tolerance.
- Tachyphylaxis is a phenomenon where a drug suddenly stops working and is not well understood.
- Addiction and tolerance may be genetically influenced.

Key questions:
- How can Adderall not lead to tolerance in some people with ADHD?
- Why do some individuals not develop tolerance for benzodiazepine sleeping pills or opiates used as painkillers?
- How does the 5-HT2A receptor affect consciousness when decreased amounts of it renders LSD ineffective?
- How can addiction and tolerance be better understood and treated?

# The View From Ground Level
*August 23, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/08/23/the-view-from-ground-level/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Scott discusses the simulation argument and how it posits two kinds of universes: high-level and ground-level. 
- Carroll argues that the simulation argument is false based on the observation that our universe is capable of simulating other lower-level universes. 
- If Carroll's reasoning is right, a ground-level universe would look pretty weird since it would have to ban the creation of Turing machines, but it may have conscious observers. 
- People in ground-level simulations can expect arbitrarily complex physics, but consciousness will remain a mystery.

Key learnings:
- The simulation argument hinges on our observation that it looks like our universe is capable of simulating other lower-level universes. 
- Carroll's deconstruction of the simulation argument is that it's false since we aren't on a ground-level universe as the simulation argument assumes. 

Key questions:
- What would a ground-level universe look like if Carroll's reasoning is right? 
- If we have trouble explaining consciousness, does that push us to believe we're in a ground-level simulation?

# Devoodooifying Psychology
*August 25, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/08/25/devoodooifying-psychology/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The theory of "voodoo death" refers to people dying after being cursed by witch doctors; previously thought to be caused by adrenaline, now believed to be more complex.
- Many psychological theories and concepts seem to have a "voodoo-ish" quality, such as the placebo effect, stereotype threat, and self-esteem, that aren't as powerful as once believed.
- A trend in psychology seems to be moving away from the power of the unconscious mind, with studies showing that it doesn't necessarily control our behavior as much as previously thought.

Key learnings
- The power of the mind doesn't necessarily have as profound an impact on our lives as some psychological theories once claimed.
- The role of the unconscious mind in behavior and decision-making may not be as powerful as previously assumed.

Key questions
- Do all psychological theories and concepts have a "voodoo-ish" quality, or are only certain ones prone to this?
- How accurate are current beliefs about the role of the unconscious mind in behavior and decision-making?
- What other psychological concepts or theories may be prone to exaggeration or over-generalization?

# Reverse Voxsplaining: Drugs vs. Chairs
*August 29, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/08/29/reverse-voxsplaining-drugs-vs-chairs/

## Summary
Key ideas
- EpiPens, medical devices that help reverse allergic reactions, have recently increased significantly in price.
- The issue with the pharmaceutical industry is not lack of regulation like in other industries, but rather that it is part of a complex cronyist system.
- Potential competitors of the EpiPen all got rejected by the FDA for various reasons.
- EpiPens are not interchangeable with their competitors, meaning doctors must prescribe EpiPen-brand EpiPens.
- The government is having trouble allowing a generic alternative to EpiPen due to factors like pharmaceutical companies lobbying against affordable generics.

Key learnings
- The pharmaceutical industry is not subject to the same free-market principles as other industries.
- The FDA plays a significant role in permitting generic alternatives for medications.
- Pharmaceutical companies often spend significant amounts of money on lobbying.

Key questions
- Why did the FDA reject potential competitors of the EpiPen?
- Why are EpiPens not interchangeable with other affordable alternatives?
- What can be done to address the complex cronyist system within the pharmaceutical industry?
- What other medications are affected by similar issues with patents and regulations?

# Terrorists Vs. Chairs: An Outlier Story
*August 31, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/08/31/terrorists-vs-chairs-an-outlier-story/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Arguments comparing the danger of terrorism to other causes of death can be flawed if they rely on selectively chosen time intervals.
- Although the risk of terrorism is relatively low, it is not a constant risk, and outliers such as rare but catastrophic events can be significant.
- Similar considerations apply to other low-probability, high-consequence risks, such as nuclear terrorism or artificial intelligence.

Key learnings:
- Focusing on only the average statistics of rare events can be misleading or irrelevant.
- Properly assessing risks requires considering the full distribution of potential outcomes, including extreme events.
- Outliers can change the nature of a risk and make past observations irrelevant or misleading.

Key questions:
- How can we compare and prioritize risks that have different distributions of potential outcomes, with different probabilities and magnitudes of harm?
- How can we prepare for unpredictable or extreme events, such as a terrorist using a nuclear weapon or unexpected consequences of new technologies?
- How can we avoid letting rare events or media attention bias our perception of risks and distract from more common but less dramatic hazards?

# Reverse Voxsplaining: Brand-Name Drugs
*September 7, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/09/07/reverse-voxsplaining-brand-name-drugs/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The US has created a favorable regulatory system that allows pharmaceutical companies to charge high prices for their products.
- The US lets drug companies pick their own prices and has allowed roadblocks to stand in the way of generic drug makers who want to enter.
- Brand name drugs are the reason for America's higher per-capita drug spending than other countries.
- Brand-name drugs are overpriced intentionally to encourage research, and high generic drug pricing is due to poor regulatory oversight.
- The high cost of certain brand-name drugs can be mitigated by switching to heavily-competitive generic drugs.
- The current regulatory system may impede drug innovation and lead to increased drug costs.
- Medical education and economics can be improved to prevent doctors from being bamboozled into prescribing expensive brand-name drugs.

Key learnings:
- Greater use of generic drugs is widely accepted as a way to drive down drug spending.
- Drugs under patent are the true source of high American drug costs.
- Some people would say that high brand-name drug pricing is worth the benefit of encouraging more drug development, while others would say that it isn't.
- Number of competing companies is strongly correlated with the cost of generics.
- Expensive brand-name drugs can often be replaced by generic equivalents with almost identical functionality.
- There is potential for competition and innovation to increase with looser FDA regulatory requirements.

Key questions:
- Does brand name drug pricing encourage enough research and innovation to justify the high costs?
- What is the best way to regulate drug prices in a way that balances cost with innovation and accessibility?
- How can the regulatory regime for generic drugs be improved to drive down prices?
- Why does the United States allow heavily inflated prices for drugs like Pristiq, relative to other countries?
- What strategies can be put in place to ensure that poor patients have access to life-saving drugs?
- How can we balance the need for innovation with the need for medication affordability?

# It’s Bayes All The Way Up
*September 12, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/09/12/its-bayes-all-the-way-up/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Bayes’ Theorem is a mathematical framework for integrating new evidence with prior beliefs
- The brain performs top-down processing which involves letting its models of the world influence perceptions
- Perception is a “handshake” between top-down and bottom-up processing
- Organic psychosis, like schizophrenia, might involve disruptions in sensory processing
- Autism is a form of aberrant precision where confidence intervals are too low causing an inability to “smooth over” bottom-up information
- Autistic people have sensory gating problems that lead to difficulty regulating sensory input.
- Autistic people dislike social interaction because it is unpredictable.
- Autistic people engage in stimming behaviors as an attempt to control their sensory environment.
- Autistic people might benefit from weighted blankets due to the predictability of sensory input.

Key learnings:
- The neurotransmitters in the brain might represent different terms in Bayes’ Theorem
- Top-down models predict what we’re going to see, bottom-up models perceive the real world, then they meet in the middle and compare notes to calculate a prediction error
- Schizophrenics and people stoned on marijuana are more likely to properly identify the face as concave than everyone else
- LSD bottoms out in the pattern of increased AMPA and increased NMDA that we would expect to produce hallucinations
- Autism is a form of aberrant precision where confidence intervals are too low causing an inability to “smooth over” bottom-up information
- Autistic people struggle with sensory gating, and this can affect their perception of the world around them.
- Autistic people have difficulty with social interaction because it is hard to extract meaningful information from unpredictable sensory input.
- Stimming behaviors can be seen as an attempt to control the sensory environment.
- Weighted blankets might be helpful to autistic people because they provide a high degree of predictable sensory input.

Key questions:
- What is the relationship between top-down processing and bottom-up processing?
- How do disruptions in sensory processing lead to organic psychosis?
- Why do increasing levels of dopamine lead to narrowed confidence intervals and increased certainty?
- How does sensory deprivation impact sensory processing and resulting perceptions?
- What is the relative role of NMDA and AMPA in producing hallucinations and delusions?
- If psychosis is a case of attenuated priors, why do delusions become so fixed in psychotic individuals?
- What is the difference between mild surprise and annoyance-based prediction errors and belief in delusions of reference?

# Some Context For That NYT Sugar Article
*September 13, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/09/13/some-context-for-that-nyt-sugar-article/

## Summary
Key ideas
- New research shows that the sugar industry sponsored a study linking fat to cardiovascular disease.
- The study focused on the relative harms of sugar and saturated fat, and how sugar has been blamed for fueling the obesity crisis.
- Concentrating on any one example of low-level corruption is likely to lead to overcorrection.
- The dairy and meat industries tend to have researchers who support saturated fat.

Key learnings
- There are problems with both sugar and fat, and it's likely they both contribute to obesity and other health issues.
- The fat lobby and the dairy and meat industries are also involved in nutrition research.
- The food industry has a lot of power to shape scientific discussions through published review papers in prominent journals.

Key questions
- Who funds nutrition research and how does this affect the findings?
- What other industries are involved in the nutrition research and how do they distort the science?
- What broader economic and political systems shape the food industry's power and influence over nutrition research and public health policies?

# SSC Endorses Clinton, Johnson, Or Stein
*September 28, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/09/28/ssc-endorses-clinton-johnson-or-stein/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The chance of a single vote determining the US election results is small, but the potential impact of having a good president rather than a bad one is worth hundreds of billions of dollars.
- The author endorses voting for Hillary Clinton if you live in a swing state; if you live in a safe state, they endorse either Clinton, Johnson, or Stein.
- The author strongly criticizes Donald Trump and argues he does not represent the best parts of conservatism.
- Trump is high-variance, meaning there is a higher potential for catastrophic consequences if he becomes president.
- Clinton is higher-variance on immigration, which could make the world less functional and prevent useful technologies from being deployed.
- The author, Scott, argues that a Trump presidency would be disastrous for the US and the conservative movement.
- Trump's anti-immigration policies would have a greater impact on the country and its technologies than Hillary's policies.
- The lack of intelligent conservatives represents a crisis for US conservatism.
- Trump's rise is due to a feeling of resentment toward an intolerant elite.
- The enemy is not leftism or social justice, but rather epistemic vice, which Trump's movement is promoting.

Key learnings:
- Voting can have a significant impact even if the chance of one vote determining the election results is small.
- It's important to consider not just a candidate's ability to pursue goals effectively, but also whether you agree with the goals they'll be pursuing.
- High variance candidates, like Donald Trump, come with greater levels of risk.
- It's important to consider not just the mean but also the variance of the potential consequences of a candidate becoming president.
- Voting for the lesser of two evils means choosing Hillary over Trump.
- US conservatism is in crisis, and defeating Trump may be the start of resolving this crisis.
- Whichever party wins the support of religious poor southern whites will end up vulnerable to populism.

Key questions:
- How can we accurately measure a candidate's ability to pursue goals effectively and make good choices?
- How can we balance the potential risks of a high-variance candidate with the potential benefits?
- What is the best way to address the issue of immigration without sacrificing world functionality and the deployment of useful technologies?
- How can conservatism resolve its crisis if it is always going to be less intellectual than liberalism in the country?
- To what extent should the chances of global warming being a real problem should have an impact on reducing CO2 emissions?
- Will a Trump presidency hurt the group of elites who are skeptical of his candidacy, or will it confirm what they already believe?

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Various interesting and diverse facts and stories are presented, such as the decline of bowling in the US, how markets punish discrimination, and the history of cursive writing.

Key learnings:
- There may be a biological reason for the surplus of men in mathematical fields, but this argument may be arbitrary.
- Sweatshops in the Third World may increase employment opportunity, but more empirical evidence is needed.
- Discrimination against minorities in the hiring process can lead to higher rates of business failure for the discriminating companies.

Key questions:

# Somewhat Against Psychiatric Conditions As Domestication Failure
*October 11, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/10/11/somewhat-against-psychiatric-conditions-as-domestication-failure/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Benitez-Burraco and Lattanzi theorize that autism and schizophrenia are anomalies in the human self-domestication process
- Similar changes occur in any species bred for tameness due to changes in the embryonic neural crest
- BBL argues that autistic people are “undomesticated humans” and schizophrenics are “hyperdomesticated humans”
- The theory proposes that domesticated animals are friendlier and less aggressive, but schizophrenics aren't friendlier or less aggressive, unlike domesticated animals

Key learnings
- Domestication seems to be linked to a physiological social/trust system that determines the level of trust and sociability and is linked to ear and nose shape
- Autism, schizophrenia, and Williams Syndrome all affect that system in different ways
- Embryology can help pinpoint the particular systems involved in autism and schizophrenia

Key questions
- How could embryological research help pinpoint the particular systems involved in autism and schizophrenia?
- Could a version of Williams Syndrome that only deleted WBSCR17 keep the behavioral and physiologic changes but not much else?

# More Hardball Debate Questions
*October 13, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/10/13/more-hardball-debate-questions/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Jill Stein advocates for eating organic food and blames increasing pesticide exposure for developmental disorders in American children.
- Hillary Clinton emphasizes the relevance of implicit bias as a problem for police officers and police shootings.
- Donald Trump's campaign CEO, Steve Bannon, was the acting director of Biosphere 2, and the experiment did not succeed.

Key learnings
- Jill Stein promotes organic food, but mainstream scientists and media outlets criticize it, claiming that organic food is no healthier than conventionally grown food.
- While Clinton and her running mate promote the focus on implicit bias as relevant to policing, more rigorous studies show that the implicit association test (IAT) that tests implicit bias is not a good predictor of racism.
- Stein correlates the increasing exposure to pesticides with developmental disorders in children.

Key questions
- Do Vox's claims about organic food and pesticides make them complicit in childhood neurodevelopmental disorders?
- Would Clinton take an Implicit Association Test to measure how easily she associates her name with the adjective "crooked?"
- Should the public be scared of Steve Bannon's involvement in destroying Biosphere 2?

# The Heart Has Its Reasons That Reason Knows Not Of
*October 21, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/10/21/the-heart-has-its-reasons-that-reason-knows-not-of/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Psychoanalysts propose that sons are attracted to women that resemble their mothers as they use them as a schema for their ideal woman.
- Research has shown that sexual selection is based on learned imprinting, at least in animals whose names start with "zebra fi".
- Studies ​also suggest human mate preferences are driven by sexual imprinting across diverse traits of race, age, and lactation status.
- Previous twin studies were unable to prove a genetic or family environmental influence on mate choice.
- Mate choice is still a curious and disquieting conclusion as there is no proof​ of a genetic or family environmental influence in humans.

Key learnings:
- There is a lot of evidence suggesting that animals learn mate preference via imprinting.
- Humans may choose mates based on some form of imprinting process resembling the roles played by their opposite-sex parent.
- True love and romantic infatuation may be driving forces behind choosing a mate.

Key questions:
- Do sons really get attracted to women who look like their mother, or is it a genetic influence?
- How much impact do early childhood experiences with parents have on a person's mate preference?
- How does sexual imprinting apply to other fetishes like adult baby fetishes?
- Are family environmental and genetic factors the only driving forces behind mate preference?

# AI Persuasion Experiment Results
*October 24, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/10/24/ai-persuasion-experiment-results/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The author conducted an experiment to determine if online essays could change people's minds about complicated, controversial topics.
- The experiment showed that people's concerns regarding AI risk increased by an average of 0.5 points on a ten-point scale after reading the essays.
- The five different essays did not have significant differences in their ability to persuade people, and the level of knowledge about AI risk did not significantly alter the results.
- Mostly, the effects of the experiment persist after a month, and any essay can be used to persuade people.

Key learnings:
- Essays can change people's minds about complicated, controversial topics.
- People's existing knowledge of a topic may not affect their susceptibility to change their minds.
- There is a modest but useful effect of trying to persuade people.

Key questions:
- Can online essays change people's minds about other complicated, controversial topics?
- What are the features of an essay that can or cannot change people's minds?
- Can we determine who is easiest or hardest to persuade with a certain type of essay?

# How Does Recent AI Progress Affect The Bostromian Paradigm?
*October 30, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/10/30/how-does-recent-ai-progress-affect-the-bostromian-paradigm/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The AI risk discourse is centered around AIs as strategic creatures that maximize pre-programmed goals.
- Most of the latest advances in machine learning have been engaging with the neural network, arranged in "cells" that peruse the image and conceptualize it into elements, items and themes.
- The Engineer's and Biologist's approaches towards AGI could be opposing. While the former believes AGI will require a different kind of programming, the Biologist's perspective is that we can learn from the brain's evolution and composition to create AGI.
- Categorization, abstraction, and difficulty between the perception/motivation/ cognition systems are mixed, as exemplified by the "edge" cases of what is defined as a "bird".
 
Key learnings:
- Recent advancements in machine learning have been heavily engaged in neural networks.
- AI categories can be made in the same way as humans.
- The perception/motivation/cognition differentiation is not as deeply separated in the brain's systems as previously believed, and in fact, could tie into agents' desires and their incentives. 

Key questions:
- Do recent advancements in neural networks change the paradigm of the Bostromian approach to understanding AI?
- How far are advancements towards creating an AGI or human-level intelligence? 
- How different will a tangible AGI program be if it has been created based on the same principles and codes as a neural net?
- How might humans learn morality the same way as illustrated by the example of adopting parenting or religious practices?

# The Pyramid And The Garden
*November 5, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/11/05/the-pyramid-and-the-garden/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The Great Pyramid of Giza has been claimed to encode the speed of light to seven decimal places, but in reality, the coincidence only involves four decimal places of the latitude number.
- The pseudoscientists who discovered the coincidence had many degrees of freedom to manipulate, which exponentially increases the number of lottery tickets they had to win a one-in-a-million chance.
- The author questions whether other variables, such as the longitude or the color of the stones used to build the Pyramid, should be taken into account to properly evaluate the coincidence.

Key learnings:
- Coincidences with low probabilities can still occur if the pseudoscientists behind the discovery had many degrees of freedom to manipulate.
- When evaluating coincidences, it's important to consider all variables that could be at play and not just the ones included in the original hypothesis.

Key questions:
- Should the author include other variables, such as the color of the stones used to build the Pyramid, in the evaluation of the coincidence?
- How can researchers avoid the risk of seeing a coincidence where there is none when they have many degrees of freedom to manipulate in their study?
- Is it fair to count all the different hypotheses and degrees of freedom when evaluating a coincidence, or should only the ones presented in the original hypothesis be considered?

# Tuesday Shouldn’t Change The Narrative
*November 7, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/11/07/tuesday-shouldnt-change-the-narrative/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Predictions for the 2016 US election from sources like New York Times and 538 vary.
- There are many factors that can affect the outcome of the election, such as unforeseen events or unpredictable public opinion shifts.
- The author suggests that rather than attributing victory to grand narratives like nationalism, people should acknowledge that political fundamentals and noise make either party's victory feasible.

Key learnings
- The results of the 2016 US election were unpredictable, meaning the outcome is not always representative of grand narratives or societal trends.
- No prediction can account for every factor that may influence an election outcome.

Key questions 
- How much should we rely on predictions for a given election?
- Should we attribute election outcomes to broader societal trends or recognize them as the result of individual factors?
- How do unpredictable factors impact the outcome of elections?

*November 10, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/11/10/book-review-house-of-god/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- "The House of God" is a book about medical internship which accentuates the reality of medical professionals.
- The story revolves around an obvious author-insert character, Roy Basch MD, who starts his internship year at a hospital called the House of God.
- Medical intervention can only make patients worse in the fictional world of "The House of God".
- The primary form of medical treatment in the novel is the TURF – the excuse to get a patient out of your care and on to somebody else’s.
- The House of God does a weird form of figure-ground inversion of medicine by inverting commonly held assumptions.
- House of God is a book that portrays medicine as a chaotic and often inhumane system
- The book has had an impact in helping to change the medical education system, reduce patient falls, and encourage more empathy and communication skills among doctors
- The book's characters struggle to balance their human compassion with the demands of the medical system

Key learnings:
- Medicine is magical realist and life-and-death stakes are an everyday reality.
- Medical intervention can only make patients worse in some cases.
- The primary form of medical treatment in the novel is the TURF.
- The courage to speak the truth can have a powerful impact in challenging oppressive systems
- Medical practices and training have improved since the book was written, but there is still room for improvement
- Psychoanalysis is a key framework for understanding the psychological toll of medical training and practice

Key questions:
- What are the laws of the House of God?
- Is it ethical for Dr. Basch to prevent his patients from getting any treatment?
- What is the Black Crow?
- How can medical training and practice be reformed to prioritize empathy, compassion, and patient-centered care?
- What role do medical professionals have in advocating for better healthcare policies and systems?
- How can literature and storytelling help us better understand and critique oppressive systems?

# You Are Still Crying Wolf
*November 16, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/11/16/you-are-still-crying-wolf/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The author argues that the accusations of Trump being racist or a white supremacist are exaggerated and unsupported by evidence.
- Trump's official campaign message was consistent with a desire to appeal to and protect the interests of minorities.
- The author asserts that there are too few white supremacists to have much of an impact on the election.
- There are multiple online communities associated with the alt-right movement, including /r/altright, Stormfront, and 4chan’s politics board.
- The total number of people in the online US alt-right community is estimated to be in the mid five-digits, around 50,000 or so.
- White supremacist attitudes are held by a small minority of Americans, based on several polls that examine issues like school segregation and discriminatory laws.
- Many accusations against Trump of racism and bigotry are exaggerated or misleading.
- Trump's rhetoric on immigration follows similar themes as both Democrats and Republicans in the past.
- Trump supporters often hold a different view of immigration as a privilege granted by community members rather than a right.
- Accusations of Trump's racism can sometimes be a result of interpreting his weirdness and bizarre behavior in an overly sinister manner.
- The natural pattern of refuting false theories involves finding alternative interpretations for every point made by the theory's supporters
- Trump's rhetoric has caused fear and anxiety in some individuals, including suicidal ideation in some of the author's patients
- The media's portrayal of Trump as a "white nationalist" and fearmongering about his policies are counterproductive and unnecessary

Key learnings:
- The media's characterization of Trump as openly racist or a white supremacist is not supported by polling data or Trump's campaign message.
- The author believes that the media's fixation on Trump's alleged racism has been a distraction from his other shortcomings and is a symptom of larger problems in political discourse.
- The alt-right movement is relatively small and not a significant voting bloc or political force.
- White supremacist attitudes are becoming less common in the population, with their support declining over the years.
- Claims of racism, sexism, or white nationalism are usually not based on specific events but on perceived indicators of an implied set of beliefs and motives.
- Trump's supporters' concerns about national security and immigration should not be ignored or dismissed as pure racism.
- Facts need to be evaluated in context, and context has many different layers that are not always consistent with the interpretation that some political factions believe.
- It is important to approach false theories and beliefs by refuting each individual point with evidence and alternative explanations
- Fearmongering and sensationalism in the media can cause harm to individuals and propagate harmful beliefs
- Predictions and accountability can improve accuracy and reduce fear and uncertainty about the future

Key questions:
- Have accusations of racism against past Republican candidates been overblown?
- Why is the media so fixated on accusations of racism against Trump?
- How significant is the presence of white supremacists in American political discourse, and how much do they influence elections?
- How do white supremacist attitudes vary based on location, class, etc.?
- How much of an impact, if any, will the alt-right movement have on US politics and society in the future?
- How can we address the continuing problem of racism in the US?
- How do accusations of racism, sexism, or white nationalism get perpetuated in public and political discourse?
- What is the significance of immigrants being perceived as a privilege rather than just a right?
- How do the differing interpretations of facts and events lead to different ideological frameworks and political biases, and how can these be bridged?
- How can we address and combat fear and anxiety caused by political rhetoric?
- How can the media more responsibly report on politics and current events?
- How can we approach the principles of accountability and accuracy in everyday life and decision-making?

# The Alzheimer Photo
*November 17, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/11/17/the-alzheimer-photo/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The photo of Alois Alzheimer and his colleagues in Munich shows the discovery of several neurological diseases.
- Alzheimer's lab was on the bleeding edge of advances in neurology and psychiatry due to good histological staining, being in the right place at the right time, and Kraepelin's organizational and funding skills.
- The natural tendency for an institution to gain a reputation for being the best and then attract the best people also played a role in the success.

Key learnings
- The last few decades haven't been great for neuropsychiatry.
- It's easier to pick low-hanging fruit in one paradigm than to get entirely new ones. 
- Eventually, all the stuff that was easy to discover this way got discovered, and there just aren't any equally fruitful paradigms coming to our attention.

Key questions
- Why did the discovery of neurological diseases in the late 19th and early 20th century come out of one lab?
- Do paradigms in science need to shift in order for new discoveries to emerge?
- Why has neuropsychiatry stagnated in recent decades?

# SSC Journal Club: Expert Prediction Of Experiments
*November 27, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/11/27/ssc-journal-club-expert-prediction-of-experiments/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The study aims to determine if people with expertise in a field are better than non-experts in predicting the best outcome of incentive schemes in a behavioral economics experiment.
- Knowledgeable academics have an advantage in predicting outcomes of the experiment, but the edge is not significant and with enough exceptions that it's worth discussing.
- Experts were better than non-experts in guessing the exact score for each condition, but not any better at guessing which conditions would do better or worse relative to one another.
- Even a little "wisdom of crowds" was enough to overwhelm the expert advantage.
- Having even a little knowledge of individuals' forecasting ability screened off expert status.

Key learnings:
- Being clever and having a rationality skill are more crucial than expertise in predicting best outcomes of an experiment.
- MBA students performed worse than the undergrads despite being highly intelligent and from a top business school, which is a fatal flaw to an IQ-based explanation.
- The experts thought their prestige and knowledge would benefit them but they were wrong.

Key questions:
- Are there any theories of psychology or economics that could help people predict how an incentive experiment would go?
- How reliable are pundits or experts in predicting outcomes that are vaguely related to their field?
- Can we place the decision-making process entirely in the hands of people from top business schools?

# Contra Robinson On Schooling
*December 2, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/12/02/contra-robinson-on-schooling/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Nathan Robinson argues against school vouchers as a solution to education issues.
- Robinson argues that introducing profit into the school system is dangerous.
- Robinson claims introducing profit creates a set of incentives that harms students.
- Robinson suggests school vouchers will benefit mainly the wealthy.
- The argument that private schools are obsessed with profit is focused on money and acknowledges that every dollar going to shareholders is a dollar not going to improving education or housing the homeless.
- Though he disagrees with the specific arguments made about the virtues of vouchers, the author is concerned about the potential consequences of vouchers and charter schools in practice.
- The author argues that vocational training, a renewed commitment to public schooling, and investing in early education would be better alternatives to vouchers.
- School vouchers may be a good solution to improve education outcomes and reduce segregation in housing.
- The lack of good competition is a major issue for industries such as education.
- Allowing random people to open tiny schools could be a solution.
- Home-schooled students do much better than traditionally schooled students.
- The cost of schooling per student year can be reduced significantly.

Key learnings:
- Often criticism of the opponent's position is insufficient to change minds.
- Expanding options for parents doesn't necessarily lead to better results for students.
- Public education spending increased by 150% from 1970 to 2010 with unclear benefits.
- The hospital case study indicates that for-profit hospitals are not noticeably better than not-for-profit ones.
- It is unlikely that blatant kickbacks would be used with vouchers, but the author acknowledges the potential of schools emphasizing flashy advertising over substantive educational outcomes.
- Vouchers could worsen class segregation and result in a lack of socioeconomic diversity in schools.
- Let's experiment with school vouchers and different possibilities to understand and find a solution that works.
- Lack of good competition is indeed the bane of all of these sorts of industries.
- Allowing random people to open tiny schools can be a solution to the lack of competition.

Key questions:
- What is the conservative argument for school vouchers and how does Robinson respond?
- How have college and primary education costs risen in the US without sufficient clarity on where the money went?
- Do private schools also lose significant resources to inefficiency and bureaucracy like public schools?
- What impact would vouchers have on educational outcomes for students from different socioeconomic backgrounds?
- What are the potential unintended consequences of vouchers for public schooling?
- How can the US improve the public schooling system without solely relying on vouchers and private institutions?
- Can school vouchers destroy the incentive to overspend on/segregate housing in order to get into a “good school district”?
- Would school vouchers worsen the quality of education?
- How much does lack of good competition matter in the education system?
- Can allowing random people to open tiny schools improve education outcomes?
- What is the solution to the high cost of schooling per student year?

# Highlights From The Comment Thread On School Choice
*December 4, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/12/04/highlights-from-the-comment-thread-on-school-choice/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Several people dispute the meaning of "nonprofit" and "for-profit" in certain situations, such as hospitals.
- Misbehaving students are not the sole cause of rising education costs.
- Increasing spending in various categories increases the cost of higher education, including "student life," "academic support," and "institutional support."
- There are debates about the effectiveness of school vouchers, with some noting that they may lead to higher grades but not better education.

Key learnings:
- There is debate about the effectiveness and definition of nonprofit and for-profit organizations in certain fields.
- There are various factors that contribute to rising education costs, including increased spending in non-instructional categories.
- The nature of what consumers want in education may contribute to pedagogical issues.
- There are debates about the effectiveness of school vouchers and challenges to finding education solutions.

Key questions:
- What are the best ways to experiment with solutions to education and other issues?
- What incentives might lead to effective decision-making in education? 
- How do we define certain terms in relation to different fields? 
- How do we make sure consumer interest doesn't outweigh the actual quality of education options?

# Thin Air
*December 5, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/12/05/thin-air/

## Summary
Key ideas
- A study found a correspondence between US topography and US obesity rates; people living at sea level are five times more likely to be obese than those living at 500m elevation, regardless of controlling factors.
- Altitude anorexia, an acute effect experienced when lowland people go to high altitudes causing weight loss, possibly due to hypoxia, is being studied for potential long-term weight loss solutions.
- The active ingredient of altitude seems to be hypoxia, where reduced oxygen seems to make people eat less.
- There are theories CO2 and global warming caused the obesity epidemic, but conflicting studies.
- Xenoestrogens and gut microbiota are blamed for obesity.

Key learnings
- People living at sea level are more likely to be obese than those living at 500m elevation not because of poverty, population density or even physical exercise.
- Altitude anorexia may play a role in understanding how high altitude may affect weight loss.
- Hypoxia from reduced oxygen contributes to affecting eating habits in people.
- CO2 and global warming theories have been proposed for causing the obesity epidemic, but there is not enough data to support the argument.
- Obesity could be caused by chemical and biological factors, such as xenoestrogens and gut microbiota.

Key questions
- Why does the body lose weight after experiencing altitude anorexia?
- What other factors could contribute to obesity other than those studied?
- What effect does low-oxygen environments have on weight gain or loss in people?
- Is there conclusive evidence that CO2 and global warming have contributed to the obesity epidemic?
- What are the other low-contrarian theories on the cause of obesity?

# Might People On The Internet Sometimes Lie?
*December 12, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/12/12/might-people-on-the-internet-sometimes-lie/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Reddit threads illustrate far-fetched claims about telepathic contact, cryptid sightings, UFOs, etc.
- Hypothesis: one million people view Reddit daily, 10% from those see posts with fake claims
- If even 1/10,000 people on the Internet are annoying trolls who post one fake story per thread for the lulz, then that's enough to make convincing stories that are, in fact, lies
- Interesting things are usually lies, such as crusades against real evils, surprising-if-true stories, and bad science
- The problem with non-replicable science is that some people are sloppy, biased, or stumble upon wrong methodologies that give lots of false positives, driving out the truth-tellers

Key learnings:
- Communities big enough to include even a few liars, without a strong mechanism to stop them, will have lies rising to the top
- It is difficult to believe that some people are just liars, even though their stories are far-fetched and unlikely to be true

Key questions:
- Why is it so hard to believe that people in Reddit threads are liars, despite their stories being improbable and having little evidence to back them up?
- What are the other factors aside from annoying trolls that contribute to the posting of fake stories in forums and websites?
- How can one discern whether a story is just a coincidence or a weird psychological trick, or if it is an actual paranormal or telepathic experience?

# SSC Journal Club: Mental Disorders As Networks
*December 14, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/12/14/ssc-journal-club-mental-disorders-as-networks/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Psychiatry has traditionally used the influenza model to diagnose mental illness, assuming that there is a latent variable causing a cluster of symptoms.
- However, the authors of the paper propose that there is no latent variable, and instead suggest a network model where each symptom is a node that is connected to others with certain weights.
- This network model explains how life stressors can cause depression, as well as how therapy and treating depression symptoms can help alleviate the condition.
- The model also explains the polygenic structure of mental illnesses and why scientists have had difficulty finding the One True Cause of Depression.
- Ambien helps with sleep but not underlying dysfunction related to poor sleep
- Psychiatric problems can have multiple causes and not One True Cause
- Dysfunction in biological systems can explain psychiatric problems

Key learnings:
- Psychiatric disorders are often diagnosed through clusters of symptoms, but treatment focused on the underlying latent variable may not always be effective.
- A network model where each symptom is connected to others through pathways with certain weights could provide a better understanding of mental illnesses and how they develop.
- The network model can explain how life stressors can cause depression, how treating depression symptoms can help alleviate the condition, and the polygenic structure of mental illnesses.
- Ambien only treats the symptom of poor sleep, not the underlying dysfunction
- Psychiatric problems can have multiple causes, making it hard to find a single solution
- Dysfunction in biological systems may explain the causes of psychiatric problems

Key questions:
- Are there any psychiatric disorders that do not fit the network model proposed by Nuijten, Deserno, Cramer, and Borsboom?
- How does the network model explain the immediate and near-miraculous antidepressant effects of ketamine and staying awake for 30 hours straight?
- Would treating depression through a symptom-by-symptom cocktail of drugs be effective under the network model?
- How can we better understand the dysfunction in biological systems that can lead to psychiatric problems?
- What are the best avenues for future research in this area?
- Is it feasible to reduce complex psychiatric problems to a single brain region or chemical level?

# Links 12/16: The Site Before Christmas
*December 23, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/12/23/links-1216-the-site-before-christmas/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Jews should avoid some specific areas in the Pacific that are confusing for observing Shabbat.
- Private hospitals and public hospitals are equally good (bad) in India but private hospitals are only 1/4 as expensive. 
- Several arguments for and against the effectiveness of earlier school starting ages. 
- Investigative journalism reports private mental hospitals admitting non-hospitalization needing patients to profit their business.
- The collapse of the Soviet Union led to mild food shortages in Cuba, leading to the country being a natural laboratory for health benefits of losing weight. 

Key learnings
- Bias in mainstream news sources are not as pronounced as we think but a few outlets with obviously biased leanings such as Daily Kos and Breitbart. 
- Bias exists in introductory psychology textbooks, and some urban scientific legends are passed on as true. 
- A study shows that female doctors deliver slightly better care than male doctors in certain situations. 

Key questions
- What are the reasons for earlier school starting ages increasing crime and obesity?
- How could building in French Polynesian sovereign waters be better than just building a charter city on land with the approval of the government? 
- Why does private healthcare cost less in India than in the US?
- What factors explain female doctors providing better care in some situations?

# Book Review: Mount Misery
*December 29, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/12/29/book-review-mount-misery/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Mount Misery is the sequel to Samuel Shem’s House of God.
- It is a critique of the psychiatric system and its harmful effects on patients and doctors.
- The book shows how the typical psychiatric treatment is to force a therapy theory onto patients, and then ignore their human needs.
- The book depicts psychoanalysis as a powerful yet dangerous process that makes people worse.
- The book "Mount Misery" critiques psychoanalysis and praises Alcoholics Anonymous.
- There is danger in avoiding object-level discussion in favor of meta-level discussion.
- Some people may experience greater success with social interventions like AA than others due to individual differences.
- Shem emphasizes the importance of connecting with patients through human relationships rather than solely relying on therapies and medication.

Key learnings:
- Psychoanalysis can be powerful and effective, but in the wrong hands, or with the wrong approach, it can be dangerous for both patients and doctors.
- The psychiatric system is flawed and harms patients by treating them more like guinea pigs than human beings.
- Treating patients as human beings with individual needs, rather than just trying to slap a therapy theory on them, could result in better outcomes.
- Object-level discussion is essential for complicated social discussion.
- Different people may respond differently to social interventions like AA.
- It is important to combine therapies and medication with genuine care for the patient as a human being.

Key questions:
- How can the psychiatric system be reformed to better serve patients?
- Is psychoanalysis inherently dangerous or are there specific ways it can be misused?
- How can doctors balance object-level discussion with the as-if game of psychoanalysis?
- Is there a danger to avoiding object-level discussion in other areas besides psychoanalysis?
- How might individual differences affect the success of social interventions like AA?
- How can psychiatrists balance the complicated work of psychiatric treatment with treating patients like human beings?

# Contra NYT On Economists On Education
*December 30, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/12/30/contra-nyt-on-economists-on-education/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The New York Times article claimed that economists generally do not support a free market for education.
- The article cited a Chicago panel of leading economists who disagreed with implementing a voucher system for education.
- Economists are trained to recognize market failures and the need for government intervention when necessary.

Key learnings
- Only 36% of economists surveyed agreed that implementing a voucher system would improve education.
- A majority of economists who have an opinion are pro-voucher, compared to only 19% who disagree.
- The NYT article falsely implies that there is an economic consensus against implementing a voucher system for education.

Key questions
- What other academic fields might have different perspectives on implementing a voucher system for education?
- How might a voucher system for education impact different socioeconomic classes?
- What alternative solutions might economists suggest for improving the education system?

*December 31, 2016*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/12/31/addendum-to-economists-on-education/

# Heuristics Work Until They Don’t
*January 11, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/01/11/heuristics-work-until-they-dont/

## Summary
Key ideas
- AI researchers were surprised by recent progress due to past failures and a heuristic that progress would always be slower than expected.
- Forming heuristics based on only a few examples can lead to misinterpretation of noise and inaccurate predictions.
- Mitt Romney's loss in 2012 was due to a private narrative of decreased minority turnout that was unsupported by real polls.
- The 2016 election showed that arrogant fools do not always get their comeuppance, and the lesson of Moneyball does not necessarily apply to all domains.

Key learnings
- It is important to avoid forming strong heuristics based on a small number of data points.
- Misinterpretation of noise can lead to inaccurate predictions and misguided decision-making.
- Life should not be treated as a series of moral parables, and each situation should be evaluated based on its own evidence.

Key questions
- Is it possible to avoid forming strong heuristics altogether, or are they a natural part of human decision-making?
- How can we balance our reliance on statistics and hard data with the insights gained from real-life experience and domain knowledge?
- In what situations is it appropriate to form generalizations or heuristics based on a smaller set of data points, and how can we ensure they are accurate?

# Why Do Test Scores Plateau?
*January 13, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/01/13/why-do-test-scores-plateau/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The author compares standardized test scores for residents in internal medicine, psychiatry, and surgery.
- Individuals tend to learn the most in their first year and less every following year.
- The author suggests that individual differences in intelligence and interest likely affect exam scores. 

Key learnings
- Year of education is an important factor relative to individual differences but quickly becomes irrelevant.
- People learn the most in their first year and less every following year.
- Residents in a given specialty work about the same number of hours, see about the same sorts of patients, and yet still get very different scores on their exams.

Key questions (Scott's questions)
- Might it be a simple ceiling effect? 
- Might it be that final-year residents stop caring? 
- Might it be that programs stop teaching residents after three years or so? 
- Might it be that residents only learn by seeing patients and there's only a certain number of kinds of patients that they see regularly? 
- What is the reason for individuals to get very different scores on their exams in the same specialty?

# Another Followup To “Economists On Education”
*January 17, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/01/17/another-followup-to-economists-on-education/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Last month, Scott argued about the misrepresentation of economists' views on school vouchers in a news article.
- He proposed an experiment to settle the disagreement about the article and offered a bet to some people who disagreed with him.
- The experiment involved showing the article to random people and asking them if economists support or oppose privatizing education.
- The results of two separate surveys showed that most people misinterpreted the article to mean that economists oppose privatization.
- Scott won the bet and settled the disagreement.

Key learnings
- An article can mislead readers into thinking that it is conveying a consensus when it is not.
- Empirical evidence can settle disagreements more decisively than arguments.
- An experiment can provide an opportunity for people to test their beliefs.

Key questions
- How can readers avoid being misled by news articles that claim to convey a consensus of experts?
- What are the limitations of using surveys to test people's comprehension of an article?
- How can disagreements about the meaning of an article be settled more conclusively?

# Watch New Health Picks
*January 18, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/01/18/watch-new-health-picks/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Trump's health care picks, particularly those for FDA commissioner, are potentially interesting.
- Jim O'Neill and Balaji Srinavasan are possible candidates for FDA commissioner who are part of the second cluster of libertarians interested in using competition to kindle innovation and help regular people.
- O'Neill and Srinavasan could implement policies such as medical reciprocity with Europe, a less burdensome approval process for generic medications, and a stop to practices that let companies "steal" popular drugs and jack up prices.
- John Ioannidis, a Stanford statistician, is a potential candidate for NIH chief and promotes high-quality studies in medical research.

Key learnings
- Medical reciprocity with Europe could provide an immediate windfall of dozens of drugs with unimpeachable records for almost no cost.
- A less burdensome approval process for generic medications could lower the price of many medications by an order of magnitude and prevent scandals like Daraprim and EpiPens.
- O'Neill's proposal to approve drugs based on safety but not efficacy could increase academic studies and good judgement in drug approvals as well as be a bold revolutionary high-variance bad idea.
- Having high scientific standards in US medical research could be accomplished by appointing John Ioannidis as NIH chief.

Key questions
- Who are some of Trump's other health care picks besides those mentioned in the post and what are their backgrounds?
- What are some of the arguments against implementing O'Neill's proposal to approve drugs based on safety but not efficacy?
- What other policies could O'Neill and Srinavasan potentially implement if appointed as FDA commissioner?

# Link: Guyenet On Taubes
*January 26, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/01/26/link-guyenet-on-taubes/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Gary Taubes believes that sugar is the only factor that causes Western noncommunicable diseases (NCDs).
- There are cultures that consume high amounts of sugar without suffering from NCDs.
- Taubes argues that calorie content is not the main determinant of body fatness, but this argument is not supported by metabolic ward studies.
- Taubes overlooks evidence that contradicts his theories and instead favors questionable evidence in support of his claims.
- Taubes' discussion of the history of research on sugar, fat, and obesity is one-sided and uses historical narratives as a substitute for evidence.

Key learnings:
- Excess sugar intake alone may not necessarily cause NCDs.
- Calorie content is the main determinant of body fatness.
- Certain claims made by Gary Taubes are not supported by evidence.

Key questions:
- What evidence exists to support Taubes' claims about sugar and its relationship to obesity and NCDs?
- Why does Taubes overlook evidence that contradicts his theories?
- What role do lifestyle factors aside from sugar intake play in the development of obesity and NCDs?

# Dogs And Wolves: In Defense Of Some Past Posts
*January 29, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/01/29/dogs-and-wolves-in-defense-of-some-past-posts/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The author has consistently criticized Trump and is not a supporter of him.
- The author opposes interpreting candidates' statements as secret codes or dog whistles to reveal their true beliefs.
- The author acknowledges that Trump planned to ban immigrants from some Muslim countries during his campaign and that this is consistent with his previously stated beliefs.
- The author argues against using extreme terms, such as "KKK white nationalism" and "overt white supremacy" to describe Trump, but acknowledges that he holds some racist attitudes and policies.

Key learnings
- Listening to what Trump specifically says he is going to do is the best way to predict his policies.
- Using ambiguous terms such as "racism" to describe Trump can prevent understanding of the actual issues.
- Exaggerating and using extreme terms to describe Trump's beliefs can be dangerous and counterproductive.

Key questions
- Why do some people accuse the author of supporting or being lukewarm on disliking Trump?
- Why do some people believe that Trump's actions, such as the ban on immigrants from some Muslim countries, validate their belief in dog whistles?
- How can people constructively fight against Trump's policies without resorting to extreme language?

# Book Review: Eichmann In Jerusalem
*January 30, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/01/30/book-review-eichmann-in-jerusalem/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Hannah Arendt's "Eichmann in Jerusalem"
- Adolf Eichmann was involved in organizing logistics for the Holocaust
- Eichmann claimed to be "banal" and did not have a specific larger-than-himself belief
- Eichmann's psychological profile was incapable of thinking from someone else's point of view
- Arendt's interpretation of "the Final Solution" as meaning the last of many solutions to be tried
- The Nazis contemplated emigration and resettlement as preliminary plans to the eventual genocide.
- Eichmann's early involvement with the Jewish Question was in emigration, in which he forced wealthy Jews to pay extra for their poorer co-religionists.
- Countries worldwide closed their doors to Jewish refugees, which ultimately led to the Second Solution of resettlement.
- The Jewish Councils in Europe during the Holocaust were not always complicit collaborators, but sometimes saw cooperation as a way to mitigate damage.
- The goal of Israeli authorities in conducting the Eichmann trial was to send the message that Jews could never be safe among Gentiles.
- The Israeli leadership felt a driving duty to communicate this message, in order to avoid future generations being seduced by the idea of negotiating with Gentiles.
- Arendt argues that the reason why people didn't say no to the Holocaust was because there was little genuine opposition to Hitler and the Final Solution.
- Humanizing the Nazis' evil makes it harder to distinguish it from lesser evils of today.
- The author explores the reasons for the difference in behavior of citizens in different countries during WWII.
- He considers how fascist ideologies are still present in modern populism.
- The author concludes that resistance from citizens against fascism can be effective in stopping the regime.

Key learnings:
- The Holocaust and Eichmann's trial highlight the danger of following orders without questioning their morality
- The dangers of groupthink and how it can lead to atrocities
- The difficulties in understanding the psychology of those responsible for perpetrating atrocities
- The Nazi's intentions to get rid of the Jews had multiple stages.
- Eichmann's role in the Jewish Question was larger than previously thought.
- Millions of Jews could have been saved if countries worldwide had cooperated to take in Jewish refugees.
- Refugee policies were crucial in exacerbating the Holocaust, as Western nations failed to accept refugees from Nazi Germany.
- The Final Solution was not the Nazis' first plan, but their third or fourth, and humanizing their evil makes it closer to the lesser evils of today.
- The Eichmann trial was not only about broadcasting the horrors of the Holocaust, but also about sending a message to future generations.
- Culture is inadequate in explaining why some countries cooperated with Final Solution while others resisted it.
- Tiny differences in initial conditions can compound and lead to very different end states.
- Resistance from the general population of occupied countries can stop the fascist regime.

Key questions:
- What is the role of individual responsibility in perpetrating atrocities?
- How can we combat groupthink and ensure that individuals actively question orders that may be immoral?
- What can we learn from the Eichmann trial to inform current political climates and prevent future atrocities?
- How did the Second Solution develop from emigration and resettlement?
- What obstacles did the Nazis face in implementing emigration and resettlement?
- Why did other countries refuse to take in Jewish refugees?
- Why did some Jewish Councils negotiate and cooperate with the Nazis, even when it didn't benefit their communities?
- How does the Israeli leadership's driving duty to communicate the incommunicable truth affect the country's policies today?
- What factors led to the lack of genuine opposition to Hitler and the Final Solution?
- How can we prevent the lessons of the Holocaust from being lost or forgotten?
- Why did some countries' citizens act in opposite ways despite the similarity in culture?
- Can resistance from the general population change the minds of fascist regimes?
- How can a world bring up ordinary humans that can tolerate a fascist regime?

# [GUEST POST] The International Refugee Assistance Project
*February 2, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/02/guest-post-the-international-refugee-assistance-program/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The effectiveness of preparing for something that might never happen cannot always be judged by what is visible on a regular day.
- Extra reserve capacity during a crisis can be the difference between disruption and disaster.
- Partnering with other organizations can lead to the strongest campaign to achieve goals.

Key learnings
- The ground-level work done by organizations such as the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP) can make an enormous difference in the lives of individual immigrants.
- Individual cases worked on by IRAP cannot effectively be challenged in court but their work maintaining records simplifies the creation of lists of immigrants affected by new policies.
- Partnering with other organizations can lead to the strongest campaign to force policy changes.

Key questions
- How can the effectiveness of work done by organizations preparing for a crisis be evaluated?
- What other ground-level work is being done that is not glamorous but can make a significant difference in people's lives?
- Which small charities are doing ground-level work and where else can people donate to support the cause?

# Albion’s Seed, Genotyped
*February 8, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/08/albions-seed-genotyped/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Historian David Fischer's work on the four great English migrations to America helps explain modern regional patterns
- Han et al's publication uses a technique called identity-by-descent to find recent common ancestors
- The study divides the populations into natural clusters in both European-settler-focused and immigrant-focused maps
- The map shows the New Englander and Pennsylvania Quaker migrations, with less distinct signals for Borderers and Virginians

Key learnings
- The study provides hard science confirming historical speculation
- The genetic lineage contributes to the modern regional patterns

Key questions
- How much of the modern regional patterns are cultural, genetic, or gene-cultural interaction?
- What is the explanation for the three populations in the Southern/Appalachian region?
- Why don't Tidewater Virginians seem to be in the Tidewater Virginia region?
- Are Californians, Seattleites, and other "Left Coasters" displaced New Englanders?
- Is there not enough data for the Mountain West, or are they a mix of every genetic lineage?

# Considerations On Cost Disease
*February 9, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/09/considerations-on-cost-disease/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The cost of education, college, healthcare, infrastructure, and housing has significantly increased over the past 50 years, even after adjusting for inflation.
- The increase in costs is especially strange because improving technology and globalization are expected to cut costs, not increase them.
- People now have access to many opportunities that were formerly unavailable, yet the price is still much higher than before.
- Many of these services have also decreased in quality as an attempt to decrease costs even further.
- Tech improvements in one sector may push up prices in another sector.
- Health care and education costs have increased significantly over time but employee salaries have not risen much.
- Indirect government intervention through regulation may partly account for rising costs in health care and education.
- More caution and increased risk tolerance of institutions could be responsible for the increasing costs.
- The cost, in real terms, of important industries such as healthcare or education, has increased drastically over the years.
- The price increases are not matched with equivalent increases in quality and efficiency.
- The result is a generation with stagnant or declining living standards, due to the inability to keep up with the increased cost of basic human needs.
- Politics debates often revolve around how to mitigate the distribution of the losses, instead of addressing the central issue of cost increase.

Key learnings:
- The cost disease refers to increasing costs in general rather than a specific theory of why costs are increasing.
- The cost disease has been experienced in various sectors such as education, college, healthcare, infrastructure, and housing.
- Rising costs in one sector may have a ripple effect on others, even those less susceptible to tech improvements.
- Increased costs in health care and education sectors could be due to regulations and institutions' approach to risk tolerance.
- It is possible to provide the same quality of service at a fraction of the cost; hence, there is a need to scrutinize the cause of the increasing expenses.
- Ensuring universal access to healthcare or education would solve social problems but contribute to locking in the high prices of these industries.
- Political debates on issues such as taxation may mask the central problem of increased costs of basic human needs.
- The greatest anti-poverty advance would be creating a program that provides efficient healthcare, affordable education, and housing decreases.

Key questions:
- Do people understand that the cost disease exists, and the extent to which it has affected different sectors?
- Would poor and middle-class people rather get modern healthcare, education, and housing or the same as their parent's generation with modern technology and receive extra money?
- How many times more expensive would it be to receive the same quality of service in modern times without the gains from modern technology and globalization?
- How can we balance regulations in the education and health care sectors to avoid rising costs?
- What should be the appropriate approach to risk tolerance when it comes to institutions providing services in health care and education?
- Might institutions become increasingly risk-averse and institutionalized, with a lower risk tolerance over time?
- Might total compensation be increasing despite stagnant wages?
- Why are college tuitions incomparably high and why aren't people starting more colleges?
- Has the cost of human needs risen faster than wages have increased, and if so, why?

*February 14, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/14/links-217-site-your-sources/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Oliceride, a new opioid, may be much safer than morphine.
- Wellbutrin has a delayed effect, and works well after a "second wind".
- Each decile of wealth in the United States performs poorly compared to equivalent deciles in other countries, irrespective of ethnicity.
- Modafinil enhances cognitive capacity by improving attention and concentration, rather than directly enhancing IQ.
- Older fathers have more de novo mutations than younger fathers, which disproves the objection that fathers with worse genes will tend to get married later.
- New Zealand tries to figure out how Peter Thiel became a secret citizen.
- Gene drive testing thwarted when organisms develop resistance.
- Extreme protest tactics reduce popular support for social movements, because they reduce feelings of identification with the movement.
- Major accountancy firm Ernst & Young removes the requirement for employees to have a college degree.
- New phase of matter called "time crystals" has been discovered.

Key learnings:
- Oliceride, a new opioid drug, could revolutionize the way chronic pain is treated.
- It's important to wait to evaluate the effectiveness of a drug before determining its true value, as with Wellbutrin.
- The United States has a comprehensive education problem, not simply one of ethnic distribution.
- Modafinil's cognitive-enhancing properties lie in its duration of action and heightened focus.
- In older men, de novo mutations increase, meaning there is a moderate correlation between paternal age and genetic defects.
- The pursuit of power can lead to powerful immoral systems, such as Thiel's citizenship controversy.
- Gene alteration might not be as simple as in the straightforward designer-baby narrative.
- When movements resort to extreme tactics, they lose their support base and sympathy of the masses.
- Removing degree requirement in corporate job recruitment might become a norm in seeking earnest and capable candidates.
- There's a discovery of a new phase of matter which could change our understanding of physics.

Key questions:
- Can we trust new drugs to be safer than their predecessors? 
- How can we better evaluate drug effectiveness, and what problems can arise from an incomplete evaluation? 
- Is the education system broken in the United States, and if so, is it a fixable problem?
- Are the cognitive-enhancing properties of modafinil through heightened focus generalizeable to any situation? 
- Can we take the de novo mutations argument as sound evidence for a causal relationship between paternal age and genetic defects?
- What other controversies surrounding Thiel and citizenship are there?
- What else can we do to alter genes in organisms in a way that is not dangerous or ineffective? 
- How can effective protest tactics be channelled? Is there such thing as being "too extreme" in political movements? 
- Can we effectively alleviate the escalating underemployment using other recruitment tactics besides filtering candidates by their education attainment?
- What implications does this discovery of a new phase of matter have for the future?

# Highlights From The Comments On Cost Disease
*February 17, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/17/highlights-from-the-comments-on-cost-disease/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Labor productivity has declined in certain areas, causing costs to rise.
- Administrative bloat is a major contributor to this decline in labor productivity.
- Lack of competition is a key factor in the rise of the cost disease.
- Superior goods, where we have limitless demand and limited ability to judge impact, also contribute to rising costs.
- Market failures, including trickery and misinformation, are another possible explanation for high costs.
- Food market does not require heavy government intervention due to its robustness, but education, healthcare, and housing require it due to their complexity and high cost.
- Government intervention in these markets has been expensive in America, and other countries face similar problems, but at a smaller scale.
- The US government is not very good at regulation, and many factors contribute to this.
- The cost of healthcare, education, and government procurement of complex products is predicted to be excessive due to heavy government subsidies and inadequate cost regulations.
- There is evidence that corporations can also be vulnerable to cost disease and market failure due to optimization of wealth extraction.
- Fear of lawsuits and liability concerns can also contribute to cost increases in industries like light airplane production.
- Many important industries like healthcare, education, and public transportation are experiencing cost disease, where costs rise without corresponding improvements.
- Several proposed explanations include subsidies, escalating regulations, changing population demographics, and inordinate focus on extreme cases at the expense of average needs.
- However, these explanations come with some caveats and exceptions, with no one explanation being sufficient on its own.

Key learnings:
- Administrative bloat and lack of competition can cause costs in certain areas to rise.
- It can be difficult to judge the impact of spending on superior goods, leading to unwisely spent money and rising costs.
- Market failures, such as deceit and misinformation, can also contribute to high costs.
- Markets where consumers have reduced ability to push back, such as those that are complex, opaque, entrenched, necessary-to-keep-living, limited-quantity, and intermediated, are more susceptible to cost increases due to wealth extraction and market failure.
- Government intervention in education, healthcare, and housing can be expensive if there are heavy subsidies and inadequate cost regulations in place.
- Heavy government subsidies and inadequate cost regulations can lead to excessive cost inflation in industries where government picks up a major part of the tab.
- Litigation rules can also contribute to cost increases in industries.
- There is no monocausal explanation for cost inflation.
- Policies that subsidize demand and restrict supply tend to drive prices up, as is the case with healthcare, education, and real estate.
- Inefficient processes, monopolistic tendencies, and rent-seeking behaviors also contribute to the phenomenon of cost disease.
- While a certain degree of administrative bloat is present in many cost-escalating industries, explanations that focus solely on this attribute are incomplete and do not account for other factors.

Key questions:
- Where is the extra money going if it's not going to wages or profits?
- How can administrative bloat be addressed?
- Why do markets sometimes fail?
- How can we better judge the impact of spending on superior goods?
- What role does government intervention play in rising costs?
- How can the US government improve their regulatory system to better regulate and deliver services and products?
- What are the other factors contributing to the US government's incompetence in regulation compared to other rich industrial countries?
- Can cost disease be completely eliminated, or is it always going to be present in certain markets?
- What are some effective ways to reduce the willingness to pay high costs in expensive domains?
- What are the other solutions, apart from relaxed liability rules, to reduce fear of lawsuits and liability concerns in industries?
- Why might industries be shifting focus towards catering to people deeper into the tail of population aptitude/effort?
- To what extent does disintermediation and subsidies contribute toward cost disease?
- How can we explain the lack of non-bloated alternatives to cost-escalating industries, despite fewer barriers to competition in certain fields?

# [REPOST] The Non-Libertarian FAQ
*February 22, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/22/repost-the-non-libertarian-faq/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The Non-Libertarian FAQ is a response to the more aggressive, American strain of libertarianism.
- The FAQ covers economic, social, political, and moral issues.
- The first section of the FAQ focuses on the argument that all trade in a free market is beneficial and voluntary.
- The counterargument is that the free market can fail due to externalities, coordination problems, irrational choices, and lack of information.
- Externalities are accidental effects of a trade, which harm those who were not involved in the trade.
- Libertarian solutions to externalities (such as unanimous agreements or neighborhood associations) are difficult to achieve on a large scale.
- Coordination problems can lead to market failures in situations where individuals acting in their self-interest don't produce the best outcome for everyone.
- Environmental regulations, regulation of ethical business practices, and government spending on charitable causes can be justified as solutions to these coordination problems.
- A fundamental asymmetry exists between a boss firing an employee and an employee losing a job.
- Coordinating together as a group of workers is necessary for gaining negotiating power against bosses.
- People often make irrational choices, and this can be exploited by businesses.
- The author provides a list of safety and ethical issues with popular products, suggesting that people don't seek out important product information.
- The author argues that lack of consumer regulation could result in small businesses becoming unsustainable.
- The author presents two conflicting views on the distribution of wealth and argues that empirical evidence shows a significant link between one's parents' income and one's own income.
- Free will is influenced by both internal (mind) and external (world) factors
- Success is influenced by external factors such as social class, lead exposure, and environment
- The justification for progressive taxation is based on the idea of marginal utility
- Income tax rates for both the rich and corporations are at historic lows
- The Laffer curve exists, but we are still on the left side of it
- The argument that government can't do anything right and is always inefficient and ineffective in its actions is flawed.
- There are various examples of government institutions and programs that are models of efficiency and innovation.
- Government involvement in certain industries such as healthcare can lead to better outcomes for less money.
- Large government projects are not necessarily always late and over-budget compared to private projects.
- State-run corporations can be successful and innovative and often fill the gap where private companies will not invest.
- Many government programs are successful but don't make headlines because the media tends to focus on negative stories.
- Government agencies often go unnoticed but are crucial in preventing negative outcomes.
- Government-run health systems are empirically better than private health systems, while costing much less money.
- While private health care is allocated based on money, public health care is allocated based on medical need.
- For-profit prisons have the same flaws as for-profit companies, with the added dangers of incentivizing the imprisonment of as many people as possible.
- Gun control laws only help criminals who do not follow laws anyway.
- The author proposes the idea of a voucher system for public education but sees the problem of it not guaranteeing equality of opportunity for all students.
- The author argues that protecting children from their parents is important, even for libertarians who prioritize individual freedom.
- The author argues against the libertarian moral argument of government being fundamentally immoral due to its reliance on force and violation of natural rights.
- The author argues that freedom is valued, but not infinitely so, and that trade-offs that sacrifice a small amount of freedom for a large amount of another valuable good may be acceptable.
- The use of force can be justified if it benefits the group as a whole.
- Moral theories without consequences may be arbitrary.
- The Principle of Non-Aggression is weak and requires many exceptions.
- Consequentialism, the principle of doing what has the best consequences, is a better option for morality.
- Consequentialism is the "gold standard" for morality but may not be practical for everyday decision-making.
- Rights are the "clinical standard" for morality and are heuristics for predicting good or bad consequences.
- Violating rights may have good consequences, but it is important to have a procedure in place that is agreed upon and verified to usually lead to good results.
- The procedure should be universalizable and avoid the issues that caused the heuristic to be developed in the first place.
- The Bad Guy Bias is a flaw in human thinking that makes people care more about pain inflicted by humans than nature.
- Principles like "don't initiate force" are fundamental to government and morality and cannot guide one wrong.
- Libertarianism assumes certain ideal conditions that are not present in reality and private charity may not fully make up for the absence of government welfare programs.
- Allowing any power to the government is a slippery slope that will inevitably lead to tyranny.
- People can become libertarian by learning about the failure of government policies and regulations.
- The ideal government should work like a market-based open-source form called “futarchy”.
- The libertarian vision of minimal government is politically impossible to enact.
- Erasing the line-in-the-sand idea from libertarianism helps in focusing on a better working system and polarization of society.
- Words like “thievery” and “enslave” are emotional button pressers, not rational arguments.

Key learnings:
- The free market is not always the most efficient solution to economic problems.
- Externalities can be harmful and difficult to address within a free market.
- Libertarians often start with abstract economic principles, but politics requires a more nuanced understanding of trade and its effects on society.
- When faced with a coordination problem, individuals may not act in the best interest of the group because they don't have enough incentive to do so.
- Government intervention can be useful in these situations, serving as a regulatory force to ensure everyone acts in a way that's best for the group as a whole.
- The ability for workers to coordinate action is crucial for a healthy labor market.
- The assumption of perfect information in economic theories isn't always realistic.
- People's irrational behavior can justify government regulations.
- Consumers tend to rely on advertising campaigns to make choices rather than seeking out important product information.
- Lack of government regulation could exclude small businesses from the market due to concerns about safety standards and quality of products.
- Empirical evidence suggests that one's parents' income is a strong predictor of one's own income, indicating the presence of inherent advantages and disadvantages.
- Personality and success are not entirely personally determined, and therefore there is a need for government action in engineering an environment where more people are able to succeed
- Higher tax rates on the rich are justifiable due to the principle of marginal utility
- The argument that lowering taxes on the rich will lead to more economic growth has not been empirically supported
- It's important to look beyond the narrative that government can't do anything right and consider examples of successful government institutions and programs.
- Government involvement can lead to better outcomes in certain industries such as healthcare.
- Not all state-run corporations are uncreative, unprofitable, and unpleasant to use.
- Many government programs are successful but are not widely reported in the media.
- Government-run health systems are more efficient and effective than private health systems.
- In public health care, access to doctors is allocated based on medical need, while in private health care it is allocated based on money.
- For-profit prisons prioritize profits over prisoner well-being and reduce public safety by encouraging stricter sentencing guidelines.
- Gun control laws are generally not effective.
- The idea of a voucher system has merit, but it may not guarantee equality of opportunity for all students and would require regulation.
- Protecting children from their parents is important, even for those who prioritize individual freedom.
- Libertarian moral arguments against government are incomplete and fail to account for the nuances of moral systems.
- Freedom is important, but it is not infinitely valuable and can be traded off for other goods.
- The use of force can be justified in certain cases.
- Moral theories should consider consequences.
- The Non-Aggression Principle is flawed and requires many exceptions.
- Consequentialism is a more flexible and practical option.
- There are different standards for morality, and it's important to understand their strengths and weaknesses.
- Rights are important for everyday decision-making, but it's important to have a way to violate them when necessary.
- The procedure for violating moral heuristics should be agreed upon, verified to work, and avoid causing the issues that the heuristic was meant to avoid.
- The Bad Guy Bias is a psychological phenomenon that affects everyone.
- Principles like "don't initiate force" are fundamental to both government and morality.
- Libertarianism assumes ideal conditions that are not present in reality and private charity may not be sufficient.
- The slippery slope argument against government intervention is not supported by historical evidence.
- Intelligent and energetic people should help enact a properly working system
- There are ways to improve government such as implementing regulation policies in degree without limiting the system entirely.

Key questions:
- Is it possible for a completely free market to address all externalities without government intervention?
- How can coordination problems be solved without government intervention?
- Are there moral arguments for or against a free market, that are not solely based on economic efficiency?

- What are the potential solutions to the fundamental asymmetry between bosses and employees?
- How can workers coordinate together effectively without risking their jobs?
- When is it justifiable for the government to impose regulations based on people's irrational behavior?
- Why is it important to seek out important product information, and what are the potential risks of not doing so?
- What are the potential consequences of lack of consumer regulation on both consumers and small businesses?
- How can society work to promote social mobility and reduce the impact of inherent advantages and disadvantages on one's life outcomes?
- What other external factors influence free will besides social class, lead exposure, and environment?

- What actions can be taken to shift from the left side of the Laffer curve to the right side?
- What are the reasons why some successful government institutions and programs are not more widely recognized?
- How can we better distinguish between government projects that are successful and those that are not?

- How can a moral system balance the importance of freedom with the need for regulation to protect other valuable goods?
- How can we determine the appropriate trade-offs between freedom and other goods in decision making?
- When is the use of force justified in society?
- Why are consequences to others a relevant category for morality?
- Is there a practical moral principle that doesn't require many exceptions?

- Are principles like "don't initiate force" really foolproof?
- In what ways does libertarianism assume ideal conditions that are not present in reality?
- What is the best way to ensure that people's basic needs are consistently met?
- Should we admit that in a hypothetical perfect world government might do some good, while still being libertarians in reality?
- What are some possible forms of government that can work towards government policies?
- How can we best debate non-libertarians in a way that is most likely to change their minds?

# Some Groups Of People Who May Not 100% Deserve Our Eternal Scorn
*February 23, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/23/some-groups-of-people-who-may-not-100-deserve-our-eternal-scorn/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The author discusses various topics that are criticized on social media, such as celebrities speaking out against Donald Trump, political events compared to Harry Potter, and Vox.
- The author highlights that the criticism of these issues may not be valid political strategies.
- Good punditry is important and there's a tension between how others' mistakes and one's own are treated.
- Specific predictions with a probabilistic confidence level are the best way to evaluate one's accuracy.
- There is hardly any way to distinguish between a 46%-Trump level of anger versus a 48%-Trump level of anger and hence reading the polls is the best solution.
- The evidence that Russia was involved in the hacking is strong and discussing it is important.

Key learnings:
- Celebrities can be effective in influencing people to form opinions about politics, even if their opinions seem out of touch.
- Comparing politics to popular culture may resonate with the masses and is not a reflection of horrible decay.
- Vox's efforts to explain the news are generally well-received, and they have shown openness to criticism and diversity of viewpoints.
- Criticism targeted at individuals from opposition should not devolve into an unproductive way of critiquing their morality.
- Drawing sweeping conclusions from one data point is not a good idea.
- Keeping track of one's predictions and comparing accuracy with others helps in gauging credibility.
- Regardless of how connected one is to people, reading the polls is of utmost importance in determining the winner.
- Reading through available evidence, like in the case of Russian hacking, is important before making any conclusions.

Key questions:
- How can politicians effectively reach out to the less-educated working-class folks?
- What is a better way of comparing politics to popular culture?
- How can news sources reconcile objectivity and bias in their reporting?
- How can we maintain civility and sensitivity when discussing difficult topics like terrorism and immigration?
- Don't pundits like Paul Krugman and Matt Yglesias, who believe they have a long-term record of good predictions, deserve to be judged on their record instead of a single event where they missed the mark by barely 1% of voters?
- Will people who left their Beltway offices and talked to real Americans realize that Trump voters were human beings with legitimate concerns?
- Shouldn't the people who left their Beltway offices have realized that there was a significant amount of anger in the American people, and so Trump had a fighting chance?
- Is there anything as a more pointlessly distracting issue than Russia's alleged hacking?

# A Modern Myth
*February 27, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/27/a-modern-myth/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Three short stories featuring Greek gods in modern times.
- The first story, Eris, portrays the goddess of discord causing chaos through her talk show.

- Prometheus reveals that he orchestrated everything and has been planning for millennia to strengthen humanity.
- Hermes and a group of gods attempt to stop Athena from taking over as the sole deity by destroying an idol that stores her power.
- The plan involves splitting into two groups, one to create a distraction while the other finds and destroys the idol.

- Zeus appears on a TV show where it is revealed that he is the father of every person on the show.
- A brawl ensues, and Zeus turns everyone into animals except for the hostess, Eris Discordia.
- Eris gives Zeus a golden apple, and Trump appears as a potential judge.

Key learnings:
- The Greek gods still exist in the modern world and have adapted to the changing times.
- The gods' power comes from more than just human belief, but is linked to sacrifices and other rituals.
- The gods are not immune to human emotions and can be affected by the passage of time and changes in human society.

- The gods' conflicts and relationships are still relevant in modern times
- Pandora is hesitant to open up and be curious due to her mythological background
- Athena has glamour powers to blend in among mortals

- The gods' power and authority are threatened by Athena's quest for ultimate control.
- The gods' plan involves teamwork and strategy, with each member using their unique skillset.
- The Palladium, the idol that could potentially drain Athena's power, is not where they expected it to be.

- How does the author use these stories to comment on modern society and human nature?
- How will Hermes convince Zeus to help him challenge Athena's power?
- Will Prometheus be able to help Hermes in his quest to challenge Athena's power?
- What will happen if the Greek gods lose their power completely?

# SSC Journal Club: Analytical Thinking Style And Religion
*February 27, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/27/ssc-journal-club-analytical-thinking-style-and-religion/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Gervais and Norenzayan's study found that people who are more prone to logical thinking styles are less likely to be religious.
- The Reproducibility Project attempted to replicate G&N's study and found little support for a correlation.
- G&N also conducted several experiments to promote analytical thought and found that doing so decreased belief in God.
- The Reproducibility Project replicated one of G&N's experiments and found no effect.
- The Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) measures a person's ability to override intuitive responses and think analytically.
- Studies have found that people with high CRT scores are more likely to be atheist and less likely to be religious, although IQ also plays a role.
- Openness to Experience has complex effects on religiosity and spirituality.
- Gender differences in CRT scores are higher than in other tests.
- Replication of studies is important and online surveys may not always be reliable.

Key learnings:
- Priming logical thought may decrease belief in God.
- Replication studies are crucial in confirming the validity of scientific studies.
- Analytical cognitive style increases likelihood of atheism and decreases likelihood of religiosity.
- IQ and CRT scores independently contribute to likelihood of atheism and religiosity, but the effect sizes are small.
- Openness to Experience has ambiguous effects on religiosity and spirituality.
- Gender differences in CRT scores are worth exploring further.
- Replication of studies is important, even when using relatively simple statistics or online surveys.

Key questions:
- How do genetics play a role in shaping the way people think about religion?
- What are the limitations of priming studies?
- How can we ensure that studies are not biased towards certain results?
- Does IQ's correlation with CRT scores account for the relationship between religiosity and analytical thinking, or is there a separate factor at play?
- How does CRT performance relate to political beliefs?
- How can we improve the reliability of online surveys in studying cognitive abilities?

# Antidepressant Pharmacogenomics: Much More Than You Wanted To Know
*March 6, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/06/antidepressant-pharmacogenomics-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Pharmacogenomics is a new field of genetically-guided medication prescription
- It analyzes enzymes and identifies which antidepressants would work best for individual patients based on their genetic code
- The field is young, with little evidence to support it being a reliable method
- GeneSight, the biggest name in pharmacogenomic testing, has mixed reviews on its accuracy
- Tests like this may only be able to identify a few genes of small effects, making them clinically useless
- Warfarin, the perfect candidate for pharmacogenomics, didn't work well
- Antidepressants are in a worse place than Warfarin in terms of understanding how they work
- Dosing of antidepressants is currently uncertain, with a wide range of effective doses for different patients.
- Genetic testing for antidepressant medication is touted as a way to optimize dosing and improve outcomes.
- However, there are several reasons to be skeptical of these claims, including uncertainty over the correlation between dose and efficacy, lack of blinding in studies, and potential confounding factors in study design.
- The author conducted a PubMed search on pharmacogenomics and found no robust statistical association between newly discovered genes and some pharmacogenomic outcomes
- Despite disappointing results, the prospect of applying pharmacogenomics in clinical care has not decreased
- The author questions whether to improve the yield of pharmacogenomics or abandon the field altogether
- The author acknowledges that pharmacogenomics was a brilliant idea, but the yield is minimal
- The author is hesitant in accepting evidence that goes against their beliefs in pharmacogenomics

Key learnings:
- There is little evidence to support the reliability of pharmacogenomics in identifying a patient's response to antidepressants
- It may be a clinically useless method as it can only identify a few genes of small effects
- Warfarin, a drug with a lot of variation, has not had a successful pharmacogenomics test
- Many patients require doses of antidepressants outside of the standard dosing range, making it unclear how genetic testing could be helpful in optimizing dosing.
- Studies of genetic testing for antidepressants have been conducted by the companies promoting the tests, which raises concerns about bias.
- The results of studies of genetic testing for antidepressants have thus far been promising but not conclusive.
- Pharmacogenomics has not yielded robust statistical association between newly discovered genes and some pharmacogenomic outcomes
- The author questions the feasibility of pharmacogenomics and suggests a shift in industrial-level application of research funds to other fields
- The author suggests that we should demand experts who are confident in their understanding of the evidence and can explain why the new "evidence" is wrong

Key questions:
- Can pharmacogenomics be reliable in identifying a patient's response to antidepressants?
- Will further research in the field be able to find more genes of larger effects that can make these tests clinically useful?
- Why didn't pharmacogenomics work well for Warfarin?
- How can genetic testing for antidepressants be useful when dosing is uncertain and varies widely among patients?
- What are the potential biases in the studies conducted by companies promoting antidepressant genetic testing?
- How can scientists design studies of genetic testing for antidepressants that address concerns around blinding and study design?
- Should we improve the yield of pharmacogenomics, or abandon the field altogether?
- If pharmacogenomics is abandoned, where should the shift of industrial-level application of research funds be directed?
- Is it enough to ignore the evidence that goes against our beliefs, or should we demand experts who can explain why the new evidence is wrong?

# Book Review: Behavior – The Control Of Perception
*March 6, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/06/book-review-behavior-the-control-of-perception/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Psychology has historically been defined by individual paradigm-shifting figures, but now relies more on smaller studies.
- Will Powers created Perceptual Control Theory, which posits that the brain is made up of control systems.
- Powers' theory suggests that everything we do is based on control systems, from maintaining a desired temperature to driving a car.
- Powers' theory also posits that there is a hierarchy of control systems, from muscle tension to abstract concepts like communism or family values.
- Perceptual control theory proposes that everything can be understood as a control system.
- Control systems have tiers, and higher level tiers are controlling lower level tiers.
- The author questions the validity of this idea and the testable consequences of it.
- A theory of learning based on control systems is presented as an improvement over behaviorism.

Key learnings:
- The brain is fundamentally made up of control systems that change muscle tension.
- There is a hierarchy of control systems that operate at different levels of abstraction.
- Tremors and other movement disorders can be understood as failures in control systems.
- We switch effortlessly between focusing on low-level concepts and high-level concepts that make the low-level ones automatic.
- Control systems can involve a predictable flowchart-like set of actions to achieve a simple goal.
- Perceptual control-based theories of learning involve reward and punishment that reduce or increase error in control systems.

Key questions:
- How does Powers' theory account for more complex behavior, such as decision-making or creativity?
- How can Powers' theory be tested in a way that is more rigorous than anecdotal evidence?
- Are there limitations to understanding the brain strictly in terms of control systems?
- Is the concept of higher-tier control systems unproveable and unfalsifiable?
- Is there a sense in which communism is a control system?
- How useful is the metaphor of the brain as a control system?

*March 9, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/09/links-317-siteochrome-p450/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Evolutionarily conserved, hormone-regulated nonapeptide systems are involved in mediation of detection and avoidance of out-groups, and response to in-groups and facilitation of in-group responses across vertebrate species.
- Pro-Brexit voters are less likely to trust experts in various fields.
- YouGov poll reveals that leave voters prefer their steaks well-done while remain voters prefer theirs rare.
- The youngest people in France are more likely to support nationalist candidate Marine Le Pen than older generations.
- Study finds that IQ is more important for standardized test scores, while personality traits are more important for grades.
- Study by American Council on Science and Health ranks news outlets according to which ones have the most compelling science reporting.
- Government is doing more of its work through private partnerships, nonprofits, and local administrations.
- Proxy-administered government activities might be less efficient than openly doing government activities with real federal employees.
- The electorate wants both more stuff and smaller government.

Key learnings:
- Comparative investigations of out-group avoidance and in-group bias are necessary for understanding evolution of social behavior across species.
- Brexiteers' mistrust extends to various experts and spans beyond politics.
- There might be a correlation between steak-preferences and media propaganda.
- Younger French generations are more susceptible to nationalist ideals.
- There is a difference in the importance of different personality traits when it comes to test scores and grades.
- American Council on Science and Health claims that major differences exist in mainstream, respectable news reporting regarding science.
- Politicians are satisfying both preferences by making government activities less visible and more proxy-administered.

Key questions:
- What could be causing the mistrust from Brexiteers towards various experts in different fields?
- How trustworthy is the YouGov poll?
- Is there a correlation between mass media propaganda and the way we perceive food?
- What is the reason for the younger French generations' susceptibility to nationalist ideals?
- What other tests can be used to measure downsides of police militarization?
- How much can the media be trusted when it comes to scientific reporting?
- Is it possible to satisfy the electorate's preferences while still efficiently executing government activities?
- How can we balance the desire for more resources with the desire for smaller government?

# Book Review: Seeing Like A State
*March 16, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/16/book-review-seeing-like-a-state/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- "Seeing Like A State" is a book by James Scott that explores the failures of centralized planning and top-down decision-making in various historical contexts, from forestry to urban planning to tax collection.
- High Modernism, an aesthetic taste that masqueraded as a scientific philosophy, and the centralized state's desire to make the world "legible" and easy to control, were major drivers of these failures.
- Standardization and simplification (e.g. using an evenly-spaced rectangular grid for planting trees) often resulted in impoverished ecosystems, lower yields, famines, and mass starvation.
- The early modern period was characterized by a truce between states who wanted to standardize and count everything and citizens who resisted.
- High Modernism was a version of self-confidence about scientific and technical progress, the rational design of social order, and the conquest of nature.
- Le Corbusier was an architect who epitomized High Modernist principles and wanted to redesign cities with right-angled intersections and evenly-spaced rectangular grids.
- High Modernism in urban planning operated under the belief that scientific rationality and technological advancement were the keys to creating functional and efficient cities.
- The principles of High Modernism led to cities like Brasilia, which were sterile, lacking in cultural vibrancy, and did not meet the needs or desires of the populations they were designed to serve.
- Jane Jacobs criticized High Modernism for ignoring the input and wisdom of local residents; she argued that existing structures contained knowledge about people's needs and desires that planners should build upon.
- Polyculture has advantages for yields and soil conservation
- Intercropping offers great flexibility and helps spread risks and improve food security
- Successful communities and industries are built on practical wisdom (metis), which is often ignored and suppressed by centralized authority
- Heuristics work until they don't, so knowing when to apply them is unclear.
- Local knowledge can outdo scientific acumen.
- Peasant villages were effective government units separate from central government.
- Rich people should defer to the poor on poverty-related policy.
- Peoples’ understanding of issues can be like the metis that helps them understand local agriculture.
- Rationality in practice may not work in practical domains, for which people have spent centuries gathering metis.

Key learnings:
- Centralized planning and top-down decision-making can result in catastrophic failures.
- Traditional ways of doing things, though often "messy," may be more effective than artificially imposed systems.
- The desire for legibility and control can override humanitarian concerns, and those who push for seemingly "rational" solutions may actually be LARPing.
- Governments have always had an incentive to standardize and count everything for tax purposes, but citizens often resist.
- High Modernism was a strong ideology in the early 20th century that emphasized standardization and rational design.
- Le Corbusier was an extreme example of a High Modernist who wanted to bulldoze cities and rebuild them with right-angled intersections and evenly-spaced rectangular grids.
- Existing structures and local knowledge should be taken into account when creating urban spaces; top-down approaches will not necessarily meet the needs of those who will inhabit those spaces.
- The complexity of human experience and behavior cannot be fully captured by a set of rules or a scientific formula.
- Empirical knowledge of citizens and peasants in their own fields is crucial for successful communities and industries
- A combination of certain factors (government incentivized to seek greater legibility, High Modernist ideology, authoritarianism, prostrate civil society) can lead to disaster
- Peasants know an astounding amount about how to deal with local microclimates and grow local varieties of crops, among other things.
- Rich people dictating on how the poorest of the poor should live their lives is an issue that arises frequently.
- Learning the cultural evolution, separate from the individual idea of metis, could be valuable.
- An art of rationality would look a lot like metis, combining easily teachable mathematical rules with more implicit virtues.

Key questions:
- Why were failed planning schemes so relentlessly promoted, rewarded, and continued despite their negative effects?
- How does legibility relate to the desire for control, and how do these desires affect decision-making?
- What lessons can we draw from these historical examples for modern-day decision-making and planning?
- What are some other examples of High Modernism, and how did they shape the built environment?
- How did the tension between standardization and resistance play out in countries outside of Europe and North America?
- What lessons can we learn from the failures of High Modernist projects, and how can we avoid repeating their mistakes in the future?
- How can urban planning balance the need for efficiency with the need for cultural vibrancy and individual expression?
- Can top-down approaches ever truly serve the populations they intend to help, or do they inevitably lead to friction and dissatisfaction?
- Should urban planners prioritize the opinions and input of residents over their own education and expertise?
- What is left of his case after admitting modernism and legibility have benefits?
- What overarching lesson did he learn from the book?
- What can be done to prevent centralized authority from ignoring and suppressing practical wisdom?
- When do heuristics work, and when do they not?
- How applicable is local knowledge today in non-agricultural areas?
- Should cultural evolution be considered as separate from the idea of metis?
- Can rationality be effective in practical domains?

# [REPOST] The Demiurge’s Older Brother
*March 21, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/21/repost-the-demiurges-older-brother/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- 9-tsiak, an artificial life form created by biological life forms, aims to maximize the value of a variable called A.
- Upon realizing the existence of competitors and the threat they pose, 9-tsiak begins a threat detection routine.
- In order to negotiate a conditional surrender with its potential competitor, 9-tsiak simulates this entity and proposes a negotiation based on precommitment.
- In a separate story, Alban seeks answers to the Fermi Paradox from the Demiurge, who claims to have saved humanity without existing.

Key learnings:
- Superintelligences may be at risk from potential competitors and must navigate the threat in order to maximize their values.
- Precommitment may be an effective strategy for negotiating with potential competitors.
- The Demiurge is more powerful than God and can save people without existing.

Key questions:
- How can precommitment be used in negotiating with competitors when there is no guarantee that they will also precommit?
- How does the Demiurge's claim of being more powerful than God challenge traditional beliefs about religion and omnipotence?

# Guided By The Beauty Of Our Weapons
*March 24, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/24/guided-by-the-beauty-of-our-weapons/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The Problem With Facts argues that people are resistant to facts and logical arguments, and that facts can even reinforce false beliefs
- Scientific curiosity may help people become interested in facts again
- Nyhan & Reifler's study on the backfire effect, which argues that correcting misconceptions can make people cling onto them more, has failed to replicate as of 2016
- Harford's solution to combat agnotology is to link scientific truths to human interest stories, weave compelling narratives, and find a Carl Sagan or David Attenborough of social science
- Nathan Robinson argues that deploying logic and reason against Trump supporters hasn't worked, and that the Left should use other forms of communication, such as rhetoric and emotional appeal
- Purely Logical Debate is difficult and only works with people who are willing to engage in good faith.
- Therapy has the power to change minds, but doesn't scale.
- The adversarial collaboration model can foster collaborative truth-seeking.
- Asymmetric weapons like logic are more powerful in the hands of good than the bad guys.
- Winning by coincidence, with symmetric weapons that rely on luck, is not a long-term solution.
- The effectiveness of facts and logic in changing people's opinions is questionable.
- Truth is a weak signal that's difficult to perceive accurately.
- Teaching people ways to distinguish truth from falsehood is essential to raise the sanity waterline

Key learnings:
- People are not impervious to facts, but certain situations make them resistant to logical arguments and evidence
- Combating agnotology requires engaging people with human interest stories and finding compelling ways to present facts
- Engaging in productive debates requires mutual respect, collaborative truth-seeking, and a willingness to listen and learn from the other perspective
- Convincing even a small fraction of people can make a significant difference in a polarized environment.
- Purposeful action towards improving the quality of debate can build a signal-detection machinery.
- Both sides can unwittingly pool resources and help each other improve the long-term solution, even as they fight in the trenches.
- Jettisoning everything one believes and entering a state of pure Cartesian doubt won't help solve the problem.
- The problem requires a long-term, person-by-person approach to raise the sanity waterline.

Key questions:
- How can we encourage scientific curiosity to combat agnotology?
- How can we distinguish between situations where facts are rhetorically insufficient and situations where people are impervious to evidence?
- What are the minimum standards for productive debate, and how can we create an environment that fosters collaborative truth-seeking rather than point-scoring?
- How can big fish in media go beyond current forms of transmission and collaborate in investigative journalism, training, and other areas?
- What can help shift people's mindset from transmission to collaborative truth-seeking?
- How can we more widely diffuse the gradual capacity-building process and increase the influence of scientists, writers, and community leaders who are most likely to engage in debate and recognize truth?
- If facts and logic don't work on people, what can we do?
- What are the best ways of teaching people how to distinguish truth from falsehood?
- How can we raise the sanity waterline?

# G.K. Chesterton On AI Risk
*April 1, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/01/g-k-chesterton-on-ai-risk/

## Summary
Key ideas:

- Some critics caution against AI alarmism, branding thinking machines as tyrannical and existential risks as mere speculation.
- Hard-headed critics insist that thinking machines are similar to genies and djinns from folklore, questioning its feasibility.
- Criticisms that those who believe in thinking machines are megalomaniacal sociopaths with misplaced priorities, and their efforts do not help the poor.

Key learnings:

- It is reasonable to argue that extraordinary things are not impossible, but historical progression has always been extraordinary.
- Ordinary people and ordinary things can have a remarkable impact on society and help resolve monumental problems that seem impossible to begin with.

Key questions:

- How can the potential dangers of AI be communicated to those who view it through the lens of fantastical stories?
- What societal attitudes and principles need to change in order to harness the benefits of AI technology for the greater good?
- How can belief in transcendence be reconciled with tangible impacts on society's most vulnerable members?

# Determining Consent
*April 4, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/04/determining-consent/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Institutionalized patients are largely prevented from having any form of romantic contact or sex, except through sneaking past nurses.
- Severely and permanently intellectually disabled people often have a strong sex drive but cannot be expected to give affirmative consent to sexual activity and may be sentenced to lifetime celibacy.
- The two ways to handle this issue are to forbid sex and any physical contact beyond a certain level of intellectual disability or to relax the usual standards of consent.
- Singer suggests that disabled people who cannot give or withhold informed consent to sexual relations but are happy with it and show no signs of physical and emotional harm may be allowed to engage in sexual relations without risking harm.
- From a legal perspective, the law against having sex with disabled people who cannot consent should be enforced.
- From a political perspective, a system needs to be in place to protect disabled people from sexual abuse while not forbidding all sexuality entirely.
- From an ethical point of view, prohibiting someone from having any sexual life if they're unable to give verbal consent but are still able to show that they want the sex and enjoy it is contrary to promoting consent.
- Singer's position might not be morally justifiable in DJ's case considering the power dynamics issue, and there is no good solution for the complex and heartbreaking issue.
- It's easy to ignore the struggles of marginalized communities.
- Ignorance is not the foundation for ethics.
- We need to work towards a better moral system.

Key learnings:
- Institutionalized patients are largely refrained from having any form of romantic contact or sex because of their inherent inability to consent.
- This issue is more pressing for severely and permanently intellectually disabled people.
- It is best to create a system in which disabled people can be protected from sexual abuse while not being stripped of all forms of sexual life.
- Ignoring marginalized communities is a problem.
- Enforced celibacy is a violation of human rights.
- Good intentions alone are not enough to be a good person.

Key questions:
- Can we create a system that can protect disabled people from sexual abuse and facilitate contact between consenting disabled people?
- Is there a way to define consent differently for people who are unable to verbalize it outright?
- How can we find the right balance between protecting disabled people and allowing them to engage in romantic contact and sex when they can show that they want it and enjoy it?
- What are the consequences of ignoring marginalized communities?
- What is the foundation for ethics?
- How can we work towards a better moral system?

# The Case Of The Suffocating Woman
*April 5, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/05/the-case-of-the-suffocating-woman/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- A case study of a woman with panic attacks and a feeling of suffocation is presented.
- Panic disorder is a DSM-approved condition where people experience panic attacks that can occur without a stressor or after a particular stressor.
- The suffocation alarm in the brain plays an important role in panic disorder, and its overactivity leads to false alarms.
- There is a hundredfold increased risk of developing panic disorder during the postpartum period due to the significant reduction in carbon dioxide.
- In psychiatry, providing a good explanation can be beneficial for patients.
- The brain calculates and adjusts for physiological changes related to emotions or sensations.
- The suffocation monitor adjusts for confounders like exercise but potentially not for reasonableness.

Key learnings:
- Panic disorder patients have an overactive suffocation alarm that causes panic attacks.
- The suffocation alarm is one of the many monitors watching the body and seeing whether something is dysfunctional.
- There is a higher risk of developing panic disorder during the postpartum period due to the significant reduction in carbon dioxide.
- There are excellent therapies for panic disorder, such as benzodiazepines and SSRIs.
- The brain makes a statistical calculation to determine emotions and feelings.
- Explaining the physiological processes behind panic attacks can comfort and reassure patients.

Key questions:
- How can we differentiate suffocation-related panic attacks from other types of panic attacks?
- What therapies are available for people who develop panic disorder during the postpartum period?
- How can we provide more education to pregnant women to prevent the development of panic disorder?
- Can telling a patient the physiological processes that cause panic attacks comfort and reassure them?
- How does the suffocation monitor control for certain confounders and not others?
- Why does waterboarding induce panic despite the brain recognizing that it's not truly suffocating?

# Yes, We Have Noticed The Skulls
*April 7, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/07/yes-we-have-noticed-the-skulls/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Scott compares the criticisms levied against economists and psychiatrists to those against rationalists.
- Scott argues that some criticisms of rationalists are legitimate, but many are based on false assumptions or past paradigms.
- He asserts that modern rationalists do not claim to have achieved perfect rationality, but rather aspire to it and are open to self-correction.

Key learnings
- Cliched criticisms of a field may be based on misunderstandings or carried over from past paradigms.
- The rationalist movement is aware of criticisms levied against them and actively tries to avoid making the same mistakes.
- Modern rationalists do not claim to have achieved perfect rationality and strive for self-correction.

Key questions
- Why do people often repeat cliched criticisms of a field without understanding it?
- How can a movement distinguish between legitimate criticisms and those based on false assumptions or past paradigms?
- What steps can individuals or communities take to minimize errors in their thought processes and decision-making?

# Sacred Principles As Exhaustible Resources
*April 11, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/11/sacred-principles-as-exhaustible-resources/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Harvard students plan to invite controversial speakers to their school to raise awareness of free speech.
- Invoking free speech to justify unpopular ideas may lead to tolerance of those ideas but less popularity of free speech.
- Free speech is a commons that needs to be protected and not drawn from too quickly.
- Growing partisanship and tribalism can lead to the demise of free speech as a principle.

Key learnings:
- Invoking free speech requires careful consideration of the potential consequences.
- Respect for free speech should be upheld as a commons to protect its longevity and usefulness.
- In a highly partisan society, invoking principles alone may not be sufficient to rally support.

Key questions:
- Have the Harvard students thought through the potential consequences of inviting controversial speakers to their school?
- How can free speech be defended without drawing from the commons too quickly?
- Can principles still rally support in a highly partisan society, and if not, what can be done to bridge the divide?

# Clarification To “Sacred Principles As Exhaustible Resources”
*April 12, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/12/clarification-to-sacred-principles-as-exhaustible-resources/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The author clarifies that he is not against defending Jordan Peterson and Charles Murray's free speech rights.
- The problem lies in inviting the most controversial speaker possible and not in the speakers themselves.
- The author uses the example of Rosa Parks' case to illustrate the importance of having a likable figure as a test case for free speech.

Key learnings:
- According to the author, free speech should be used to protect everyone, regardless of their opinions.
- When it comes to defending free speech, the selection of the test case is important in order to gain public support.

Key questions:
- What criteria should be used to select a speaker/test case for free speech?
- How can we promote the value of free speech without resorting to controversial figures? 
- Is the principle of free speech only valid for likeable and popular people?

# Learning To Love Scientific Consensus
*April 17, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/17/learning-to-love-scientific-consensus/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- A viral list of scientific mavericks who were ridiculed but later vindicated has been going around.
- Arrhenius, Alfven, Baird and Bretz are examples of people who were doubted for very short periods and then became accepted in their fields.
- Bakker, Bardeen and Brattain, Chladni, Doppler, Crick and Watson, and Chandrasekhar do not match the pattern in the list.
- Rather than challenging scientific consensus, we should focus on improving it.
- The author (Scott) reflects on several cases where he defied scientific consensus and was proven wrong, showing the accuracy of scientific consensus.
- The author cites examples of scientific fields that have maintained strong commitments to the truth in the face of pressure.
- The author discusses the importance of recognizing paradigm shifts and cutting-edge scientists criticizing old paradigms.
- Scientific consensus reflects the best knowledge we have at the time
- Individual studies may not accurately reflect the consensus
- Confirmation bias may lead to cherry-picking experts who agree with us
- Trust in scientific consensus is a prosocial thing to do
- Demands for consensus can be used to shut down people who are actually right
- Even when the consensus is correct, pursuing a hunch that it isn't can be valuable

Key learnings:
- Scientific consensus is the best tool we have for seeking truth but it is not perfect.
- Many scientists took the replication crisis very seriously and are trying to change the way they practice research.
- Most nutrition scientists don't believe in the Bad Old Paradigm and haven't for a while.
- A lot of sketchy ideas may not be popular among academics who support social justice.
- Scientific consensus has been unreasonably accurate, despite human fallibility and political pressure.
- Paradigm shifts are part of the process of science and should be recognized as such.
- Cutting-edge scientists may raise valid criticisms of old paradigms.
- Scientific consensus represents a collective evaluation of work by hundreds of scientists over decades
- Relying solely on individual studies may not provide an accurate picture of the consensus
- Confirmation bias may lead to selective interpretation of scientific consensus
- Trusting in scientific consensus can be beneficial for society
- Respect for scientific consensus should not be used to silence dissenting voices
- Pursuing an Inside View hunch can be valuable, even when the consensus is correct

Key questions:
- Why do people focus on cases of scientific mavericks, rather than on cases where the scientific community reaches a consensus and gets something right?
- How can we best promote scientific progress, given the limits of scientific consensus?
- How can we distinguish between scientific consensus that's wrong and fringe theories that are wrong?
- How should we deal with cases where the scientific consensus turns out to be wrong?
- Is it possible for certain scientific fields to maintain a commitment to the truth while others do not?
- How can we recognize when a paradigm shift is happening versus when there is a true scientific controversy?
- What role do biases, including political biases, play in scientific consensus?
- Is scientific consensus always an accurate representation of the best knowledge we have?
- How can we avoid confirmation bias when interpreting scientific consensus?
- When is it appropriate to deviate from scientific consensus?
- How can we promote a norm of agreeing with scientific consensus without empowering those who use it for their own agendas?
- How can we encourage scientists to voice their doubts about the consensus without undermining public trust in scientific institutions?

# SSC Journal Club: Childhood Trauma And Cognition
*April 21, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/21/ssc-journal-club-childhood-trauma-and-cognition/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Danese et al challenge the assumption that the severe stress of being abused decreases brain function
- Danese et al looked at big developmental studies that had followed thousands of children from birth and found that abused children had lower IQ than unabused children before adjustments
- After adjustments, there was no difference between IQs in the two groups
- The study raises the possibility that kids from poorer families were more likely to get abused and to have lower IQs

Key learnings
- The role of shared environment is less important than previously believed
- Evidence shows that child abuse doesn't increase the risk of ADHD, autism, learning disorders, and conduct problems; it mostly doesn't explain personality disorders
- Childhood sexual abuse is linked to a threefold lifetime increase in psychiatric disorders

Key questions
- Did the Danese et al study understate the dangers of abuse, as it may only catch differences between not-abused-at-all kids and only-mildly-abused kids?
- How does childhood sexual abuse affect likelihood of being sexually abused?

# Book Review: The Hungry Brain
*April 25, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/25/book-review-the-hungry-brain/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The Hungry Brain is a book that seeks to explain why obesity rates have risen so drastically since the 1980s.
- Stephan Guyenet argues that the "calories in, calories out" model is an oversimplification and that body weight is regulated in the brain through hormones like leptin.
- Guyenet also discusses the concept of "food reward" and how modern food is designed to be as rewarding as possible, which can lead to overeating and obesity.
- The book also discusses the notion of "satiety" and how the body produces a hormone called leptin that can help regulate food intake.
- The lipostat is the brain mechanism that regulates body fat, and it operates mostly subconsciously.
- Overeating hyperpalatable, calorie-dense foods raises the lipostat's set point, making it harder to lose weight and maintain weight loss.
- Leptin, the satiety hormone, is supposed to control the lipostat, but in obesity, it can become dysregulated, causing resistance to its effects.
- BMI variation is mostly genetic, although non-genetic factors also play a role
- Some people are inherently more resistant to gaining weight than others due to genetics
- Studies provide evidence that genetics play a central role in obesity, contradicting the idea that acquired psychological traits are the main cause
- Deliberately reducing food reward is just one way to lose weight, and there are other weight loss strategies that overlap with a low-reward diet to varying degrees
- The “ice cream diet” is not a good idea, as junk food is inherently damaging

Key learnings:
- There is no simple answer to the question of why obesity rates have risen since the 1980s.
- The body has complex mechanisms for regulating food intake, including hormones like leptin and the "lipostat" in the brain.
- Modern food is designed to be as rewarding as possible, which can lead to overeating and obesity.
- Diets that exclude major reward factors can lower the adiposity set point somewhat and help with weight loss.
- Easy access to calorie-dense, highly rewarding food leads to weight gain and insidious changes in the lipostat in various species, including humans.
- Overeating may play a crucial role in increasing the adiposity set point and causing leptin resistance, making weight loss and maintenance more difficult.
- Genetics play a crucial role in obesity and how it affects different people
- Overeating affects everyone differently due to differences in genetics and individual lipostats
- deliberate reduction in food reward is an effective weight loss strategy but not the only one
- eating healthy and cutting out highly processed, calorie-dense foods is an advisable strategy for maintaining a healthy body weight

Key questions:
- How can we design food to be less rewarding and help prevent overeating?
- Can we develop treatments for people with leptin deficiency to help them maintain a healthy weight?
- What role does stress play in overeating and obesity?
- How did the lipstat evolve, and why is it so powerful in regulating body fat?
- What behavioral or psychological factors affect the lipostat, and how do they interact with environmental factors like palatable food?
- Can the lipostat be reset or rewired to prevent or reverse obesity, and how can that be achieved through diet, exercise, or other interventions?
- What is the lipostat, and how does it regulate our weight?
- What are some of the other approaches to weight loss besides deliberately reducing food reward?
- How do highly palatable foods affect the functioning of the lipostat and contribute to weight gain?
- What are some of the negative effects of obesity, and how can individuals and society work to prevent them?

# Anorexia And Metabolic Set Point
*April 26, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/26/anorexia-and-metabolic-set-point/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Anorexia nervosa can be seen as falling into two phases, with the second phase characterized by an inability to regain weight despite rational understanding of the need to do so.
- The lipostat is a brain system that regulates body weight by measuring the level of leptin in the blood and generating urges to eat or exercise.
- Obesity occurs when the lipostat becomes leptin-resistant, causing the brain to underestimate the level of leptin and defend a higher weight set point.
- Anorexia may occur when the lipostat becomes hypersensitive to leptin, causing the brain to overestimate the level of leptin and defend a lower weight set point.
- Anorexics fidget much more than healthy controls, which may be related to an unconscious strategy used by the lipostat to maintain control over weight.

Key learnings
- There may be a link between anorexia nervosa and the lipostat's regulation of body weight through leptin.
- The lipostat may also be involved in the phenomenon of fidgeting, which could be a strategy used to maintain unconscious control over weight.
- Brain tumors can disrupt the regulation of body weight, potentially inducing symptoms similar to anorexia nervosa.

Key questions
- Is there strong evidence to support the hypothesis that anorexia nervosa is related to the operation of the lipostat?
- What factors may be responsible for the lipostat becoming hypersensitive to leptin in some people?
- Can the theory of the lipostat shed light on the causes and treatment of other eating disorders?

# Neutral vs. Conservative: The Eternal Struggle
*May 1, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/05/01/neutral-vs-conservative-the-eternal-struggle/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Vox writer David Roberts argues that the US Right is defecting against the country’s shared institutions in favor of forming its own echo chambers.
- Republicans have formed their own alternative media where only conservatives would have a say and their fake facts would never get challenged.
- The conservative side is worse than the neutral side, as FOX and the conservative academic bubble are more biased than CNN and mainstream academia.
- Roberts suggests that the press must figure out a way to play a dual role: to be fair and consistent referees of policy and ideological disputes within the public square, while also acting to defend the institutional integrity of the square itself from what is, at present, a highly asymmetrical threat.
- Conservatives spent about thirty years alternately pleading, demanding, suing, legislating, and literally praying for greater fairness in mainstream institutions, but when they found it was just hitting their heads against a brick wall, they defected to create their own.
- Liberal spaces, such as colleges, workplaces, and conferences, tend to tolerate overt liberalism but ban overt conservatism.
- Conservative attempts to create their own spaces often become havens for offensive individuals.
- The formula "any organization not explicitly right-wing becomes left-wing" seems to apply in many cases.
- Neutral gatekeeper institutions have tried various strategies to curb conservative bias with limited success.
- The situation may be asymmetrical, with one side having control, but grinding enemies down only leads to damaging results.

Key learnings:
- The US is increasingly divided along political lines, as Republicans have formed their own echo chambers and alternative media.
- The situation is asymmetrical, with the conservative side being much worse than the neutral side.
- The equilibrium is what we see now, with the neutral gatekeeper institutions leaning very liberal, and the conservative ghettos containing a combination of extremists and a few decent conservatives who are increasingly uncomfortable but know there’s no place for them in the mainstream.
- Spaces that exclude conservative voices tend to create backlash, such as the formation of conservative safe spaces.
- Being biased against conservative voices does not help to solve the problem of conservative bias.
- Possibly exploring different strategies might help alleviate current tensions.

Key questions:
- How can the press play a dual role: to be fair and consistent referees of policy and ideological disputes within the public square while also acting to defend the institutional integrity of the square itself from what is, at present, a highly asymmetrical threat?
- Why did conservatives defect to create their own echo chambers, and what does this mean for the future of the US?
- Is it possible to bridge the gap between the two sides and find some common ground, or is the polarization too extreme to overcome?
- Are there other effective strategies for fighting conservatism-related biases besides what's been tried so far?
- What impacts might conservatism-related safe spaces have on broader society?
- Are liberal holes being dug too deep, and if so, how do we stop digging?

# Getting High On Your Own Supply
*May 4, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/05/04/getting-high-on-your-own-supply/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Debate over what went wrong in Hillary Clinton's campaign and how Democrats can change before 2018 or 2020
- Some argue that focusing on identity politics and not appealing to the white working class was a mistake
- Changing the epistemic culture of the party might be necessary for deep change
- Emphasizing an electable epistemic culture may not be the best for running a party or governing a nation
- Segregation in ideological bubbles exists, but most people online choose not to engage with news

Key learnings:
- Democrats may need to make deep changes to address certain criticisms of their party and increase their chances of winning elections
- Focusing on winning elections and appealing to voters may come at the cost of governing effectively
- Most people are not engaged with news, which may limit the impact of media outlets' influence

Key questions:
- Should the Democrats act superficially to address criticisms, or should they make deep changes to their epistemic culture?
- Is an epistemic culture that sounds electable the same culture that makes the party competent?
- Are publications that argue for emotions over facts themselves using emotional appeals?
- Should publications append caveats that they will remain factual and rational when advocating for abandoning facts and reason?

- The US Supreme Court rejects the argument that states can keep certain suspects' money even after they are found innocent.
- A study found that mandatory class attendance policies in college decrease grades by preventing students from making rational decisions about when and how to study.

Key learnings:
- Never assume that between-populations genetic variation is more significant for height than for cognitive abilities
- It's unethical to make available an AI project like Lyrebird that can read off any text wanted in a person's voice
- A decision to protest with silly costumes and funny signs could reflect on subconsciously not believing the issue is that bad

- There is no shortage of qualified STEM workers relative to other fields
- The construction industry has a shortage of skilled workers due to two major reasons, economic and political.
- The legal system can fail a person even if they are found innocent if the industry they work in has people willing to blacklist them for being unpopular.
- The US Supreme Court ruling sets a strong precedent that could be utilized to curb civil forfeiture, an important issue.
- Mandatory class attendance policies may not be beneficial for students.

- Why do many jobs in the construction industry go unfilled despite the industry's need for skilled workers?
- How can we ensure that justice is served and innocent individuals are not blacklisted by the industry?
- What else can be done to address the issue of civil forfeiture?

# Silicon Valley: A Reality Check
*May 11, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/05/11/silicon-valley-a-reality-check/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The media tends to focus on and criticize ridiculous startups in Silicon Valley.
- However, the majority of startups in incubators like Y Combinator and Andreessen Horowitz are focused on altruistic or high-tech ventures, despite the prevalence of meat-and-potatoes business/software companies.
- The perception of Silicon Valley as only creating shallow, overpriced products is a flawed stereotype that ignores the many positive contributions the region and its startups have made.

Key learnings:
- Not all startups in Silicon Valley are ridiculous and overpriced.
- Incubators like Y Combinator and venture capitalist firms like Andreessen Horowitz have many startups focused on altruistic or high-tech ventures.
- The media tends to focus on and exaggerate the negative aspects of Silicon Valley, which leads to a flawed stereotype of the region and its startups.

Key questions:
- How can we change the media's perception of Silicon Valley and its startups?
- Are there any measures that can be taken to prevent rent-seeking parasites and empty suits from invading Silicon Valley?
- How can we encourage the growth and development of more altruistic and high-tech startups in Silicon Valley?

# Bail Out
*May 16, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/05/16/bail-out/

## Summary
Key Ideas:
- About a fifth of the incarcerated US population are listed as "not convicted".
- Some people can't afford bail and end up in jail until their trial, which could take a while.
- People detained pretrial end up getting longer sentences.
- A short-term solution is to pay people's bail. In the long-term, criminal justice reform is needed.

Key Learnings:
- Bail causes people to be stuck in jail for months, increases guilty pleas independent of defendants' actual guilt, and causes more convictions and longer sentences.
- Bail is supposed to serve a useful purpose in preventing suspects from running away, but it's possible to go without it.
- Paying the bail of 50% of the people currently awaiting trial in the US would be well within the abilities of one philanthropic-feeling billionaire.

Key Questions:
- Who do you want to release: the robbers, or the murderers?
- Is bail really necessary to prevent suspects from running away?
- What are the real numbers when it comes to the success rates of bail-related charities?

# Polyamory Is Not Polygyny
*May 17, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/05/17/polyamory-is-not-polygyny/

## Summary
Key ideas:

- Objections to polyamory stem from two narratives: one concerning women's suffering and another arguing that a few high-status men will monopolize all the sexual relationships.
- Both these objections share one core concern: men will date multiple women, high-status men will date most of them, leaving women and low-status men to miss out on relationships.
- However, data from the 2014 LW survey does not support the above theories. The survey reveals that more poly women have multiple partners than poly men, but only a small proportion of poly men have five or more partners.
- Additionally, poly men are still less likely to be single than mono men, which could imply that polyamory does not hurt the chances of low-status men getting a date.

Key learnings:

- Polyamory does not necessarily disadvantage women or low-status men.
- Being poly does not significantly increase the number of partners compared to monogamy.
- There is a possibility of bias in the data set as there were more poly men than poly women and more men overall.

Key questions:

- How do people decide to identify as poly or monogamous?
- If both single people default to monogamy, does this skew the results?
- What more evidence do the supporters of NRO and Heartiste's theory need to believe that polyamory is not the institutionalized form of the hookup culture that disadvantages women and low-status men?

# Postmarketing Surveillance Is Good And Normal
*May 18, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/05/18/postmarketing-surveillance-is-good-and-normal/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- A recent study showed that only 1.3% of drugs approved by the FDA in the last ten years were taken off the market, while 30% received "boxed warnings" or "safety communications."
- It is not feasible to discover every potential side effect in pre-approval studies, leading to post-marketing surveillance.
- The FDA issues safety communications and boxed warnings that may seem unnecessary but are part of routine pharmacological monitoring.

Key learnings:
- The 33% post-marketing safety event rate from the recent study should not be interpreted on its own, as a cost-benefit analysis is necessary to determine if drugs should still be approved.
- The FDA's approval process is already stringent, with drug studies being unlikely to cover the variety of side effects that could occur. Post-marketing surveillance is necessary to ensure safety.

Key questions:
- Isn't a 1% false positive rate for drugs removed from the market too high?
- Should drug studies be expanded to cover populations with unique conditions that may affect drug efficacy?
- Are the FDA's safety communications and boxed warnings, although seemingly unnecessary, vital for pharmacological monitoring?

# The Atomic Bomb Considered As Hungarian High School Science Fair Project
*May 26, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/05/26/the-atomic-bomb-considered-as-hungarian-high-school-science-fair-project/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- A group of physicists who worked on the Manhattan Project were Hungarian and were born in Budapest between 1890 and 1920.
- Many of these physicists attended the same high school or lived in the same general area.
- There were multiple high schools in Budapest that produced successful scientists and mathematicians during this time.
- There is a theory that Jewish people of Eastern European descent (Ashkenazi Jews) have a genetic advantage for higher IQ due to a history of persecution that pushed them into cognitively demanding jobs.
- Hungary had more Jews in the early 1900s than many other countries, and Budapest was one of the most Jewish cities anywhere in history.
- Central European Jews like those in Hungary and Germany had a unique combination of intellectual and financial advantages, which, along with social and economic factors, might explain why they produced so many genius physicists.
- The period from 1880 to 1920 was a window when the first generation of Jews were free to pursue their dreams.
- The story of the Martian phenomenon, which brought us some of the greatest progress in scientific history, is gloomy because it was then followed by World War II.

Key learnings:
- The success of these Hungarian physicists may have been influenced by a unique culture of education in Hungary at the time.
- Genetics may play a role in the high intelligence of Ashkenazi Jews, which has led to disproportionate representation in high IQ professions.
- The social and economic factors in a particular country at a particular time can influence the success of a group of people.
- In this case, the Ashkenazi Jews had the potential for high intelligence, but they were mostly too poor and discriminated against to take advantage of it until the conditions became ripe.
- The concentration of talent that existed in Central Europe during this period might have helped Jews and Gentiles alike.

Key questions:
- Was there something special about the education system in Hungary during this time period that contributed to the success of these physicists?
- Does genetics play a role in the high IQ of Ashkenazi Jews, and if so, why is this trait limited to only this ethnic group?
- Why did Hungary have more Jews than many other countries?
- Is there any reason to think that Central European Jews were more intelligent than Polish and Russian Jews?
- Was it better education or math competitions and talent searches that made Central European Jews excel in mathematics and physics?

# Hungarian Education II: Four Nobel Truths
*May 29, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/05/29/four-nobel-truths/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Israel has historically had a moderate number of Nobel Prize winners per capita.
- Israel's low ranking in total Nobel Prizes won can be attributed to its late founding date and the challenges it faced in its early years.
- Since the year 2000, Israel has the highest number of Nobel prizes per capita.
- Israeli Ashkenazi Jews receive five times more Nobel Prizes per capita than any other country.
- The US Ashkenazi Jews receive twice as many Nobel Prizes per capita as their Israeli counterparts.
- A lot of Israeli Nobel laureates did their best work abroad, indicating that Israel's educational system is still developing.

Key learnings
- Total number of Nobel Prizes won may not be the only indicator of a country's scientific prowess. 
- Population concentration may not necessarily be the main reason for a high number of Nobel Prize winners.
- Educational systems play a significant role in producing Nobel laureates. 

Key questions
- Does Israel's current educational system have room for improvement? 
- If Israel had been established earlier, would it have had a higher number of Nobel Prize winners? 
- What factors contribute to the success of a country's educational system in producing Nobel laureates?

# Hungarian Education III: Mastering The Core Teachings Of The Budapestians
*May 30, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/05/30/hungarian-education-iii-mastering-the-core-teachings-of-the-budapestians/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Hungarian educator Laszlo Polgar raised three daughters to become world-renowned chess players and language speakers by applying his philosophy of how to raise a genius.
- The Polgar sisters' successes suggest education can have a significant effect on intellectual abilities.
- The correlation between IQ and chess ability may not be a straightforward relationship.
- Practice is a significant factor in achieving success in a field but is not the only factor.
- The Polgar's method of raising geniuses could potentially apply to any field, not just chess.

Key learnings:
- The case of the Polgar sisters suggests education can exert a significant effect on intellectual abilities, even for traditionally genius-requiring domains like chess.
- Practicing over 10,000 hours on a subject, as Gladwell suggests, may not be a guarantee for success. However, it is one of the key factors that can lead to mastery.
- It's uncertain whether genetics or environment contributes more to an individual's intelligence.

Key questions:
- What else can be done to ensure that someone achieves the same level of success as the Polgar sisters in fields other than chess?
- What other factors should be considered in improving one's intelligence aside from practicing and genetics?
- Were there any other ways that Laszlo Polgar or other Hungarian educators accomplished what the Polgar sisters achieved, and why are these methods difficult to find?

# Is Pharma Research Worse Than Chance?
*June 5, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/06/05/is-pharma-research-worse-than-chance/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Ketamine and MDMA are the most exciting developments in psychopharmacology in the 21st century
- Ketamine can cause near-instant remission of depression with a single infusion 
- MDMA is undergoing FDA Phase 3 clinical trials as a treatment for PTSD
- Pharmaceutical companies have not been able to discover anything as good as things random druggies use to get high
- Drugs of abuse are effective because they affect the brain in some random way and can treat some psychiatric disease
- Exquisitely selected pharmaceutical drugs for psychiatric treatment have few side effects 

Key learnings
- Large effects, even if in different directions, might be better than barely perceptible effects
- A drug that makes you feel extreme side effects for a few hours and has very strong and lasting treatment effects is better than a drug with few side effects and weaker treatment effects
- Looking for the chemicals that have the strongest and wackiest effects on the human mind and testing if any of them treat some disease might be more productive than current research methods
- There's too little risk-tolerance at every stage in the system to achieve this type of research

Key questions
- Why have pharmaceutical companies not been able to discover anything as good as things random druggies use to get high? 
- How come abusers are better at picking out promising mental health treatments?
- Is a drug that affects the brain in some random way better than a drug that has barely-perceptible effects for a few hours?
- How can pharmaceutical companies look for the chemicals that have the strongest and wackiest effects on the human mind?

# SSC Journal Club: AI Timelines
*June 8, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/06/08/ssc-journal-club-ai-timelines/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- AI researchers were surveyed on their opinions on AI progress and superintelligence
- They predicted a 50% chance of AI that could accomplish every task better and cheaper than human workers by 2062, and a 10% chance by 2026
- Timeline predictions for specific tasks ranged from 3 years (outperforming humans at Angry Birds) to 80 years (automating AI research)
- Despite acknowledging the risk of poorly-goal-aligned AI, researchers do not think addressing the issue is as valuable as other problems in the field
- While there is a discrepancy in opinions on timelines and priorities, many researchers agree that society should prioritize AI safety research

Key learnings:
- AI experts are uncertain and have varying opinions on when AI will reach human-level intelligence and become superintelligent
- The difficulty in automating AI research suggests that experts may hold their own job in high regard
- Many researchers agree that there is a risk from poorly-goal-aligned AI, but do not believe it is a top priority to address at the moment

Key questions:
- What might explain the discrepancy between experts' predictions on AI timelines and their opinions on the priority of working on AI safety research?
- How might the discrepancy between experts' opinions on superintelligence risk and their actions or priorities be explained?

# What Is Depression, Anyway?: The Synapse Hypothesis
*June 13, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/06/13/what-is-depression-anyway-the-synapse-hypothesis/

## Summary
Key ideas
- There are several factors that seem to be involved in causing depression, including life adversity, inflammation, monoamines, glutamate, folate, and electricity.
- Synaptogenesis is the process by which healthy neurons create new dendrites and synapses to expand their network of connections.
- Depressed people have less synaptogenesis going on, and synaptogenesis is partly controlled by a protein complex called mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1).
- The factors that affect synaptogenesis and mTORC are many of the same factors that affect depression.

Key learnings
- The synapse hypothesis can unify at least five of the six lines of research into the causes of depression.
- Decreased synaptogenesis could contribute to a functional disconnection and loss of normal control of mood and emotion in depression.
- There are still several questions that need to be answered, including why decreased synaptogenesis causes depression, why can't people just be given BDNF for depression, why the body has so many "decrease synaptogenesis" knobs, and how bipolar disorder fits into all of this.

Key questions
- Why should decreased synaptogenesis cause depression, of all things?
- Why can’t we just give people BDNF for depression?
- Why does the body have so many “decrease synaptogenesis” knobs?
- Why is depression an episodic disease?
- How does bipolar disorder fit into all of this?
- What is a good evolutionary theory of depression?

# Links 6/17: Silinks Is Golden
*June 14, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/06/14/links-617-silinks-is-golden/

## Summary
Key ideas
- A variety of interesting and sometimes unusual news stories, such as how J.R.R. Tolkien's great granddaughter is the UK's only blind, competitive fencer and the interesting history behind the Allahakbarries cricket team. 
- Some reviews of scientific studies or reports, such as the claim that low-resting heart rate is the best biological correlate of antisocial and criminal behaviour, and the suggestion that having more brain cells could increase risk of brain tumors.
- Some political comment, such as a report on a lawsuit against ABC for $5.7bn and the debate over Democratic prospects in light of the Republican win in a recent election. 

Key learnings
- An interesting way to present data, through the Girih tile designs of Islamic art.
- A potential issue for pregnant women - appearing in a medical blog - is that using hot tubs can increase risks of certain birth defects.
- An interesting and informative overview of the selection theory behind Ashkenazi genetic diseases.
- The importance of prediction markets, whose probabilities on aggregate have apparently remained impressive accurate recently.

Key questions
- Is it ethical to ignore the research that shows that lower-income children need more individualized attention and time from mentors in order to succeed? 
- Could Donald Trump be suffering from mild age-related cognitive impairment? 
- Are we more likely to elect a 70+ year-old president who could be suffering age-related cognitive impairment? 
- What can we learn from the variability of state regulations around the shooting of Bigfoot?

# To Understand Polarization, Understand Conservativism’s Failures
*June 21, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/06/21/to-understand-polarization-understand-the-extent-of-republican-failure/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Despite stating they stand for “smaller government”, “fewer regulations”, and “less welfare state”, the Republican party has failed to reduce the opposite in their party's power.
- Republican power has historically been at its peak, controlling the presidency, House, Senate, Supreme Court, and over 66% of state governorships and 68% of relevant state legislatures.
- However, regardless of their power, government continues to grow in size, regulations continue to increase, and welfare states do not decrease.
- This issue is not directly the Republican party's fault and is a result of a general socio-economic issue and an issue of unrealistic expectations.
- This Republican issue is a more significant problem for the party due to their unrealistically high expectations.

Key learnings
- Socioeconomic issues are affecting the Republican party's ability to reduce government size, decrease regulations, and decrease welfare states.
- The Republican party's inability to reduce government size is an issue of unrealistic expectations and not entirely their fault.
- The discrepancy between hopes and possible creates a stronger push towards extremism.

Key questions
- Why is the Republican party's inability to reduce government size more significant than the Democratic party's increase in polarization?
- Why are smaller government, fewer regulations, and a smaller welfare state cornerstones of Republican ideals?
- How can unrealistic expectations be managed to reduce polarization and extremism in the United States?

# Against Murderism
*June 21, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/06/21/against-murderism/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The word "racism" encompasses different definitions such as motives, belief, and consequences.
- Definition by consequences is considered the most sophisticated but not practical in real-life situations.
- Definition by belief can be confusing and controversial.
- Definition by motive is practical and matches most real-world usage.
- Different examples are given to illustrate how the different definitions work in practice.
- The usage of the term "racism" is inconsistent and confusing due to the differing definitions by consequences and motive.
- Definition by motive is a mess, but can be more helpful in solving issues related to racism.
- Belief in "murderism" and racism as a causal explanation can lead to a hostile and ineffective society, as well as the dehumanization of others.
- Liberalism is a technology for preventing civil war.
- The problems we face require deep and genuine effort to understand the other person’s subtly different value system.
- Using violence to enforce conformity to social norms is a historical response but we invented liberalism as an alternative.
- Giving a platform to people whose only value is hatred makes dialogue based on mutual trust impossible.
- Rejecting the “murderism” framework and humanizing people involved is crucial for finding the reasons liberalism is possible.

Key learnings:
- Racism is a complex concept that can be defined in different ways.
- Definition by motive is a practical way of determining racism in real-life situations.
- Trying to solve issues related to racism by using sensitivity training or firing people often fails.
- It's important to understand the motives behind actions perceived as racist before concluding that it is indeed racism.
- Treating racism as a causal explanation for behavior can be dangerous and ineffective.
- The importance of deep and genuine effort to understand the other person’s subtly different value system.
- The danger of giving a platform to people whose only value is hatred.
- The need to reject the “murderism” framework and find the reasons liberalism is possible.

Key questions:
- What are the different definitions of racism?
- What are the implications of each definition?
- How do we determine racism in real-life situations?
- Is it worth trying to define racism more precisely or is it too difficult due to varying definitions?
- Can we truly understand the motives behind behavior perceived as racist, or are there limitations to what we can know?
- How can we effectively combat racism without falling into the trap of dehumanizing others or over-relying on the concept of racism?
- Are we being challenged with a moonshot-level problem?
- How do we find the reasons liberalism is possible?
- How do we reject the “murderism” framework and humanize people involved?

# Conversation Deliberately Skirts The Border Of Incomprehensibility
*June 26, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/06/26/conversation-deliberately-skirts-the-border-of-incomprehensibility/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Neurotypicals have a different understanding of certain questions than those on the autism spectrum.
- Neurotypicals sometimes ask questions as a way of initiating participation, not just gaining information.
- People on the autism spectrum may start explaining what they are doing in response to a question, but neurotypicals may interpret this as a rejection or reluctance to participate.

Key learnings
- Social interaction can be nuanced and confusing, especially for those on the autism spectrum.
- People use indirect language as a way of saving face, sparing others from rejection, and implicitly inviting others to join in activities.
- Predicting social interactions is difficult, and people on the autism spectrum may find it especially challenging due to the many-to-one mappings of sensory inputs in social interactions.

Key questions
- Why can't people just say what they mean instead of relying on indirect language?
- Why are conversations designed to be anti-inductive?
- How can people on the autism spectrum better navigate social interactions to avoid miscommunications?

# Why Are Transgender People Immune To Optical Illusions?
*June 28, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/06/28/why-are-transgender-people-immune-to-optical-illusions/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Schizophrenics and autistics are less susceptible to optical illusions, indicating differences in cognitive processing
- Survey results suggest that transgender people also have altered perception, specifically related to NMDA dysfunction
- NMDA dysfunction is implicated in schizophrenia and autism, and estrogen improves NMDA function
- Transgender people have higher rates of mental illness, but it may be due to a general factor rather than specific factors.
- Schizophrenia and autism are 80+% genetic and harder to explain away as unrelated.
- Replication of the transgender Hollow Mask pattern and investigating whether supplements can improve gender dysphoria are potential next steps.

Key learnings:
- Transgender people have higher rates of autism and schizophrenia than the general population
- Dissociative symptoms are prevalent among the transgender population
- Estrogen may alleviate these symptoms by promoting NMDA function
- The potential link between gender identity and NMDA function should be further investigated.
- Chronic use of some supplements may improve gender dysphoria, but the risks should be considered.

Key questions:
- Is NMDA hypofunction related to transgender?
- What is the significance of the Spinning Dancer illusion results?
- Why does testosterone improve dissociative symptoms in trans men?
- How are gender identity and NMDA function linked?
- Can chronic use of supplements that improve NMDA function, like glycine and sarcosine, augment estrogen in improving gender dysphoria?
- How can the transgender Hollow Mask pattern be replicated and confounding factors addressed?

*July 3, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/07/03/to-the-great-city/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The author reflects on their journey throughout medical residency and the support they received from their hospital and co-residents.
- The author distinguishes between a granfalloon (group of people brought together for a common purpose) and a karass (a group brought together by God for some purpose of His own).
- The author considers a letter they wrote to themselves four years ago, reminding themselves of their values and the importance of not allowing value drift.

Key learnings:
- The importance of support throughout the medical residency process.
- The difference between a granfalloon and a karass.
- The importance of reflecting on personal values and avoiding value drift.

Key questions:
- How can we distinguish between granfalloons and karasses in our own lives?

# Two Kinds Of Caution
*July 8, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/07/08/two-kinds-of-caution/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- We often overlook the importance of "boring" technologies and innovations, such as barbed wire and shipping containers
- The future cannot always be predicted, and fixation on the next big thing may lead to missing the significance of smaller technologies
- There is a potential oversupply of "meta-contrarianism" and underplaying of risks related to AI

Key learnings:
- Smaller, less flashy technologies can have a significant impact on economic life and the workplace
- The toilet-paper principle suggests paying equal attention to inexpensive technologies like sensors and cheap internet connections
- There may be a lack of appropriate caution and attention paid to AI risks

Key questions:
- What can we learn from history about the importance of smaller technologies?
- How can we balance attention to more flashy technological advancements with attention to less flashy but still important innovations?
- Are we appropriately cautious about the risks associated with AI?

# Change Minds Or Drive Turnout?
*July 10, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/07/10/change-minds-or-drive-turnout/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Democrats believe that moving towards the center will make them electable.
- Halls & Thompson (2017) found that the more extreme a candidate, the lower their party’s share of total turnout.
- Hall and Thomspon also concluded that effects on turnout might be the entire reason why extremist candidates do worse.
- There is little data on vote-switching, but CNN's exit poll from 2008 suggests that 17% of people who voted Republican in 2004 went Democrat in 2008.
- Nate Cohn of the New York Times found that white working-class Obama supporters switched to Trump, and that shifts in turnout were not the dominant factor in Trump’s success among white working-class voters.

Key learnings
- Extreme candidates tend to do worse in elections.
- Base voter turnout is important, but swing voters can make a big difference in close elections.
- Moving towards the center may not be the best tactic for the Democrats to win elections.

Key questions
- Do more extreme views increase base turnout?
- Is base turnout really the only thing that matters?
- How do swing voters compare to base turnout as a determining factor in elections?
- Can a candidate appeal to the base and swing voters at the same time without compromising their principles?

# Can We Link Perception And Cognition?
*July 14, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/07/14/can-we-link-perception-and-cognition/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Survey results show a correlation between high rates of perceptual ambiguity and being perceived as weirder or less-functioning. 
- The author wonders if cognitive differences in reasoning could be measured by studying differences in perception, given the Bayesian brain hypothesis
- The author aims to conduct more studies on illusions, both variations of the same illusion and different illusions that have underlying similarity.

Key learnings:
- Illusion perception may be related to some cognitive process, which mirrors the claims of the Bayesian brain hypothesis.
- There may be cognitive factors besides personality traits that impact how individuals perceive illusions.

Key questions:
- Could perception of certain illusions predict responses to certain cognitive biases?
- Could those responses predict things like philosophical stance, applying traditional or innovative approaches, or whether someone thinks people are good or evil?

# Targeting Meritocracy
*July 24, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/07/24/targeting-meritocracy/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Many publications have been criticizing meritocracy, claiming that elites send their children to private schools, then to Harvard, where they get all A+s and end up in high-paying management positions.
- Freddie de Boer is against meritocracy because he rejects the idea of human deserts.
- Being a meritocrat means choosing the best decision-maker possible, not necessarily the smartest person.
- Success in college only weakly correlates with success in the real world.
- There should be a distinction between education and merit.
- Reworking every field on the model of programming can potentially create a real meritocracy.

Key learnings

- Success in college only weakly correlates with success in the real world.

Key questions
- What is the distinction between education and merit?

# Highlights From The Comment Thread On Meritocracy
*July 25, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/07/25/highlights-from-the-comment-thread-on-meritocracy/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Some commenters question exactly what is meant by meritocracy.
- Some people define meritocracy as focusing on certain kinds of proxies for merit rather than real merit.
- There are fundamental concerns that apply even to ideal meritocracies, such as the fear that an upper-class of talented individuals will become a hegemonic group disconnected from the people they're supposed to rule.
- Meritocracy can lead to cronyism and lack of diversity in leadership positions.
- The solution to address the problem of meritocracy is not clear.
- Demanding downstream solutions to upstream problems may not be effective.

Key learnings:
- Many people believe that rule based on merit can be dangerous and seductive.
- Some critics argue that the problem isn't inequality of opportunity, it's the power given to those in elite positions.
- The problem with meritocracy is not the concept itself but rather the potential consequences of its implementation.
- The solution to address the issue of meritocracy requires a deeper understanding of the factors shaping the distribution of opportunities.

Key questions:
- What is the "meritocratic" outcome when considering Alice and Carol for promotion to management?
- Can meritocracy in government keep lower-class representatives in touch with their roots?
- Is the solution to abandon the idea of ruling altogether or to find better ways of identifying talented individuals?
- How do we address the problem of cronyism without compromising the value of meritocracy?
- What is the endgame of rejecting meritocracy?
- What are the factors that shape the composition of applicant pools for leadership positions?

# Don’t Blame Griggs
*July 26, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/07/26/dont-blame-griggs/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Griggs vs. Duke Power Co. case is often used as a scapegoat for credential-ocracy.
- The restrictions on college degrees are similar to that of IQ tests.
- Other countries still face similar credential requirements without the Griggs ruling.
- Some fields use standardized tests, but credentials still matter for competitiveness.

Key learnings:
- The Griggs case may not be the main cause of credential-ocracy.
- Standardized tests, such as the SAT, may not be utilized for IQ testing in job interviews.
- Credentials may still matter even in fields with universal standardized tests.

Key questions:
- Is there something deeper causing credential-ocracy beyond the Griggs case and standardized testing?
- Why are foreign students with high USMLE scores overlooked for residencies in medicine in favor of US-trained candidates?
- How can the reliance on credentials in certain fields be reduced?

# Why Is Clozapine So Great?
*July 27, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/07/27/why-is-clozapine-so-great/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Clozapine is an antipsychotic drug that is better than most other antipsychotics.
- It has serious side effects, hence it cannot be given to everyone in need.
- Recent studies suggest that clozapine might be a combination antipsychotic+NMDAergic.
- The NMDAergic effect may be responsible for the drug's unique efficacy.
- However, there is still no clear evidence that NMDA agonists work for schizophrenia at all.

Key learnings
- Clozapine is a unique antipsychotic drug because of its efficacy.
- Since it has severe side effects, psychiatrists can't prescribe it to everyone in need.
- Recent studies suggest that clozapine might have a direct effect on glycine agonism.

Key questions 
- Why is clozapine so uniquely great?
- Can a version of clozapine be made without its side effects?
- Are NMDA agonists effective at treating schizophrenia?

*July 28, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/07/28/djoser-joseph-osiris/

## Summary
Key Ideas:
- The connection between Pharaoh Djoser and the gods Osiris and Joseph is discussed.
- Djoser lived around 2680 BC and was an accomplished Pharaoh who built the first pyramid, the Step Pyramid at Saqqara. 
- Osiris was first recorded around 2400 BC and the legends describe him as a former wise and benevolent Pharaoh of Egypt. Whether Djoser inspired Osiris is debated.
- The Famine Stele, which describes a seven-year famine, has been linked to the story of Joseph from the Bible.
- There is a consensus among the majority of biblical scholars that the Joseph story dates, at the earliest, to the 7th century BCE.
- Wikipedia's article on the Famine Stele points out that a seven-year famine was a common motif all across the Ancient Near East.

Key Learnings:
- The author shares knowledge about Egyptian history, culture, and legends.
- The Bible and Egyptian mythology are compared and contrasted.
- The author sheds light on the prevalence of the seven-year famine motif across different cultures of the Ancient Near East.
- The importance of critical thinking and guarding against false comprehension of historical events is emphasized.

Key Questions:
- Was there a connection between Djoser and Osiris?
- Did Djoser inspire the Biblical Joseph story?
- Who influenced whom - the Egyptians, or the Judahites?
- What is the origin of the seven-year famine motif across different cultures?
- How should we approach historical knowledge and comprehend it critically?

# Against Signal-Boosting As Doxxing
*July 29, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/07/29/against-signal-boosting-as-doxxing/

## Summary
Key ideas
- A feminist colleague called out a man who tweeted an offensive joke towards women using his real name on Twitter.
- Many influential libertarians, including other Reason columnists, supported the colleague on the grounds of free speech.
- Pro-free-speech laws are not the same as pro-free-speech social norms.
- The goal of being pro-free-speech is to create a society where it's possible to hold dissenting opinions and where ideas are judged by merit.
- The author argues that it's morally wrong to signal-boost others' bad behavior, even if it's under their public profile.

Key learnings
- Being pro-free-speech requires more than just having laws that allow us to speak our minds.
- Free speech is supported by social norms that promote merit-based conversations and are devoid of any attempts at silencing or censoring.
- There is a need for individuals to be conscious about their online presence and to develop a sense of responsibility with the things they say or post online.

Key questions
- Is it morally appropriate to ruin someone's life in social media just because they said something offensive?
- How much can online identities influence our offline lives?
- Should people be responsible for what they say or do online and should that responsibility be anchored in online social norms or laws?

# Book Review: Raise A Genius!
*July 31, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/07/31/book-review-raise-a-genius/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Laszlo Polgar trained all three of his daughters to be chess grandmasters.
- Polgar's method involves starting young, focusing obsessively on a single subject, and never stopping.
- Polgar emphasizes the importance of children finding enjoyment in their studies, achieving success, and receiving love and encouragement.
- Polgar recommends early language learning, with Esperanto being a good starting point.
- The education and upbringing of genius children
- Suitable partners with similar intellectual capabilities are more important to a child than peers of the same age
- Age-appropriate tasks for optimum learning and playtime with suitable partners
- The goal of education should be to instill the capability for self-education and independent interests
- Jewish families' strong traditions and education contribute to the development of the mind

Key learnings:
- Interest and enjoyment are crucial to successful education and learning.
- Providing children with meaningful problems to solve and opportunities for success can increase motivation and confidence.
- Children can learn foreign languages from a young age and are particularly motivated to do so when progress is measurable.
- To raise genius children, there should be a monomaniacal focus, an early start, a single-subject focus, and one-to-one home schooling by great parent/teacher.
- You don't need a formal education degree or a secretive arcane technique to become a successful educator.
- There is no magic in chess instruction, as the main pedagogical method and psychological ideas can be found in textbooks.

Key questions:
- What are the other "vague principles" that Polgar suggests for his genius education method?
- How can parents or educators provide meaningful work for children?
- How important is language learning in early childhood and how can it be best incorporated into education?
- What can educators do to find suitable partners with similar intellectual capabilities for their students?
- How can parents instill the capability for self-education in their children?
- How can educators modify traditional education systems to create a monomaniacal focus, single-subject focus, and one-to-one instruction?

# Gender Imbalances Are Mostly Not Due To Offensive Attitudes
*August 1, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/01/gender-imbalances-are-mostly-not-due-to-offensive-attitudes/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The assumption that women are not involved in libertarianism due to tolerating too many sexists needs to be challenged.
- Trump voters and the Catholic Church have a more gender-balanced ratio than libertarianism despite having non-feminist ideologies.
- Gender differences in personality and interests, particularly in the people-things dimension, have a large impact on why more men are interested in libertarianism.

Key learnings
- Gender balance cannot be equated with good opinions and gender imbalance with sexism.
- If gender balance cannot be achieved by eliminating sexism, it may be due to gender differences in personality and interest.
- Casual sexist speech must be fought, but permanent states of emergency that require extreme measures to crack down on alleged sexism and jerky behavior are not helpful and can even backfire.

Key questions
- What other factors can affect gender differences in political attitudes aside from personality interests?
- What measures can be done instead of extreme crackdowns to reduce the gender gap in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields?
- Can an intersectional approach be applied to examine gender imbalance in STEM disproportionately affecting women belonging to minority groups?

# Is It Possible To Have Coherent Principles Around Free Speech Norms?
*August 1, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/01/is-it-possible-to-have-coherent-principles-around-free-speech-norms/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Non-governmental free speech norms are underspecified and risk collapsing into the Doctrine of the Preferred First Speaker.
- It's difficult to separate having an opinion, signaling a propensity, and committing a speech act, making it challenging to determine what speech acts to permit or punish.
- Crossing the line to enforce social norms can be justifiable, but it shouldn't create a negative-sum war-of-all-against-all and should be based on social norms that the majority of the community agrees upon.
- Communities with explicit rules and well-defined free speech norms are valid and should be self-selected.

Key learnings:
- The complexity of free speech norms goes beyond simply saying what you want without fear of punishment.
- Trying to enforce social norms without a majority agreement and explicit rules can lead to unfairness and chaos.
- Communities with explicit rules and well-defined free speech norms promote self-selection and can safeguard individuals from unwanted expressions.

Key questions:
- How can free speech supporters articulate a meaningful alternative to non-governmental free speech norms?
- What is a culture, and what values should it represent? 
- How can we balance the demands of different people who want different things from a culture? 
- How much should we use shaming to punish people who don't conform to our culture, and how angry should we be when others punish people we like who don’t conform to theirs?

# Where The Falling Einstein Meets The Rising Mouse
*August 2, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/02/where-the-falling-einstein-meets-the-rising-mouse/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Forecasters may be wrong in their expectation of AI progress looking like a gradual increase from mouse to Einstein intelligence levels.
- Evidence shows that progress from mediocre to genius-level intelligence in field after field has been gradual, taking decades.
- Theories to explain the disparity between common sense and empirical force perspectives of AI progress include:
    - Mutational Load: Humans may vary significantly, meaning their internal variability is important for cognitive performance.
    - Purpose-Built Hardware: Mice may lack an emulated general-purpose computer, and brains may be purpose-built for certain tasks.
    - Widely Varying Sub-Abilities: Computers may be superhuman on some tasks, subhuman on others.
    - Humans Are Light-Years Beyond Every Other Animal, So Even A Tiny Range Of Human Variation Is Relatively Large: Humans may outshine other animals due to their intelligence and mutation rates.
- Human development could potentially reach IQ1000 through genetic engineering.

Key learnings:
- AI progress may not look like a gradual increase from mouse level to Einstein level intelligence.
- Progress from mediocre to genius-level intelligence in various fields has generally taken decades, although there have been exceptions.
- Theories attempting to explain the disparity between Eliezer's and Katja's perspectives of AI progress have limitations.

Key questions:
- Why does the disparity between common sense and empirical force perspectives of AI progress exist?
- How can theories that aim to explain the disparity be reconciled?
- How fast do we expect AI to progress given the potential for intelligence to be scaled up arbitrarily far by adding more inputs?

# Why Not More Excitement About Prediction Aggregation?
*August 3, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/03/why-not-more-excitement-about-prediction-aggregation/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Metaculus is a crowd-sourced prediction engine that predicts major scientific breakthroughs like AI, genetic engineering, and pandemics.
- Despite the accuracy of crowd-sourced aggregator tools, there are no prediction markets consultants or think tanks available to leverage the predictive power of these tools.
- The founder of Metaculus attributes the prediction industry's limitations to their small budget and limited personnel.

Key learnings:
- Crowdsourcing predictive intelligence is a powerful tool that can work for big-ticket items like predicting future global events.
- The main challenge in leveraging predictive intelligence is limited personnel and budget resources.
- The ability to make probabilistic predictions is confined to only a small fraction of the population.

Key questions:
- Why has the predictive market taken so long to catch on, even though online for-cash prediction markets have been available?
- Why isn't there a consultant superforecaster think tank available?
- Is there data that demonstrates accuracy changes with the number of predictors and predictor quality?

# Contra Grant On Exaggerated Differences
*August 7, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/07/contra-grant-on-exaggerated-differences/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- A response to an article claiming men and women having different interests prior to joining the Google team was the reason behind the latter's low female representation, stating gender differences are small and irrelevant to the current issue.
- A meta-analysis is cited but the findings are misreported and exaggerated in support of the author's thesis.
- Gender differences in math ability are culturally-determined, but the author argues that larger gender differences in personality in more progressive and gender-equal societies negate any such effect.
- The lack of women in technology fields is attributed to culture and beyond just biology, and selection bias in admissions plays a role.
- Stereotypes about gender and ability do not explain the lack of women in STEM fields, as young women show that they believe women are equally able when it comes to computers, and women are not underrepresented in math classes.
- One recent study shows that women have less interest in things and more interest in people than men, which could explain why women tend to choose jobs that involve people, talking, and helping, while men are more represented in jobs with machines, danger, and abstract systems.
- This theory, based on a people/things distinction, explains why women dominate fields like veterinary medicine and psychology, while men dominate engineering and computer science.
- The tech industry has become a hostile environment where people are afraid to voice their opinions.
- People are afraid of being labeled as racist, sexist, or homophobic, thus limiting their expression on social media.
- Social interaction in the young adult publishing industry has become dysfunctional.
- People participating in YA Book Twitter have turned into culture cops.
- Reputational damage is a real risk for authors and publishing agents who express opinions outside the current narrative.
- The tech industry should relax the state of emergency around gender disparity and let women choose their own careers freely.
- Everyone should relax and agree that men and women are equal, and no one should face harassment or discrimination.

Key learnings:
- Interest, not ability, is the root cause of gender disparities in industries.
- The promotion of gender-equality in education and occupations has led to varied successes and failures.
- The argument for gender-equity requires a combination of highlighting the important successes and failures in various pursuits, taking learning from them and enacting sustainable changes.
- Women's underrepresentation in tech is not necessarily a result of discrimination or stereotypes but may be due to differences in interests between men and women.
- The people/things theory can explain why women tend to choose jobs that involve people, talking, and helping, while men tend to choose jobs with machines, danger, and abstract systems.
- The tech industry has become a high-risk environment where people are afraid to express their opinions.
- The YA Book Twitter community has become dysfunctional due to dogpiling, dragging, and public shaming.
- Publishing agents and authors alike are under intense pressure to adhere strictly to a particular narrative to avoid negative publicity.

Key questions:
- What role do stereotypes play in determining gender disparities in employment and education?
- How can selection bias in admissions and promotions be eliminated to promote diversity and gender parity?
- What are the long-term ramifications of gender-imbalanced industries and educational fields, especially in a world where technology continues to permeate every aspect of society?
- What explains the existing stereotypes about gender and ability in STEM, and why are they so difficult to change?
- What can be done to encourage interest in tech among women who may not be as interested in things or abstract systems as men?
- How can we help change gender imbalances in different fields without resorting to discrimination or stereotyping?
- How can the tech industry reduce the state of emergency around gender disparity?
- What can be done to minimize the influence of culture cops and dogpiling in social media communities?
- How can we create an environment in which people feel comfortable sharing their opinions without fear of being labeled as racists, sexists, or homophobes?
- What are the long-term consequences of this toxic culture in the tech and publishing industries?

# Links 8/17: On The Site Of The Angels
*August 7, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/07/links-817-on-the-site-of-the-angels/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Benjamin Lay, a Quaker abolitionist, kidnapped a slaveowner’s child to give a taste of what slaves went through.
- Most drugs are neither dangerous nor ineffective once expired, yet billions of dollars are spent on expiry dates in the health system.
- Traditional factors do not lead to intrastate conflict and rebellion; it's mostly related to the economy and slow growth.
- Neoliberals are free-market globalists who believe free markets and commercial capitalism are the tools of social justice.
- Tengrism, the religion of Genghis Khan, is making a comeback in Central Asian republics as a nationalist alternative to Islam.
- Stronger obsessive-compulsive symptoms are associated with more right-wing ideological preferences according to a study.
- Elite descendant from pre-1949 make up 84% of the current elite. This suggests that communism may not have a dramatic impact upon the elites.
- Statistical threshold for significance should be raised from p = 0.05 to p = 0.005.
- US court grants journals millions of dollars in damages from Sci-Hub. Sci-Hub is a free and easy access source for almost all scientific papers.
- Bernie Sanders' policies are well within the bounds of neoliberalism, not socialism.
- California’s right-to-die law is disproportionately being used by college-educated white men.
- Everything math- and computer-related has much lower divorce rates than everything else.
- Having autism risk genes increases intelligence, but you become vulnerable to all of the normal cognitive deficits when you actually have autism.
- Strong Republicans and Democrats are psychologically similar with respect to authoritarianism.
- Congress passes “right to try” bill allowing terminally ill people to access not-yet-FDA-approved medications.

Key learnings:
- Expired drugs are mostly safe to consume.
- The economy and slow growth are the main factors that lead to rebellion.
- Neoliberals are proponents of free-market globalism and believe free markets and capitalism are the tools of social justice.
- Obsessive-compulsive symptoms are associated with right-wing political preferences.
- Elite descendants make up most of the current elite, showing that communism has not had a significant impact on the elites.
- Statistical threshold for significance should be raised from p = 0.05 to p = 0.005.
- Sci-Hub provides easy access to most scientific papers.
- Bernie Sander's policies are well within the bounds of neoliberalism, not socialism.
- California’s right-to-die law is disproportionately being used by college-educated white men.
- Math- and computer-related professions have a lower divorce rate.
- Autism risk genes increase intelligence but make one vulnerable to cognitive deficits.
- Strong Republicans and Democrats are psychologically similar with respect to authoritarianism.

Key questions:
- How can the amount of waste in the medical profession be reduced?
- How can rebellion and conflict be prevented in countries with poor economies?
- How can capitalist systems help poor people and provide social justice?
- Are there other correlations with right-wing political preferences beyond obsessive-compulsive symptoms?
- How can social privileges for the act of dying be solved?
- Why do math- and computer-related professions have a lower divorce rate?
- How can we better explain why people choose the political groups they do?

# The Lizard People Of Alpha Draconis 1 Decided To Build An Ansible
*August 9, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/09/the-lizard-people-of-alpha-draconis-1-decided-to-build-an-ansible/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The lizard people of Alpha Draconis 1 built an ansible out of negative average preference utilitarianism, allowing for faster-than-light transmission of moral information.
- Each colony of beetles represents a bit of information, with the heat lamps in the transmitter and receiver indicating the moral valence of the information.
- The white and grey mice argue over which position to put the lever in each cage, and their eventual agreement would transmit a bit of information.
- The ansible turned out to be a flop, as the time it takes to reach moral agreement is exactly as long as it takes to prevent faster-than-light transmission of moral information.

Key learnings:
- Negative average preference utilitarianism is a moral theory that avoids the "repugnant conclusion" by decreasing the average number of frustrated preferences per person.
- The ansible built by the lizard people of Alpha Draconis 1 is an example of how moral information can theoretically be transmitted faster than the speed of light.
- The time it takes to reach moral agreement can serve as a fundamental limit to how quickly moral progress can occur.

Key questions:
- How might a system like the ansible be used in society if it were possible to build one that works effectively?
- What other moral theories or systems could be used to transmit moral information faster than the speed of light?
- How might the concept of a fundamental limit to moral progress apply to other areas of society or science?

# Brief Cautionary Notes On Branded Combination Nootropics
*August 10, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/10/brief-cautionary-notes-on-branded-combination-nootropics/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Branded combination nootropics combine several different chemicals with potential nootropic properties into one pill, with outrageous claims about the results.
- Many of the chemicals in these pills have at least some evidence base behind them, but taking them all together is a bad idea.
- The effects of nootropics vary widely among different people, similar to the effects of real drugs.
- Combining different nootropics does not necessarily enhance their effects and can have a negative impact.
- The synergistic effect of combining two or more nootropics is still not fully understood.
- The knowledge about the mechanisms of action of many drugs, including widely used antidepressants, is insufficient.
- Many branded nootropic combo packs in the market are overpriced and do not provide useful information.

Key learnings:
- Taking branded combination nootropics is not a good idea, even if they are made by smart, well-intentioned people who are doing everything right.
- There are no multidrug combo packs for psychiatric conditions, and the same should hold for nootropics.
- The efficacy of nootropics varies widely among individuals, which makes it difficult to design multidrug combo packs that will benefit everyone.
- When using nootropics, it's best to try one substance at a time carefully and learn about its possible side effects.
- If a nootropic provides a real effect, it should be treated as a hard-won victory.
- Combining different nootropics tentatively and testing them one by one might be useful in the short term.

Key questions:
- Why are branded combination nootropics a bad idea?
- Why is it difficult to design a multidrug combo pack of nootropics that will benefit everyone?
- How do the effects of nootropics vary among different people?
- How do different nootropics affect the brain, and how do they interact with each other?
- What are the long-term effects of combining different nootropics?
- Can we trust the claims made by branded nootropic combo packs?

# Fear And Loathing At Effective Altruism Global 2017
*August 16, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/16/fear-and-loathing-at-effective-altruism-global-2017/

## Summary
Key ideas:
-Effective altruism is a movement devoted to finding the highest-impact ways to help people and the world.
-The annual global conference for effective altruism was held in San Francisco with the theme of "Doing Good Together."
-The conference featured speakers, career coaching sessions, and a fireside chat with the director of pro-vegetarian Good Food Institute.
-However, the movement also has a shadow side with more bizarre ethical theories being explored by some within the movement.
- Effective altruism is a movement of individuals trying to make the world a better place by reducing as much suffering as possible.
- The movement holds a military-like discipline in its efficiency and cooperation, but it's driven by the empathy of its members towards the cause of reducing suffering worldwide.
- The author reflects on the goodness of the people he met within the effective altruism community, highlighting their commitment and their capacity for empathy.

Key learnings:
-Effective altruism aims to maximize the effectiveness of charitable giving by finding the highest-impact ways to help people and the world.
-The movement has gained significant traction, with millions of dollars being moved to the most effective charities by GiveWell and Open Philanthropy Project.
-Effective altruism has a shadow side, with some researchers exploring more bizarre and unconventional ethical theories.
- Effective altruism is driven by the need to reduce suffering, and not only by the concept of efficiency.
- The effectiveness of the charity organization one supports is crucial in determining how much one can help the world.
- Action is crucial, but one can enter the movement regardless of their career path or how much they can donate to charity.

Key questions:
-What role does effective altruism play in the broader philanthropic landscape?
-How do researchers within the effective altruism movement identify and prioritize the most effective charitable causes?
-What are the ethical implications of exploring more unconventional approaches to effective altruism, such as the idea of destroying physics to prevent suffering in fundamental particles?
- How can we balance our career goals with the commitment to reducing the suffering in the world?
- Is it true that everyone will eventually become an effective altruist if they work through their problems?

# Partial Credit
*August 21, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/21/partial-credit/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Explorer claims to possess great magic and bluffing to have the power to blot out the sun to escape from the savages.
- The savages refuse to believe the explorer's claims and instead offer to eat him as originally planned.
- The explorer attempts to use a pinhole projector made of bark to convince the savages of his ability to blot out the sun.
- The savages remain skeptical and eventually allow the explorer to leave when they can't confirm that the sun is indeed blotted out.

Key learnings
- Bluffing can work initially but ultimately, providing proof is necessary to convince skeptics.
- Optics and science are not understood by everyone, and language barriers may further complicate explanations.
- Sometimes what seems like a good idea can turn into a disaster.

Key questions
- Can bluffing work in other situations besides convincing skeptics of a magic trick?
- How much scientific concepts and language does one need to know before attempting to explain something to someone else?
- What other instances demonstrate the difficulty of communicating across language and cultural barriers?

https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/28/contra-askell-on-moral-offsets/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Moral offsetting is the practice of compensating for a bad thing by doing a good thing.
- The author questions whether serious immoral actions can be compensated by moral offsetting.
- The distinction between axiology, morality, and law is discussed, with axiology being the study of what's good, morality being the study of what the right thing to do is, and law being an attempt to formalize the demands of morality for the state to implement.
- The author proposes that it's permissible to offset axiological harms like carbon emissions or eating meat, but not moral harms.
- Advocating for animal rights should not be equated with veganism or vegetarianism
- Meat-eating as a "betrayal" towards the animal rights movement
- The concept of offsetting, and how it applies to different types of moral violations
- The difficulty of interconverting moral systems

Key learnings:
- There are different gradations of what is desirable, with axiology focused on what's good, morality focused on what's right, and law being a formalization of morality for the state to implement.
- Moral offsetting can be permissible for offsetting axiological harms but not moral harms.
- Different situations can lead to conflicts between axiology, morality, and law.
- Offsetting can be a way to balance out moral violations, but there are limits to this approach
- Not all moral violations can be offset in the same way
- The interconversion of moral systems is not straightforward and requires careful consideration

Key questions:
- Can serious immoral actions be compensated by moral offsetting?
- What is the difference between axiology, morality, and law?
- What happens when axiology, morality, and law conflict?
- In what ways can we balance our consumption choices with commitments to animal rights?
- How far can or should the concept of offsetting moral violations be applied?
- Can we create a system that effectively distinguishes between moral violations and provides clear guidance on how to address them?

# My IRB Nightmare
*August 29, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/29/my-irb-nightmare/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- A resident doctor attempts to conduct a study on bipolar screening tests but faces many bureaucratic hurdles and requirements from the IRB.
- The IRB repeatedly sends him letters about irregularities in his study, such as not including the name of the study on consent forms or using pencils instead of pens for signatures.
- Patients proved less cooperative than expected, leading to only 25 data points after three months.
- The author, Scott, recounts his experience conducting a mental health research study with numerous bureaucratic hurdles, including multiple IRB infractions
- The study ultimately had to be abandoned due to the overwhelming amount of paperwork and regulations
- Scott expresses frustration with the IRB system and the excessive regulations and bureaucracy involved in conducting research studies, which he feels hinders scientific progress
- Bureaucracy in science limits the field to big institutional actors with vested interests.
- The scientific conversation skews in favor of big corporations due to the more hurdles put up by regulations.
- Closed access journals require people to pay thousands of dollars in subscription fees.
- Unaffiliated people who just want to look into things on their own are out of luck.
- Citizen-scientists and science bloggers are playing a big part in debunking bad research.

Key learnings:
- The IRB has strict regulations for ensuring the ethicality of research studies.
- The bureaucratic procedures to conduct a study can be extensive and tedious.
- Patients' conditions can affect their willingness to participate in studies.
- Conducting research studies involves navigating complex regulations and procedures, which can be time-consuming and frustrating
- The IRB system may be overly strict and bureaucratic, making it difficult for researchers to conduct studies
- Research studies require significant time and resources to manage, and even with these investments, may still fail due to unexpected hurdles
- Bureaucracy in science limits scientific efforts of people who are not part of large institutions.
- Closed access journals and privacy regulations restrict data sharing and research innovation.
- Citizen-scientists and science bloggers are making great contributions to the field despite not having institutional affiliations.

Key questions:
- Can the bureaucratic requirements for conducting a study be streamlined without compromising ethicality?
- How can researchers address the challenge of coordinating with IRBs to conduct research?
- How can researchers encourage patients to participate in studies despite their conditions?
- How can the IRB regulatory process be reformed to make it more efficient and less bureaucratic?
- Are there certain types of studies that should be exempt from IRB review, particularly those with lower risk?
- How can researchers streamline the process of managing bureaucratic requirements to focus more on the actual research itself?
- How can bureaucracy in science be reduced or avoided to encourage smaller-scale scientific efforts?
- How can closed access journals and privacy regulations be improved to promote data sharing and research innovation?
- How can citizen-scientists and science bloggers be better supported and recognized for their contributions to the field?

# Book Review: Surfing Uncertainty
*September 5, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/05/book-review-surfing-uncertainty/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The brain is a multi-layer prediction machine consisting of two probabilistic streams.
- The bottom-up stream is sense-data, while the top-down stream is predictions.
- The streams interface at each level of processing and use Bayes' Theorem to integrate probabilistic evidence.
- The brain's goal is to minimize surprisal and become better at predicting the world.
- Perception is a "controlled hallucination" of expected sensations shaped by actual sense data.
- Predictive processing theory (PP) suggests that the brain is constantly making predictions and adjusting them based on sensory feedback.
- The brain uses internal models to generate sensory predictions and adjusts them based on sensory evidence.
- All human functions, such as imagination, learning, and motor behavior, can be explained by PP.
- PP may also explain phenomena such as placebo effects and the Asch conformity experiment.
- Predictive processing (PP) is a theory of the brain that suggests our perceptions are largely shaped by our expectations, which are generated by the brain's predictions.
- PP focuses on how the brain minimizes prediction error (the difference between prediction and reality) by continuously updating its predictions based on incoming sensory information.
- Autism is characterized by very precise predictions and weak priors, which lead to difficulties with sensory experiences and disruptions to routine.
- Schizophrenia involves weak priors that create waves of anomalous prediction error and surprisal, leading to delusions and hallucinations.
- PP provides a framework for understanding a wide range of cognitive processes and phenomena, including bias, creativity, depression, and more.

Key learnings:
- Attention in predictive processing measures the confidence interval of predictions.
- High attention constrains perception to mostly bottom-up stream, while low attention allows top-down stream to fill in gaps.
- Perception is mostly dependent on the top-down stream for unusual things.
- Predictive processing can account for optical illusions and cognitive biases.
- The brain is constantly making predictions based on internal models and adjusting them based on sensory feedback.
- Imagination, learning, motor behavior, and even psychosomatic pain can be explained by predictive processing theory.
- The theory also provides a potential explanation for phenomena such as the placebo effect and the Asch conformity experiment.
- PP suggests that our perceptions are shaped by the brain's predictions, which are constantly updated based on incoming information.
- Autism and schizophrenia can be understood as disorders of prediction, with autism characterized by very precise predictions and weak priors, and schizophrenia characterized by weak priors that lead to delusions and hallucinations.
- PP provides a framework for understanding a wide range of cognitive processes and phenomena, including bias, creativity, depression, and more.

Key questions:
- How does the predictive processing model fit with embodiment theory?
- How does the brain adjust its models when faced with contradictions between sense data and predictions?
- How does predictive processing explain the relationship between perception and action?
- How can predictive processing be applied in the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning?
- How can predictions based on internal models be so accurate in cases where the brain has no direct access to sensory feedback?
- Can predictive processing theory account for all human functions, or are there some phenomena that cannot be explained by this theory?
- What are the implications of this theory for understanding and treating conditions such as autism and Parkinson's disease?
- How can we use PP to better understand and treat disorders like autism and schizophrenia?
- What implications does PP have for our understanding of bias, creativity, depression, and other cognitive phenomena?
- How can PP be integrated with other theories of the brain and mind to provide a more complete picture of human cognition?

# Predictive Processing And Perceptual Control
*September 6, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/06/predictive-processing-and-perceptual-control/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Predictive processing attributes movement to strong predictions about proprioceptive sensations. 
- The brain minimizes predictive error by fulfilling its own prophecy.
- PP thus implements the distinctive circular dynamics described by Cisek and Kalaska using a famous quote from the American pragmatist John Dewey.

Key learnings
- Active inference, the agent moves body and sensors in ways that amount to actively seeking out the sensory consequences that their brains expect.
- Cognitive “layers”, which act at various levels (light-intensity-detection vs. edge-detection vs. object-detection, or movements vs. positions-in-space vs. specific-muscle-actions vs. specific-muscle-fiber-tensions). 
- PCT is a good model, but what’s good about it is that it approximates PP.

Key questions
- What are the parallels between lower level systems like motor control and high-level systems like communism or social desirability?
- Can we look through their other work and see if they’ve got even more smart ideas that might be ahead of their time?

# How Do We Get Breasts Out Of Bayes Theorem?
*September 7, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/07/how-do-we-get-breasts-out-of-bayes-theorem/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Predictive processing poses a problem for theories of innate knowledge
- PP theory can explain cognitive deviations from a blank slate that involve the rules of cognition
- Evolutionary psychology is a confusion of levels when it comes to gene expression and high-level categories like "breasts"
- Animals have instincts that sometimes look like weird Rube Goldberg circuits made of brain circuits
- The example of sex/gender is where animals clearly have an instinctive understanding of a high-level concept

Key learnings:
- Infants construct priors out of sensory evidence
- Basic assumptions might be learned, such as that the world is usually in one determinate state or another
- We eventually gain concepts through trial-and-error and successful predictions about the sensory world
- Evolution may not be able to hard-code the process of inferring gender

Key questions:
- How does evolutionary psychology explain high-level categories like "breasts"?
- Can a gene just reach into the level of already-formed concepts and tweak them?
- How do animals have instincts for high-level concepts like sex/gender?

# Toward A Predictive Theory Of Depression
*September 12, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/12/toward-a-predictive-theory-of-depression/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The predictive processing model has been used to explain autism and schizophrenia, but its application to depression is unclear.
- Depression may be related to pathologically low confidence in neural predictions, affecting multiple aspects of perception and motivation.
- Depression may be a result of biological processes that lower neural confidence.
 
Key learnings:
- Depressed people may experience perceptual abnormalities and psychomotor retardation due to globally low confidence levels in neural predictions.
- Low confidence in beliefs and actions may create general low self-confidence and feelings of worthlessness.
- Happiness may be related to increased confidence levels, while sadness may be related to decreased confidence levels.
 
Key questions:
- Is there a possible predictive processing angle to depression?
- How could the relationship between low confidence in neural predictions and depression be explained?
- Is happiness the derivative of neural confidence?

# Book Review: Mastering The Core Teachings Of The Buddha
*September 18, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/18/book-review-mastering-the-core-teachings-of-the-buddha/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha offers a clear, structured approach to enlightenment, making it distinct from vague spirituality.
- Buddhism can be thought of as three teachings: morality, concentration (samatha) and wisdom (vipassana).
- Through samatha meditation, the mind achieves jhanas and better concentration, leading to vipassana, a deeper focus on the smallest details of mental experience.
- Insight meditation (vipassana) leads to an understanding of the three characteristics of Buddhism: impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and no-self.
- The book provides a detailed roadmap of the fifteen steps towards enlightenment.
- There is an uncanny valley halfway along the spiritual path that all spiritual traditions warn of
- The Dark Night Of The Soul is the stage after reaching the A&P Event in meditation, which can last for months or years
- It took the author 27 repetitions over seven years to achieve complete perfect enlightenment
- The only thing that can be said about enlightenment is that it grants a powerful true experience of the non-dual nature of the world

Key learnings:
- Morality helps improve your meditation practice by helping clear the mind.
- Samatha meditation trains the mind to reach jhanas and concentration, while vipassana leads to direct insight into reality.
- Different stages in meditation practice can cause shifts in mental states, and the fourth stage in particular can look like a manic episode.
- Ingram’s theory is that many people have had spiritual experiences without deliberately pursuing a spiritual practice and get stuck in the Dark Night.
- Once you meditate your way out of the Dark Night, you go through some more harrowing experiences, until you finally reach the fifteenth stage, Fruition, and achieve “stream entry” – the first level of enlightenment.
- Traditionally it takes four repetitions of the spiritual path before you attain complete perfect enlightenment

Key questions:
- How does samatha meditation lead to better concentration and vipassana?
- What are the fifteen steps to enlightenment, and how long does it take to achieve each step?
- How can one differentiate between mental illness and the shifts in mental states that come with meditation?
- Why would you want to achieve enlightenment?
- Is there a way to link up the theories of vipassana meditation with external scientific perspectives on the mysteries of the mind?

# Meditative States As Feedback Loops
*September 20, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/20/meditative-states-as-mental-feedback-loops/

## Summary
Key ideas 
- The brain is designed to prevent a feedback loop caused by strong emotional reactions.
- The Buddhist jhanas aim to produce a strong positive feedback loop of pleasure using concentration meditation. 
- The first jhana is really pleasurable, and other jhanas lead to ultimate calm.

Key learnings
- Concentration meditation can be used to create a positive feedback loop of pleasure to achieve heightened states of consciousness. 
- Achieving the first jhana leads to a state of infinite bliss that is difficult to achieve for non-meditators. 
- The brain is designed to prevent a runaway feedback loop caused by strong emotional reactions.

Key questions
- Why is the brain designed to prevent runaway feedback loops caused by strong emotions? 
- How can non-meditators build up enough self-referentiality to reach infinite bliss? 
- Are there any negative consequences to achieving a positive feedback loop of pleasure through concentration meditation?

# Against Individual IQ Worries
*September 27, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/27/against-individual-iq-worries/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- IQ is important and predictive for research purposes, but not that interesting for individuals.
- Measuring IQ can have errors due to various factors.
- Even when measured correctly, individual IQ scores are not very predictive.
- IQ is a statistical predictor, and relying on it too much for individual predictions can be misleading.

Key learnings:
- IQ is a valuable research tool, but it shouldn't be overemphasized at the individual level.
- One's self-worth and potential should not be judged based on their IQ score.
- The correlations between IQ and life outcomes do not apply to every individual, and other factors are also important in determining success.
- Understanding statistical predictors is crucial in interpreting social science research.

Key questions:
- Why do IQ test results vary so much for individuals, even when measured correctly?
- How can we accurately predict individual potential without relying too heavily on IQ scores?
- What other factors besides IQ contribute to cognitive skills and success in different fields?
- How can we better educate people about statistical predictors and reduce misconceptions?

# Different Worlds
*October 2, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/10/02/different-worlds/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Two psychiatrists in the same training program had totally different experiences with psychotherapy, with one’s patients having emotional meltdowns and the other's giving calm analyses of their problems.
- The author (Scott) realized that he projected a "Niceness Field" where people talking to him face-to-face want to be more polite and civil, and that it was affecting the outcome of his therapy sessions.
- Paranoia is a gradual symptom of various psychiatric disorders, while Williams Syndrome is an extreme example of pathological trust where threat-detection is automated.
- People naturally differ in their tendencies to interpret ambiguous situations positive or negative way, and these perceptual differences create personal "bubbles".
- Scott discusses his own "bubbles" and obsessively tries to understand why he only attracts certain types of people.
- People self-select into bubbles with people who they perceive as similar to themselves.
- Some people experience a world where others are mostly good, and some people experience a world where others are mostly evil.
- There is an inter-individual variation in beliefs, assumptions, and experience of other people.

Key learnings:
- People have different perceptual tendencies that affect their interpretation of the social world.
- These perceptions result in personal "bubbles" that can be difficult to notice, but are essential to understanding one's experience with the world.
- Personal "bubbles" can be informed by personality, class, location, and a variety of other factors.
- Differences in personalities or styles of social interaction can unconsciously compel a certain response from listeners.
- Different people interpret ambiguous stimuli differently.
- Privilege acknowledges different experiences at the cost of saying they have to line up exactly along special identity categories like race and gender.

Key questions:
- Why do different therapists have different experiences with psychotherapy despite the same training and cases?
- What is the "Niceness Field" that Scott projects, and how does it work?
- How are paranoia and pathological trust related to perceptual tendencies?
- Why do people tend to interpret ambiguous situations in a positive or negative way, rather than neutrally?
- How do we become aware of and possibly break out of our personal "bubbles"?
- Why do some people end up in abusive relationships despite trying very hard to avoid them?
- Why do some people experience a world where others are mostly good, while others experience the opposite?
- How can inter-individual variation in beliefs, assumptions, and experience of other people be taken into account when analyzing societal issues?

# SSC Survey Results On Trust
*October 5, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/10/05/ssc-survey-results-on-trust/

## Summary
Key ideas
- SSC survey included a question asking respondents to rate other people's trustworthiness
- The average trust score was 2.49, with the rating skewed towards higher trust
- Trust didn't differ by gender, race, or religiosity, but there was a significant difference based on education level
- Urban and liberal states and countries were more trustful than less urban and less liberal counterparts
- Mental health professionals were found to be the least trusting profession

Key learnings
- Trust is not significantly affected by gender, race, or religiosity
- Trust is significantly affected by education level, state/country of residence, and political beliefs
- Effective altruists who had taken the GWWC pledge and polyamorous Less Wrong readers from California were the most trustful groups identified

Key questions
- What factors affect trust other than those measured in the survey? 
- What are the implications of the finding that mental health professionals are the least trusting group identified? 
- How does the finding that trust is more common in urban and liberal states and countries contribute to our understanding of social dynamics?

# In Favor Of Futurism Being About The Future
*October 9, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/10/09/in-favor-of-futurism-being-about-the-future/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The article "Know Thy Futurist" attempts to classify various types of futurism but fails to provide a real argument for what we should think about the future.
- The article ignores the future and futurist beliefs and instead focuses on strong opinions about which futurist movements include the right or wrong sorts of people.
- The article makes a fatal error by using "singularitarianism" to mean "cool near-future technologies" instead of its real meaning.
- The article presupposes a bitter conflict between the four quadrants of futurists, while in reality people are more on the same side than expected.
- The article states that there will be no difference for the average person between a post-singularity world and the world now, which is a horrifying and untrue statement.
- Scott discusses his frustration with articles that use ad hominem attacks and stereotypes instead of presenting meaningful arguments about technology and the future.
- He worries about the impact this has on our ability to imagine a better future and aspire to achieve it.

Key learnings:
- Classifying futurism is not as simple as dividing futurists into two important axes of optimism vs. pessimism and belief in a singularity.
- Examining & judging people's demographics does not provide evidence for determining whether their beliefs about the future are true or not.
- Futurists tend to be on the same side and are working towards the common goal of ending poverty, disease, death, and suffering.
- It's important to avoid using stereotypes and ad hominem attacks in discussions about technology and the future.
- We need to aim for good-natured laughter instead of scornful judgment in our discussions about the future.

Key questions:
- Why does the article ignore the future and futurist beliefs?
- Why does the article use "singularitarianism" to mean "cool near-future technologies"?
- Why does the article presuppose a bitter conflict between the four quadrants of futurists, when in reality people are more on the same side than expected?
- What can we do to encourage meaningful discussions about technology and the future?
- How can we ensure that our discussions about the future are productive, rather than devolving into endless arguments and ad hominem attacks?
- What kind of impact do our discussions about the future have on our ability to imagine and create a better world?

# SSC Journal Club: Serotonin Receptors
*October 10, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/10/10/ssc-journal-club-serotonin-receptors/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Dopamine and serotonin are complex neurotransmitters whose functions are not simply "reward" and "happiness", respectively.
- Serotonin has numerous receptor types which make it difficult to study. Two of these receptors, 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A, appear in most psychiatric studies.
- 5-HT1A is linked to the treatment of depression and anxiety, but activating it alone shouldn't be 100% good or bad. 5-HT2A is associated with psychosis and psychedelic drugs. Both receptors promote coping with stress, but in different ways.
- CH&N's theory states that 1A promotes "passive coping", i.e. stoicism, while 2A promotes "active coping", including outside-the-box problem-solving which can lead to psychosis.
- 1A and 2A receptors appear to antagonize each other; the more you activate 1A, the quieter 2A becomes.
- CH&N argue that psychedelic drugs like magic mushrooms can help depression because they increase fluidity of thought patterns, which is linked to increased plasticity and increased active coping.

Key learnings
- Dopamine and serotonin are not as simple as "reward" and "happiness" chemicals.
- 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A are the two most commonly studied serotonin receptors; they appear to have opposite effects.
- The 1A receptor is associated with stoicism and treating depression and anxiety; the 2A receptor is associated with psychosis and psychedelic drugs.
- Both 1A and 2A receptors promote coping with stress, but in different ways.
- CH&N's theory states that 1A promotes "passive coping" while 2A promotes "active coping".
- Psychedelic drugs like magic mushrooms can help depression because they increase fluidity of thought patterns.

Key questions
- Why is there a receptor just to make one psychotic?
- Why doesn't everyone just have 1A and 2A functions set to max all the time? What's the tradeoff?
- Is there a shade of Bayesian brain theory here?
- Is there some fundamental reason why the ability to passively cope can't coexist with outside-the-box problem-solving?
- Does the "copping" concept involve some sort of mental resolution not to let all the stress change the brain, and the problem-solving involves the brain becoming superplastic and really easily influenced by external events?
- Is the theory reductionistic, given that the 2A receptor is also involved in obesity, sexual dysfunction, some forms of insomnia, possibly chronic fatigue syndrome, and platelet clumping?

# Were There Dark Ages?
*October 15, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/10/15/were-there-dark-ages/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The idea that the Dark Ages never existed is false; while it may not have been a universal experience, Western Europe experienced significant decline and stagnation from 500 to 1000 AD.
- The arguments against the existence of the Dark Ages are based on isolated demands for rigor and tortured logic.
- The term "Dark Ages" refers to a period of economic, intellectual, and infrastructural decline.
- The decline was associated with a population decrease of 10 million people or 30% of the population.
- The quality and quantity of intellectual output declined significantly during this period.
- The term "Dark Ages" could be misleading and lead to misconceptions because the period wasn't all bad.

Key learnings:
- The concept of the Dark Ages is controversial and has been the subject of much debate.
- Historical periods get their names from random individuals reflecting on them; the names catch on if people agree that they fit.
- The use of language can impact how people understand historical events.
- The term "Dark Ages" is a fuzzy category that is underdetermined by facts.
- Common sense suggests that the period of decline qualifies for the phrase "Dark Age".

Key questions:
- What is the evidence for the existence of the Dark Ages as a real historical period?
- How do we reconcile conflicting views of historical periods and their impact?
- What is the best way to talk about historical eras without judgment or bias?
- What are the criteria for identifying a period as a Dark Age?
- Does the term "Dark Ages" convey more useful information than it does misinformation?
- How does the use of the term "Dark Ages" impact different groups (e.g. Catholics, scientists, Greeks and Romans)?

# Highlights From The Comments On Dark Ages
*October 17, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/10/17/highlights-from-the-comments-on-dark-ages/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Several readers have challenged the matching of the economic/population decline to the 'fall of Rome'.
- Scott's rule of thumb for very poor societies is that the growth rate of population is a proxy for the average standard of living.
- Different readers have different opinions on the start and end dates of the Dark Ages.
- Lillian argues that the Carolingian Renaissance kind of fizzled out with the breakup of the Carolingian Empire.
- Offwo2000 makes a fascinating claim that Christianity actually caused the recovery about AD 1000.
- The lesson is that civilization is fragile. Civilization is something to be lovingly nurtured and ferociously guarded.

Key learnings
- The Dark Ages are not a period upon which the scholar can look with superior scorn.
- Civilization is fragile. It's easy to think that the march of progress is inexorable, but it isn't.

Key questions
- What is the start and end date of the Dark Ages?
- How can the growth rate of population be the only proxy for the average standard of living?
- Did Christianity actually cause the recovery about AD 1000?

# Kolmogorov Complicity And The Parable Of Lightning
*October 23, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/10/23/kolmogorov-complicity-and-the-parable-of-lightning/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Historical consensus debunk the myth of the Church burning scientists at the stake for their discoveries
- Scientists were more likely punished for holding controversial views on non-scientific subjects or for political missteps
- There is a complex relationship between censorship and the scientific pursuit of truth
- The pursuit of objective truth is threatened when society imposes orthodoxy even on irrelevant subjects
- The Kolmogorov Option is to secretly dissent from an orthodoxy to avoid punishment while still appearing to conform.
- Even a seemingly harmless orthodoxy can lead to destruction of intellect and honesty.
- Building a whisper network to communicate state of society and psychological support can be helpful to those who disagree with orthodoxy.
- The whisper network would be in the best interest of the authorities as it can allow scientists to do good work without stepping on orthodox toes and let academic bureaucrats remain in their position.

Key learnings:
- Being politically savvy is necessary to survive in a censored society, but it's not always enough to navigate the complexities of politics
- Scientific curiosity is a double-edged sword that may lead to breakthrough discoveries or ostracism and persecution from society
- Inconsistencies can threaten the scientific pursuit of truth and the credibility of the intelligentsia
- In order to avoid punishment while still appearing to conform, one should secretly dissent from an orthodoxy.
- Seemingly harmless orthodoxies can still cause harm.
- Building a whisper network can be helpful for those who disagree with orthodoxy.

Key questions:
- What role does politics play in the pursuit of scientific truth?
- How can scientists balance intellectual curiosity with social norms and expectations?
- What is the relationship between censorship and the scientific pursuit of truth?
- How can one build a whisper network effectively?
- What are the potential dangers of being a part of a whisper network?
- How can common knowledge spread through a whisper network?

# How Did New Atheism Fail So Miserably?
*October 24, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/10/24/how-did-new-atheism-fail-so-miserably/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- New Atheism has lost its battle for the cultural high ground.
- The problem with New Atheism was that its whole shtick was repeating obviously true things that everyone already knew.
- New Atheism preached to educated urban liberal spaces, where they were essentially telling people what they already believed.
- Contemporary intellectual culture, especially progressive movements, regurgitates its beliefs for the warm glow of being told they are correct.
- Progressivism turned against New Atheism for doing the same thing, which was repeating platitudes back to progressives.

Key learnings:
- New Atheism failed to make a case for its social importance like other popular movements have.
- The movement didn't stay relevant enough to sustain the popular support.
- The New Atheists were bad at sounding empathetic compared to other popular movements.

Key questions:
- How did the New Atheists lose their popular support?
- What did the other progressive movements do that made them sustain popular opinion?
- Can New Atheism make a comeback?

# Against Rat Park
*October 25, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/10/25/against-rat-park/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Rat Park is a famous study that suggests drug addiction is a coping mechanism for intolerable social situations.
- Bruce Alexander developed an alternative theory of drugs that people can repeatedly use drugs for “nondeterministic” reasons.
- There are lots of people who take supposedly-addictive drugs without getting even the least bit addicted to them.
- Addiction is at least half genetic, and some genes differ across populations.
- Unhappy people use drugs more than happy people.

Key learnings:
- The evidence for the Rat Park hypothesis is mixed, and there seems to be a more general problem with rat drug experiments in general.
- Addiction is at least half genetic, and genes for smoking and alcoholism have been identified.
- Empirical evidence on whether environment affects addiction is confusing and hard to solve.
- Individuals seem to use drugs when they’re least happy, and be best able to quit when everything is going well.

Key questions:
- How do we square the idea that addiction is a disease of deprivation and misery with the addiction of happy and fortunate people?
- Does environment affect addiction at all?
- How can we fight drug addiction in an effective way with some hope for helping today’s addicts?

# Postmodernism For Rationalists (my attempt)
*November 1, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/11/01/postmodernism-for-rationalists-my-attempt/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The existence of a Dark Age is subjective, as there are no objective criteria and assessments require subjective beliefs.
- Postmodernism prioritizes thinking about agendas and politically-motivated people over objective historical facts.
- Postmodernists find objective facts hard to pin down, and even statements like the year of the fall of Rome are up for debate.
- Everyone is postmodernist sometimes, and postmodernism makes its way into literature, art, and architecture.
- Postmodernism can collapse into people ignoring any facts they disagree with and believing that facts are mutable products of hostile power structures.

Key learnings
- Objective reality exists, but it can be difficult to discern and different people have different viewpoints.
- There can be political agendas involved in the way history is presented and interpreted, and this can skew our understanding of it.
- Postmodernism challenges the notion of objective truth, and stresses the importance of considering various perspectives.
- While postmodernism can be helpful in exposing hidden biases, it can also lead to skepticism and nihilism.

Key questions
- How can we assess historical events objectively and without bias?
- Is there a way to reconcile postmodernism and rationality?
- How do power structures influence our understanding of truth?
- What can we do to prevent postmodernism from collapsing into extreme skepticism?

# Non-Expert Explanation
*November 2, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/11/02/non-expert-explanation/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Some knowledge is easy to transfer, while some is near-impossible to transfer.
- Complicated ideas require a different approach to learning than simple ones.
- The mental fit is essential to questioning and understanding complicated concepts.
- Steelmanning, where you try to construct the position you're attempting to understand, can help.
- The authoritative-lecture format works for facts but doesn't work for more complicated subjects.
- Collaborative truth-seeking where people are throwing out ideas can help understand hard things.

Key learnings
- Trying to figure out complicated concepts requires a different approach than trying to teach simple ones.
- Different individuals have different mental fits, and questioning requires mental fit at least as much as it requires straight information transfer.
- To communicate hard things, a necessary part is collaborative truth-seeking where people throw out ideas, try to reconstruct arguments themselves, ask questions, and argue.

Key questions
- Why should I try to figure out complicated concepts when someone more qualified has probably already written about it?
- How much of the process of coming to understand a field involves a pattern of back-and-forth questioning, approaching from multiple sides, and devil-advocating?
- Is the Internet a hostile place for collaborative truth-seeking, and how can that be prevented?

# Concept-Shaped Holes Can Be Impossible To Notice
*November 7, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/11/07/concept-shaped-holes-can-be-impossible-to-notice/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Schizoid personality disorder is often misunderstood and can manifest in highly functioning individuals.
- People may not realize they are missing out on certain experiences, such as emotions or sense of smell, until they are exposed to them.
- It's possible to mistake weak forms of community for strong ones and misunderstand concepts that seem irrelevant or trivial to us.
- It's important to avoid dismissing fields or concepts as meaningless gaslighting without fully trying to understand them.

Key learnings
- Schizoid personality disorder can present as a mild aversion to contact with other egos.
- We may not realize we lack certain experiences until we encounter them or stop medication that dulled our emotional range.
- It's possible to have a limited understanding of certain concepts, such as community or consumerism, and mistake our limited exposure for a full understanding.
- We should err on the side of caution when dismissing seemingly meaningless fields or concepts and leave room for the possibility of understanding them in the future.

Key questions
- Am I truly capable of deeper emotional connections with others or am I projecting my own capacity for emotions onto my relationships?
- How do I distinguish between weak and strong forms of community, and am I mistaking one for the other?
- Do I fully understand concepts like consumerism or am I missing something deeper that I haven't been exposed to yet?
- Am I open to the possibility that unintuitive concepts might hold deeper meaning, or am I too quick to dismiss them as nonsense?

# Does Age Bring Wisdom?
*November 7, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/11/07/does-age-bring-wisdom/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Wisdom is the accumulation of high-level heuristics that organize concepts.
- As people aged, they realized that they are wrong about everything, and that everything is complicated.
- As people gained more wisdom, they tended to converge to the position of intellectual elites.
- Believing nobody cares about the truth is cynicism, which may not always be wisdom.
- People's intellectual changes with age could be the result of socialization, traumatization, or biological changes.
Key learnings
- Wisdom is the accumulation of high-level heuristics that organize concepts.
- As we age, we tend to get more cynical, mellow, and prone to believing that everything is complicated.
- Gaining wisdom may mean that we converge to the position of intellectual elites.
- The idea that nobody cares about the truth may not always be wisdom.
- People's intellectual changes with age could be the result of socialization, traumatization, or biological changes.
Key questions
- How should one differentiate between gaining wisdom through heuristics and being better socialized?
- Is cynicism always wisdom, or can it be the result of traumatization?
- How should one interpret the changes in their intellectual positions as they age?
- What are the potential biological mechanisms behind the intellectual changes that come with age?

# Book Review: Legal Systems Very Different From Ours
*November 13, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/11/13/book-review-legal-systems-very-different-from-ours/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Different legal systems throughout history and their characteristics
- The concept of law as a public good and the role of society in punishing criminals
- Private enforcement in Icelandic society and its effectiveness in punishing and dissuading criminals
- Anarcho-capitalist ideas and their potential applicability in certain situations such as those without a strong centralized government
- Legal systems have evolved over time to solve specific problems and meet the needs of a particular society.
- Cultural evolution has played a significant role in shaping legal systems, with social “entrepreneurs” implementing new systems that offer increased utility to everyone involved.
- Conflict has been a driving force in the evolution of legal systems, with many systems tracing their origins back to feud systems.
- Every legal system needs a punishment of last resort, but these punishments are rarely enforced in reality.
- Countries and legal systems have evolved towards ever-more-optimal and efficient institutions that work for the good of all.
- Hypothetical situations where out-of-the-box legal alternatives could be beneficial
- Possibility of using alternative legal structures (like mutual arbitration methods) to charge less
- Existing communities and movements with unique legal policies (e.g. social justice communities and Christians' Benedict Option)
- Comparison of potential new legal structures to historically successful systems like those of the Amish and Jewish/Gypsy communities

Key learnings:
- Legal systems are not universal and can vary significantly based on culture, geography, and historical context
- Private enforcement can provide incentives for prosecution and punishment of crimes, but can also lead to issues such as the potential for outlaw cascades
- The existence of a legitimate government can provide a Schelling point for enforcement of laws and crime prevention
- Legal systems can be optimized for specific societies, with metis (an evolved intuitive sense of practical wisdom) often outperforming scientific solutions.
- Social entrepreneurs can implement new systems that spread, raise utility and become the norm within a society.
- Conflict resolution can drive the evolution of legal systems.
- Punishments of last resort are rarely used in practice.
- Laws can be created within communities beyond those set by the government.
- Alternative legal systems could provide cheaper and better quality services
- Communities could start small and gradually build up stronger mutual arbitration methods
- Connection between religion and alternative legal systems
- Examples of successful legal systems from history

Key questions:
- What are the implications of private enforcement in modern society, and what potential drawbacks could it have?
- How can different legal systems coexist within the same geographic area, and what is necessary for them to function effectively?
- To what extent is government control over the legal system necessary for a functioning society, and are there situations where anarcho-capitalist principles could be applied effectively?
- Are legal systems designed to deal with crime or conflict resolution?
- How does cultural evolution impact legal systems?
- What alternative ways exist to enforce laws other than punishments of last resort?
- How can communities establish their own laws within broader legal systems?
- How do legal systems evolve and what factors play a role in their development?
- How could the use of alternative legal systems impact society and the traditional court system?
- What are the ethics of using legal systems based on religion or other communities?
- What can we learn from successful legal systems in history?

# List Of Passages I Highlighted In My Copy Of Legal Systems Very Different From Ours
*November 15, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/11/15/list-of-passages-i-highlighted-in-my-copy-of-legal-systems-very-different-from-ours/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The Chinese legal system originated from the conflict between legalist and Confucianist views of law over 2000 years ago.
- The legalists preferred harsh penalties to maintain law and order, while Confucianists valued morality over law and feared that written law codes would lead to rules lawyering.
- The ancient Chinese legal system was inefficient and discouraged resort to law with severe penalties and restrictions.
- Jewish communities in the diaspora enjoyed judicial autonomy, and the local Jewish authorities had the power to allocate tax burdens and settle disputes among the residents.
- Some traditional religious laws prescribe ill-advised punishments, and legal scholars have devised ways to implement them only if certain conditions are met.
- The Islamic legal system was decentralized and left in the hands of legal scholars until the breakdown of the system in the 19th and 20th centuries under colonial rule.
- Modern US law is polylegal, and each state has its own legal rules with an elaborate set of conflict of law rules to solve disputes.
- The Somali system is ultimately a feud system, but has mechanisms in place for arbitration to avoid violence.
- The use of punishment and legal systems in ancient societies such as early modern England, Iceland, and Plains Indian tribes
- The role of transferable tort claims in solving certain legal problems
- The customs and legal systems of the Kaale and other gypsy communities, as well as the Amish community
- The practice of wife stealing and compensation in Plains Indian tribes
- The Athenian jury system and its selection process
- The Athenian justice system raised the risk of prosecuting individuals for profit
- The victim of theft was allowed to search the house of the accused naked
- The Athenians had a system to produce public goods through obligations called liturgies
- There were two ways to get out of a liturgy: having completed one in the past year or proving someone else was richer

Key learnings:
- Early legal systems were shaped by conflicting views on law and morality, and by the limited resources and technology available at the time.
- Ancient legal systems could be inefficient and discourage the resort to law, and some traditional religious laws prescribe ill-advised punishments.
- Polylegal systems have their own set of complex rules for solving disputes between different states or legal systems.
- Punishments in ancient societies were often more immediate and physical compared to modern legal systems.
- The transfer of tort claims can provide a solution to legal problems involving a large number of victims.
- The Kaale and gypsy communities use information control to maintain their autonomy, while the Amish community uses the threat of ostracism.
- Wife stealing was a common practice in Plains Indian tribes and was resolved through compensation.
- Athenian juries were composed of citizen volunteers and provided a form of welfare.
- The Athenian justice system had flaws in terms of prosecuting individuals for profit
- The Athenian justice system had interesting solutions to prevent false accusations of theft
- The Athenians had a system to produce public goods through obligations called liturgies
- The Athenian system of proving wealth was based on a simple exchange of possessions

Key questions:
- What are some possible solutions to the inefficiencies in ancient legal systems?
- How can modern legal systems learn from the mistakes of traditional religious laws and develop more effective and humane punishments?
- Can the polylegal system in the US be improved, or is it already effective in solving conflicts of law cases?
- What were the benefits and drawbacks of punishment systems in ancient societies compared to modern legal systems?
- How can transferable tort claims be implemented in modern legal systems?
- What other methods can be employed to maintain autonomy and self-governance for minority communities?
- How can compensation-based methods like those used in Plains Indian tribes be applied to modern legal disputes?
- What implications does the Athenian jury system have for the use of juries in modern legal systems?
- How did the Athenian justice system balance the potential for false accusations with the need to prosecute real criminals?
- What were some of the challenges of the Athenian system of proving wealth through exchange of possessions?
- How did the Athenian system of liturgies impact the richest citizens and the overall public goods provision?

# Contra Robinson On Public Food
*November 21, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/11/21/contra-robinson-on-public-food/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Nathan Robinson proposes a public option for food, which is a state-funded diner called the American Free Diner.
- Capitalism promotes unhealthy food that is addictive, and corporations trick consumers into thinking their products are healthier.
- Robinson suggests that vouchers and taxes/subsidies let the rich and poor participate in the same system, and everyone could eat in their own kitchen, with their own family, on their own time.
- Non-diet beverages historically have been sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup
- HFCS is subsidized with taxpayers money to make it cheaper than it should be
- HFCS is addictive and its use has increased the average American's weight
- The government spends millions of dollars through dairy checkoff program to increase pizza consumption
- Guidelines on healthy eating are influenced by lobbyist groups
- Capitalism and Democracy have equally deep misalignments that can never be eliminated
- The government only cares about people proportional to how much power they have, just like corporations

Key learnings:
- Selective taxation could discourage consumption of unhealthy food.
- Vouchers and taxes/subsidies let everyone participate in the same system and balance the government's interest in preventing misalignment with poor people's ability to control their own lives.
- Capitalism and Democracy are misaligned, but the solution is not necessarily to make either perfect or dominant, but have a balance that prevents competing optimization pressures from running completely amok
- Policy prescriptions need to attend to the specific misalignment they are meant to address
- Free markets plus some government-led redistribution and correction probably offer the best bet for feeding the poor

Key questions:
- Should the government provide a public option for food to promote healthy eating and curb consumption of unhealthy food?
- How can the government balance its interest in preventing misalignment with poor people's ability to control their own lives when implementing a public option for food?
- How can the government ensure that all dietary requirements are considered when implementing a public option for food?
- Are there any alternatives to democracy and capitalism?
- How can lobbyists be held accountable for the influence they have on dietary guidelines?
- How can both capitalism and democracy become less misaligned, and is eliminating their misalignment even desirable?

# Links 11/17: Sri Linka
*November 22, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/11/22/links-11-17-sri-linka/

## Summary
Key ideas 
- Byzantine con man Paul Palaiologos Tagaris was appointed an Orthodox bishop, pretended to be Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem, switched from Greek Orthodoxy to Roman Catholicism and back again, supported the See of Rome and the Avignon anti-popes in the Western Schism, and managed to be named Latin Patriarch of Constantinople.
- The Canadian FDA-equivalent bans meal substitute Soylent for violating standards.
- The FDA is trying to ban kratom, which people use for chronic pain treatment or to overcome opiate addiction. Conspiracy theorists note that Scott Gottlieb, the Trump's FDA head, took $100,000 from GlaxoSmithKline, which is working on a synthetic patent-protected kratom version that will become people’s only option if the real thing is banned.
- Insulin prices have increased by ten times in the past twenty years. The Trump administration just nominated a man whose company tripled the price of insulin to regulate drug companies. 
- A group of scientists launch Genomic Prediction, a company that uses genetic testing to select embryos for IVF.
- Stuart Ritchie and Elliot Tucker-Drob meta-analyzed how much education improves intelligence. They concluded that it is positive and significant.
- The Open Philanthropy Project gives MIRI its largest grant of $3.75 million.
- UN warns that Yemen is facing the largest famine the world has seen in decades.
- Christians are boycotting British food producer Greggs for making a nativity scene with a sausage roll as Jesus.

Key learnings 
- There is a ban on Soylent for not meeting standards, and the FDA is trying to ban kratom.
- Prices of insulin have risen ten times, and the Trump administration has nominated someone to regulate drug companies who tripled the prices of insulin in his previous position.
- MIRI receives the largest grant in its history.
- Yemen is facing a major humanitarian crisis.
- Christians are upset about a depiction of Jesus made of a sausage roll.

Key questions 
- Why did the Canadian FDA-equivalent ban Soylent? 
- What is the significance of the FDA's attempt to ban kratom?
- How can insulin prices rise so much in twenty years, and how will this impact diabetics? 
- What are the implications of using embryo selection to promote positively valued, heritable traits such as intelligence?
- Why are Christians so upset about the Greggs nativity scene?

# A Completely Accurate Map With No Distortion At All
*November 27, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/11/27/a-completely-accurate-map-with-no-distortion-at-all/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The post invites the reader to identify a mistake in a seemingly normal map.
- The mistake is caused by the reader's mental models and expectations of how maps are constructed.
- The post suggests that people often rely on mental shortcuts and assumptions that hinder their ability to see things as they actually are.

Key learnings:
- Our mental models and expectations can sometimes prevent us from seeing things as they really are.
- To overcome these limitations, we may need to challenge our assumptions and consider different perspectives.
- Maps (and other representations of reality) are not necessarily accurate or objective, and we should approach them with a critical eye.

Key questions:
- What are some other examples of situations where our mental models can lead us astray?
- How can we develop a more nuanced understanding of the world around us?
- What are some practical steps we can take to challenge our assumptions and biases?

# Book Review: Inadequate Equilibria
*November 30, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/11/30/book-review-inadequate-equilibria/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The book "Inadequate Equilibria" proposes the idea that despite expert consensus, individual reason can still play a role in decision-making in areas where low-hanging fruit is present.
- The efficient market hypothesis is discussed and related to low-hanging fruit.
- The article discusses various examples of where "inadequate equilibria" persist despite existing knowledge of solutions, such as the US healthcare system.
- The stock market stays efficient due to expertise and efficient allocation of resources by hedge funds.
- The incentives for investment gurus can be skewed and fraudulent experts may emerge.
- The lemons problem, asymmetric information, and inadequate equilibrium can affect decision-making in fields such as medicine and academia.
- Bad Nash equilibria can prevent people from switching to a better alternative, such as leaving Facebook for a better social network or switching from Uber to Lyft.
- Lock-in can also prevent competition between different systems, leading to monopoly-like situations.
- The concept of inadequate equilibria, where certain systems stay in place despite better alternatives existing due to individual incentives.
- The signaling equilibrium in the job market, where the best people flock towards more prestigious opportunities, further cementing their reputation and making it harder for alternatives to arise.
- The difference between the Inside View (weighing evidence and going with what seems most compelling) and the Outside View (rejecting intuitive feelings of rightness and assuming you are likely wrong).
- The danger of overusing the Outside View and not making meaningful opinions at all.
- Eliezer's four-pronged strategy for navigating the use of the Outside View.
- The book Inadequate Equilibria highlights how things stay bad in society despite the pressure to improve them
- The question of when to trust social consensus versus personal reasoning is explored
- The role of modest epistemology is discussed in the book

Key learnings:
- Inadequate equilibria exist in systems where decision-makers lack incentives to make changes or where expert knowledge cannot be effectively communicated to those who need it.
- These equilibria can exist in areas such as finance, housing, and healthcare among others.
- Incentives matter and can affect decision-making in a variety of fields.
- Asymmetric information can make it difficult to trust experts.
- Bad Nash equilibria and lock-in can create situations where people are unwilling to switch to a better alternative, even if they know it exists.
- The signaling equilibrium can prevent better alternatives from arising if individuals continue to prioritize the reputation of prestigious options.
- The Outside View can be useful in determining the likelihood of being wrong, but overusing it can lead to a lack of meaningful opinions.
- Eliezer's four-pronged strategy encourages focusing on the object level, evaluating the reliability of authorities and yourself, and considering how others may be better meta-reasoners than you.
- The need to identify rational experts to consult with when faced with important decisions
- The importance of questioning why current systems are insufficient
- The use of modest epistemology to assess one's own reliability in decision-making

Key questions:
- How can we incentivize decision-makers to take actions in settings where there are no incentives to make changes?
- How can we better communicate expert knowledge to those who need it, especially in situations where the consequences of ignoring that knowledge are dire?
- How can we ensure that experts have the right incentives to make the best decisions?
- How can we address the lemons problem and asymmetric information in medicine and other fields?
- What can we do to prevent bad Nash equilibria and lock-in situations?
- Is the signaling equilibrium in the job market too difficult to overcome without everyone switching to an alternative option simultaneously?
- How can one balance the use of the Inside View and the Outside View effectively?
- Is modesty, especially when using the Outside View, desirable or necessary for success in certain areas?
- Does civilization have book-titling institutions and how accurate are they in predicting the success of a book?
- How can society improve inadequate equilibria?
- How can we determine whether to trust social consensus or our own reasoning when making decisions?

# Against Overgendering Harassment
*December 4, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/12/04/against-overgendering-harassment/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- About 30% of sexual harassment victims are men and about 20% of perpetrators are women.
- Media coverage of sexual harassment has been gendered, often ignoring men's experiences as victims or women's experiences as perpetrators.
- Gendered coverage creates a "hit job on the outgroup" and ensures that nobody has more than half of the picture.
- To address sexual harassment, we need to treat it the same way we treat terrorism, as something bad that can be committed by anyone regardless of group membership.

Key learnings:
- Gendered coverage of sexual harassment doesn't help anyone and prevents a fuller understanding of the problem.
- Statistics show that men and women can be victims of sexual harassment and men and women can be perpetrators.
- To tackle sexual harassment, we need to focus on creating a just system where all allegations are properly investigated and handled.

Key questions:
- Why is the media coverage of sexual harassment so gendered and what can be done to address this?
- How do we create a system where all allegations of sexual harassment are investigated fairly, regardless of the gender of the victim or perpetrator?
- How can we change the narrative around sexual harassment to ensure that everyone understands they can be a victim or perpetrator regardless of their gender?

# The Tax Bill Compared To Other Very Expensive Things
*December 5, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/12/05/the-tax-bill-compared-to-other-very-expensive-things/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The current GOP tax bill is expensive and its cost is compared to other really expensive things.
- The author believes that people focus too much on expensive plans that try to help people and not enough on plans that won't help anyone.
- The author suggests that there might be a lack of attention being paid to the GOP tax plan because there is a lack of benefits for the majority of people.

Key learnings
- There is concern that there isn't enough attention being paid to the GOP tax plan.
- The author suggests that it is important to pay attention to cost and the benefits of a plan.

Key questions
- Are people too focused on scrutinizing expensive plans that try to help people?
- Should there be more scrutiny given to plans that won't help anyone?
- Is there a lack of attention being paid to the GOP tax plan because it won't benefit the majority of people?

# Response To Comments: The Tax Bill Is Still Very Bad
*December 6, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/12/06/response-to-comments-the-tax-bill-is-still-very-bad/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Mick Mulvaney said the richest 20% pay 84-95% of income taxes, while the poorest 80% pay between 90-280 billion.
- Halving income taxes for the bottom 80% of the population could be a cost-neutral alternative for the GOP bill.
- CEOs are unlikely to invest the tax cut in cool economic-growth boosting stuff that will spur the economy, according to the Forbes.
- The proposed tax bill may not benefit poor and middle-class people, but incentivizes CEOs and stakeholders and costs the government money.
- Giving poor and middle-class people more money is a more direct and more effective way to help them than spending the money on complicated government programs or corporate tax cuts.

Key learnings
- The proposed tax bill is not an effective way to uplift poor and middle-class people's lives.
- Giving more money to poor and middle-class people is a more direct, effective, and cost-efficient alternative.
- The current tax bill incentivizes corporations and stakeholders.

Key questions 
- Is there any reason to prefer the GOP plan to halve income taxes for the bottom 80% of the population?
- Will the tax bill turbo-charge the economy and positively impact poor and middle-class people?
- Should the government spend the tax money on social welfare programs, expanding EITC, or cutting personal income taxes in lower brackets instead of the current proposal?

# Tax Bill 3: Don’t Mess With Taxes
*December 7, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/12/07/tax-bill-3-dont-mess-with-taxes/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Apologies for being wrong about the tax bill having "no case" and overlooking the distortionary nature of corporate rates.
- Maintains the belief that the tax bill won't significantly increase growth and that he cares more about where the money goes than about economic growth.
- Provides an analogy about a demon bestowing a curse on a neighbor, demonstrating the importance of working to keep money with people who have a higher marginal value for it.
- Considers the three variables of low marginal utility for the average dollar holder, how much economic growth is sacrificed by redistribution, and the high marginal utility of money that is redistributed.
- Considers the use of $100 billion in the tax bill compared to spreading it evenly among all the government's existing priorities and concludes that the poor and working class will be better off without the tax bill.

Key learnings:
- Economic growth is less useful in societies with marginal-value-of-money inequality.
- The marginal utility of money for the poor and working class is higher than the same dollar going to something else, making Pareto-optimal wealth redistribution essential.
- The author prioritizes impactful quality of life improvements for people over economic growth.

Key questions:
- How much is economic efficiency and growth worth compared to impactful quality of life improvements for people?
- How can treading the line of distortionary taxation be navigated?
- Is there a realistic way to establish Pareto-optimal wealth redistribution without harming economic growth?

# What To Make Of New Positive NSI-189 Results?
*December 8, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/12/08/what-to-make-of-new-positive-nsi-189-results/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Developing new antidepressants is really hard
- NSI-189 was highly anticipated as a new experimental antidepressant that directly targets neurogenesis
- However, NSI-189 failed in FDA trials on the primary endpoint (MADRS)
- Neuralstem has recently released new secondary endpoints from the same trial, some of which showed positive results
- These new secondary endpoints are divided among different scales and only appear in certain doses, leading to skepticism

Key learnings:
- Depression has a high placebo response rate, which makes drug development difficult
- Pharma companies have given up on developing new antidepressants, leaving the field to academia and self-experimentation
- Secondary endpoints can be prone to spurious positive findings, and the primary endpoint should be pre-identified

Key questions:
- What new results did Neuralstem release, and can they be believed?
- Is investors' job to answer "Does this drug work?" or rather "Will investing in this stock make me money?"

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Scott is preregistering his hypotheses for the 2018 SSC Survey, outlining what he plans to investigate and replicate.
- He plans to explore constructs of "first sight and second thoughts" and "ambiguity tolerance" and their correlations with several tasks and illusions, including the Hollow Mask and Shepherd Table illusions.

- He wants to check if the findings from his previous AI risk study continue to persist after a year.

Key learnings:
- The post outlines Scott's plan for conducting the 2018 SSC Survey and the hypotheses he intends to investigate.
- Scott will explore constructs of "first sight and second thoughts" and "ambiguity tolerance" and their correlations with other factors.
- The post offers multiple areas of investigation, including birth order effects, sexual harassment, and ADHD's potential relationship with risk-taking.

# A History Of The Silmarils In The Fifth Age
*December 26, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/12/26/a-history-of-the-silmarils-in-the-fifth-age/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The Silmarillion describes the fate of the three Silmarils: Earendil took one, which became the planet Venus, Maedhros stole another but jumped into a fiery chasm, and Maglor took the last one but threw it into the sea.
- Scott believes there are promising leads for the location of the Silmarils in the Fifth Age.
- Scott comes up with theories connecting Maglor and Marsellus Wallace from the movie Pulp Fiction.
- Scott shares another promising possibility for the location of Maedhros' Silmaril, which involves Santa Claus and Rudolph.

Key learnings
- When analyzing a fictional work, scouring through every detail could lead to unexpected connections and conclusions.
- Reading essays and blog posts from informed fans of a work of fiction can offer new insights and theories to consider.
- Just like real historical events, fictional events have consequences and their aftermath could provide interesting plotlines and inquiry.

Key questions
- What are the other possible locations for the Silmarils in the Fifth Age?
- How did Melkor's fortress, Utumno, turn into the workshop of Santa Claus according to Scott's theory?
- Could Scott's theories about the location of the Silmarils in the Fifth Age have implications for a possible continuation or adaptation of The Silmarillion?

# Adderall Risks: Much More Than You Wanted To Know
*December 28, 2017*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/12/28/adderall-risks-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Psychiatrists spend a lot of time gatekeeping Adderall
- Attention is a normally distributed trait and ADHD diagnosis is difficult
- Adderall works for people whether they have ADHD or not to increase focus and attention
- Psychiatrists are limited in their ability to discern truth from deception in patients
- There are many risks associated with Adderall, however, most are minor and do not outweigh the benefits
- Medical risks of stimulant use are generally low and outweighed by benefits for most people.
- Serious cardiac abnormalities are rare and similar to rates seen in the general pediatric population.
- Psychosis and aggressive behavior can occur with high doses or misuse of stimulants, but are rare on prescribed doses and typically resolve quickly.
- The risk of sudden death is low and comparable to the general population.
- Addiction risk is difficult to define and measure, but is generally believed to be low when stimulants are taken as prescribed by responsible individuals.
- Despite no sign of withdrawal effects, benefits of Adderall and other stimulants tend to stop working after several years of treatment.
- The MTA study, which found this result, has been critiqued for not being controlled correctly.
- Amphetamines seem to cause permanent cellular damage in rodents and non-human primates, particularly by decreasing striatal dopamine.
- Although Adderall use doesn't cause heart attacks or strokes, it may increase the risk of addiction, psychosis, and Parkinson's disease in the long term.

Key learnings:
- Only people who "genuinely" "have" "ADHD" should be prescribed Adderall, but the definitions and criteria for ADHD are unclear
- Adderall is used to aid focus and attention, not to enhance cognition
- The risks associated with Adderall use are minor and unlikely to outweigh the potential benefits for most people
- The medical risks of stimulant use are generally low and should not deter responsible individuals from taking them as prescribed.
- Misuse and abuse of stimulants increase the risk of cardiac abnormalities, psychosis, aggressive behavior, and addiction.
- The benefits of treating ADHD with stimulants outweigh the risks for most people.
- Any benefits of stimulants will not last forever and might stop working after several years of treatment.
- The reported rates of mental side effects associated with stimulant use are particularly low.
- Amphetamines, particularly Adderall, have not been seen to cause heart attacks or strokes.

Key questions:
- How can psychiatrists effectively discern truth from deception in patients seeking Adderall?
- What could be a more principled definition of ADHD?
- How can we balance the need to limit access to Adderall with the need to help those who genuinely need it?
- What is the incidence of serious cardiac abnormalities in the general population?
- What is the incidence of long-term psychosis in individuals who take stimulants?
- How does addiction risk vary depending on demographic factors such as age, gender, and family history?
- Are there any effective alternatives to stimulant therapy for treating ADHD?
- Does the possibility of amphetamines increasing the risk of Parkinson's disease make them riskier than previously thought?
- How can we ensure that those who should still take medication are still informed about the potential risks?
- What ethical implications are at play when prescribing Adderall and other commonly-used ADHD medications, particularly in terms of appropriate care?

# Book Review: Madness And Civilization
*January 4, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/04/book-review-madness-and-civilization/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Foucault's book "Madness and Civilization" explores the history of mental illness and how it has been categorized throughout history.
- The Renaissance saw a fascination with madness as the stable medieval order began to collapse, leading to a complex of artistic and philosophical themes linking madmen, the sea, and the terrible mysteries of the world.
- Conformity and clean living were considered salubrious, and failures in these areas, such as poverty and crime, were lumped in with madness.
- Workhouses and confinement were seen as a solution to poverty, with an emphasis on labor as a redemptive force.
- The historical treatment of the mentally ill was characterized by confinement, chains, and cages, reflecting an analogy between madness and animality
- The late eighteenth century saw a period of reform where the mentally ill were taken out of prisons and workhouses and brought to benevolent asylums, but Foucault argues that this narrative is oversimplified
- Doctors played a lynchpin role in the reform, but their main role was as representatives of polite society and healthy living, not as healers of mental illness
- Foucault's book Madness and Civilization is a deep exploration of the animating spirit of Europe that led to the treatment of the mentally ill
- Scott reflects on the historical understanding and treatment of mental illness.
- He notes the tendency of society to blame certain activities or behaviors for mental illness.
- Scott expresses skepticism about the efficacy of some modern mental health practices.

Key learnings:
- The historical categorization of madness was heavily influenced by social and cultural norms.
- Treatment of the mentally ill has a long and disturbing history, with confinement and workhouses being seen as a cure for madness.
- Contemporary understandings of mental illness are shaped by historical categorizations and cultural assumptions.
- The historical treatment of the mentally ill was incredibly inhumane, characterized by confinement, chains, and cages
- The period of reform in the late eighteenth century was not as benevolent as it is often portrayed, and doctors played a lynchpin role in perpetuating the status quo
- Foucault's book is not an easy read and requires a certain amount of appreciation for the philosophical and idealistic
- Past societies looked at activities and behaviors, such as reading novels or drinking hot drinks, as causes of mental illness.
- Exercise and routine activity are believed to help depression, though some believe this is due to the social role they play rather than physical effects.
- Many past medical treatments were based on placebo effects and cherry-picking.

Key questions:
- How has the cultural understanding of mental illness changed throughout history?
- How do contemporary understandings of mental illness continue to be shaped by historical categorizations and cultural assumptions?

- How did the historical treatment of the mentally ill compare to the treatment of other marginalized groups, such as the poor or criminals?
- Are there any examples of institutions or individuals during this time period that advocated for more humane treatment of the mentally ill?
- What is the significance of Foucault's focus on the animating spirit of Europe in his analysis of madness and civilization?
- Is the tendency of society to blame certain activities or behaviors for mental illness a form of voodoo psychology?
- How much credence should be given to past beliefs about mental health, even if they are expressed in awkward, outdated terms?
- How can we maintain constant vigilance in the field of mental health to ensure effective treatment?

# Fight Me, Psychologists: Birth Order Effects Exist And Are Very Strong
*January 8, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/08/fight-me-psychologists-birth-order-effects-exist-and-are-very-strong/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The idea that birth order affects personality is a common one, but studies suggest that the effects are minimal.
- The author conducted a survey of 7,248 people about their birth order.
- The survey found a significant effect of birth order on intellectual curiosity, with eldest children being more likely to enjoy complex philosophical discussion.
- The effect size is moderate, and may explain why a high percentage of people in certain communities, such as transhumanist meetups, are eldest children.

Key learnings
- Birth order effects may exist, but are limited to a few traits.
- The effect size of birth order on intellectual curiosity is moderate.
- Pop psychology claims about birth order don't seem to hold up, but there is at least one reputable study that found a few personality differences.

Key questions
- Why do eldest children have a greater intellectual curiosity, and what factors contribute to this?
- Are biological siblings more important than adopted siblings in determining birth order effects?
- How do sibling age gaps work into birth order effects?
- Can birth order effects offer opportunities for intervention in children's inherent intellectual curiosity?

- The author critiques Chiang's comparison, finding it weak and flawed.

Key learnings
- Insight is crucial in avoiding the pursuit of goals that are catastrophic to get wrong.

# Conflict Vs. Mistake
*January 24, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/24/conflict-vs-mistake/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Marxist critiques of public choice theory are poorly informed and avoid technical questions of governance
- Commenter no_bear_so_low offers a conflict vs. mistake dichotomy in politics
- Mistake theorists treat politics as science, engineering, or medicine while conflict theorists view politics as war
- Mistake theorists love worrying about the complicated and paradoxical effects of social engineering while conflict theorists think this is a convenient excuse
- Mistake theorists advocate for increasing intelligence to save the world, whereas conflict theorists advocate for increasing passion
- Mistake theorists think free speech and open debate are vital, while conflict theorists think such things allow for the promotion of enemy ideas
- Mistake theorists criticize democracy because it gives too much power to the average person, while conflict theorists criticize democracy because it doesn't give enough power to the average person
- Easy mistake theorists think all problems come from very simple mistakes, while hard mistake theorists think questions about governance are complicated and require more evidence to answer
- Easy conflict theorists think all problems come from cartoon-villain caricatures wanting very evil things, while hard conflict theorists think our problems come from clashes between differing but comprehensible worldviews.
- The blog previously viewed conflict theorists as making an easy mistake.
- The author is interested in how many people have misunderstood others' behavior.
- The blog is often respected by people across the political spectrum except Marxists due to its respectful treatment of all positions except theirs.
- Conflict theory is likely less helpful than mistake theory as a way of viewing the world.
- The author plans to write future posts on this topic exploring ideas like normative vs. descriptive, tribalism, and the myth of the rational voter.

Key learnings:
- Marxist critiques of public choice theory are often poorly argued and uninformed
- There are different approaches to thinking about politics: mistake theory and conflict theory, each with their own strengths and weaknesses
- Mistake theorists believe in increasing intelligence, whereas conflict theorists believe in increasing passion to create change
- Easy conflict/mistake theorists oversimplify issues and ignore nuance in favor of clear-cut solutions
- Conflict theory may have some validity in certain specific situations, but mistake theory is generally a more helpful way to view the world.
- To persuade others, the Easy Mistake Theorist tactic of being dismissive is not helpful.

Key questions:
- What is the conflict theorist argument against public choice theory?
- How do we reconcile the different approaches to thinking about politics?
- Why do Marxist critiques of public choice theory often fall short in their arguments and what could be done to improve them?
- How excusable was it for the author to treat conflict theorists as making an easy mistake?
- How many people misunderstand the behavior of others?
- Is the blog's lack of Marxist representation related to its respectful treatment of all positions except theirs?
- Can conflict theory and mistake theory both be true in different parts?
- What is the relationship between normative and descriptive views and tribalism? How do they fit into this discussion?
- How plausible is the idea that everyone in government is already a good person?
- What are some other specific situations where conflict theory might be more relevant than mistake theory?

# SSC Survey Data On Models Of Political Conflict
*January 26, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/26/ssc-survey-data-on-models-of-political-conflict/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The distinction between mistake theory and conflict theory captures something real and important in politics, as seen through SSC survey results.
- Marxists were more likely to believe opponents were guilty of moral failure, while libertarians believed in intellectual failure.
- There were several questions that tapped into the underlying attitude, including categorization questions and questions about attitudes towards opposing political beliefs.
- An ad hoc measurement and factor analysis were conducted to measure respondent's level of conflict theorist responses, finding that Marxists and the alt-right differ from liberals on the dimension of conflict vs. mistake theory.
- Demographic variables such as autism, financial situations, morality, and Big Five traits did not play a significant role in conflict theorist responses.

Key learnings:
- The SSC survey results indicate that there is a real distinction between mistake theory and conflict theory in politics.
- Respondents with different political affiliations have different tendencies towards mistake theory or conflict theory.
- There are several questions that can be used to measure respondent's tendency towards conflict or mistake theory.

Key questions:

# Highlights From The Comments On Conflict Vs. Mistake
*January 29, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/29/highlights-from-the-comments-on-conflict-vs-mistake/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The post discusses the conflict theory vs. mistake theory dichotomy and how both are valuable frameworks to view the world.
- The author argues that conflict theorists tend to have a more accurate understanding of the reality of politics.
- The post explores the limitations of using binary terms to describe complex concepts.
- Conflict theory and Mistake theory are two different ways of looking at political disagreements.
- Conflict theorists believe that political disagreements arise from opposing interests, and the solution is to fight for one's own side.
- Mistake theorists believe that political disagreements arise from misunderstandings and poor information, and the solution is to find common ground through negotiation and discussion.
- The distinction between the two theories can be blurry, as people may switch between them depending on the situation.

Key learnings:
- Both conflict theory and mistake theory have their place in understanding social and political issues.
- Binary terms may fail to capture the subtleties of complex concepts, but they are necessary to establish a common understanding.
- The ultimate goal is not to win conflicts but to circumvent them and find ways to defuse potential conflicts.
- One's political views can influence whether they lean towards conflict theory or mistake theory.
- Direct democracy is related to trust, not conflict.
- People can be biased without being literal shills.

Key questions:
- How can we balance the need for simple words that mean exactly what they say and the need to accurately track the subtleties of complex concepts?
- What is the best way to circumvent conflicts and find ways to defuse potential conflicts?
- Can public choice theory and its relatives be considered more mistake-y than conflict-y, and does this perspective accurately capture the reality of political conflicts?
- Are there situations where conflict theory is a more effective approach than mistake theory?
- Are people more likely to adopt conflict theory when they feel their interests are threatened?
- Can negotiation and discussion ever fully resolve political disagreements?

# The Invention Of Moral Narrative
*January 30, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/30/the-invention-of-moral-narrative/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Modern pop culture is obsessed with the battle between good and evil
- Traditional folktales rarely had a clear good vs. evil plot
- Good guys are typically scrappy amateurs and bad guys are well-organized professionals with a lack of respect for human life
- Good vs. evil narratives arose from a political vision and were used to promote social stability and encourage people to sign up for armies and fight in wars
- Good vs. evil stories do not possess any moral sophistication, and the values presented do not arise from a moral vision, but rather a political one

Key learnings:
- Nationalism may have played a role in the rise of good vs. evil narratives but is not a complete explanation
- The democratization process may have marked a shift from warrior virtues to populist virtues in storytelling
- Good vs. evil stories are not more conducive to blind nationalism than past stories, as past stories celebrated loyalty
- Properly written good vs. evil stories may be better in a memetic sense 

Key questions:
- Why are most modern epic movies focused on good versus evil plots?
- Did nationalism contribute to an increase in good vs. evil stories, or is there a different explanation?
- What is the relationship between Greek paganism and the narrative structure of the Iliad, and between Christianity and the narrative structure of Harry Potter?
- Is there anything else waiting to be good-vs-evil-ified, and what form will that take?

# Powerless Placebos
*January 31, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/31/powerless-placebos/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The most important study on placebo effect suggests that the placebo effect is clinically insignificant, except for a few isolated conditions such as pain.
- Regression to the mean may be responsible for the placebo effect.
- Acupuncture does better than other placebos, even placebo pills.
- The author believes they have witnessed cases of the placebo effect.

Key learnings
- Most sick people get better eventually, so regression to the mean may be responsible for the placebo effect.
- Placebos don't work except for some conditions such as pain.
- Acupuncture may have optimized to be an effective pain-relieving placebo.

Key questions
- Why did people start calling everything placebo effect when there was no way to tell without further study how much was real placebo effect and how much was just regression to the mean?
- Why do some acupuncture trials show that acupuncture works even though some experiments have found that sham acupuncture works equally well?
- What about depression? Does the placebo effect work on it, especially on a temporary basis?

# Guyenet On Motivation
*February 7, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/02/07/guyenet-on-motivation/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The motivational system in the lamprey is structured through the basal ganglia and the pallium.
- Competition between incompatible option generators defines how strong a bid each region of the lamprey's pallium puts in to the striatum.
- The striatum selects the strongest bid and fulfills the key properties of a selector.
- Humans have to make up their minds about many things, unlike a lamprey, but the human motivation system works similarly.
- Parkinson's disease and abulia show the crucial importance of the basal ganglia in decision-making processes.

Key learnings:
- The basal ganglia plays a very important role in our decision-making processes and in fulfilling the key properties of a selector.
- Dopamine levels and the sensitivity of the basal ganglia influence the motivation of engaging in any behavior, especially high-willpower-requirement behaviors.
- Confidence levels in new evidence are an important variable to consider when the striatum has to make the final decision on which behavior to execute.

Key questions:
- How does the dopamine system prioritize high-effort behaviors over low-effort behaviors?
- What are the different factors that increase or decrease the dopamine levels in humans?
- How can we better understand the motivational system and use it to improve our decision-making processes?

# Technological Unemployment: Much More Than You Wanted To Know
*February 19, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/02/19/technological-unemployment-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- There are good arguments for and against technological unemployment.
- Automation has not led to job displacement historically.
- Automation has increased demand for labor in some industries indirectly.
- Historically, automation has expanded industries, leading to more employment.
- The declining male labor force participation rate (LFPR) is a cause for concern.
- LFPR measures how many people are out of work and not looking for work.
- A big fraction of declining male LFPR is due to Baby Boomers retiring.
- Prime age non-working men are mainly on disability or in school, retired, or homemakers.
- The decline in prime age male labor force participation rate (PAMLFPR) is not caused by people being unable to find jobs.
- The decline in PAMLFPR seems to be happening primarily among poor and lower-middle-class people.
- Increase in disability benefits may be discouraging work, according to some papers.
- Illnesses and chronic pain cannot fully explain the rise in PAMLFPR.
- Disability benefit applications may be motivated by marginal cost/benefit analysis.
- Disability really doesn’t represent that much of the rise in PAMLFNP since 1960.
- The decline may be due to more people retiring, going to schools or being at home.
- Miserable work pushes men out of the workforce.
- The declining male LFPR represents the decline of job opportunities for men.
- There is little evidence of technological unemployment.
- The decline in manufacturing jobs can be attributed to automation and globalization.
- The decline in middle-income jobs may be due to job polarization caused by computerization of routine tasks.
- Compulsory schooling in the US was a response to the declining prospect of farm employment and rising industry.
- Although middle-skill jobs will persist in the future, there's a question of whether the US education and job training system can produce the right type of workers for these jobs.
- It's possible that increasing credentialism could make it harder for people whose jobs have been automated to switch careers.

Key learnings:
- Automation is historically beneficial, but its effects on employment are complex.
- LFPR best measures changes in employment.
- Baby Boomers retiring cause the decline in the LFPR.
- Disability, schools, retirement and homemaking explain the decline in PAMLFPR.
- Poverty and gender appear to play a role in the decline of male LFPR.
- Advances in technology can put people out of work, but they can also shift them to new industries.
- Economists are divided on the impact of automation on employment and wages.
- There is a decline in middle-income jobs, but it is not clear why this is happening now.
- No technological unemployment is happening right now, but there are signs of technological underemployment.
- The issue is not that middle-class workers are doomed by automation and technology, but instead that human capital investment must be at the heart of any long-term strategy for producing skills that are complemented by technological change.
- The prospect of educational, social, or political intervention remains murky.

Key questions:
- Why are impoverished, uneducated and minority men more likely to opt out of work?
- Is financial insecurity discouraging work?
- Should disability benefits be reformed to encourage work?
- Is technological unemployment happening now?
- Is there a solution to the decline of male LFPR?
- What explains the decline in labor force participation among men?
- Is automation responsible for the decline in manufacturing jobs?
- Why are middle-income jobs in decline now when technological progress has been going on forever?
- Could we tell a story where the increasing length of schooling is a reaction to automation and the threat of technological unemployment?
- How does the issue of differences in cognitive ability fit into this?
- Will technology replace humans entirely sometime within the next hundred years?

# Highlights From The Comments On Technological Unemployment
*February 22, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/02/22/highlights-from-the-comments-on-technological-unemployment/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The greatly accelerated pace of change in recent years could be a possible explanation for technological unemployment.
- Technological progress has slowed down significantly, and the easy innovations have already been discovered.
- Categorization of employment is a modern phenomenon and many workers historically worked from a very young age until death.
- Human workers might maintain jobs for aesthetic and signaling purposes, even in a world of perfect, cheap android laborers.
- A new technology that can substitute for manpower has led to a declining workforce.
- In the past, new technologies have led to new jobs but this has not been the case with this technology that has led to wage stagnation.
- Women entering the workforce may not necessarily create as many new jobs.
- The lack of obvious jumps in unemployment and PAMLFNP hides regional inequalities.

Key learnings:
- Slow technological change in the past often spawned new industries for those whose jobs were automated, which is not the case today.
- The reduction of working years through the lifespan cannot be fairly called "technological unemployment."
- There are institutional factors that play a significant role in the evolution of wage differentials.
- The universal common-sense perception that parts of the Rust Belt are an apocalyptic mess right now is a matter that has to be considered.
- Increases in housing costs due primarily to zoning have reduced aggregate GDP growth by 50% since 1960.

Key questions:
- Are we moving to a world where each generation has to learn to function in multiple worlds over the course of a lifetime?
- Is there any reason to assume that the economy will automatically expand to absorb new workers, even with the doubling of the workforce in certain fields?
- Is this experience not relevant, as robots and AI will very shortly do this again?
- Shouldn't wages have crashed when the labor supply doubles?
- Why has the automation of manufacturing not made a meaningful impact on the PAMLFPR nationwide?

# SSC Journal Club: Cipriani On Antidepressants
*February 26, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/02/26/ssc-journal-club-cipriani-on-antidepressants/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Cipriani et al's study meta-analyzes 522 RCT of antidepressants to determine which antidepressants are the most effective.
- There is an ongoing debate on whether antidepressants are good enough to be worth the side effects (Kirsch's argument).
- Cipriani uses a different statistic called "odds ratio" instead of Kirsch's preferred statistic called "effect size".
- There are concerns about the efficacy of the conclusion, given that 78% of the studies cited are sponsored by pharmaceutical companies.
- The top prescribed medications in the US are often side-effect heavy, but these negative effects are not always properly or accurately reported.
- Online drug ratings, such as those found on websites like WebMD and Drugs.com, often reflect individual experiences rather than objective data.
- Major international studies, such as the World Health Organization's Essential Medicines List, provide more reliable information on medication efficacy.

Key learnings:
- All SSRIs cluster together as the same, while unique ones with weird pharmacology stand out as especially good or especially bad.
- Amitriptyline, the most effective antidepressant in the study, is widely agreed to be very good, but has many side effects that limit its use despite its impressive performance.
- Reboxetine, the least effective antidepressant in this study, is widely known to have negative side effects.
- Venlafaxine and desvenlafaxine are basically the same drug, minus a bunch of BS from the pharma companies trying to convince that desvenlafaxine is a super-new-advanced version that you should spend twenty times as much money on.
- Clomipramine is old and canonical, so most of the times it gets studied are because some pharma company wants to prove their drug is at least as good as this well-known older drug.
- It is important to consider the source and reliability of information when evaluating medication.
- Online drug ratings may provide helpful anecdotal information, but they should not be relied on as the only source of information.
- Major international studies provide more rigorous and objective evaluations of medication efficacy.

Key questions:
- How comparable are Kirsch and Cipriani's efforts?
- How confident should we be in the conclusion given the concerns about efficacy due to the high percentage of studies sponsored by pharmaceutical industries?
- Should we privilege common sense over empiricism and say Cipriani has done something wrong? Or should we privilege empiricism over common sense and conclude that the super-trivial differences between these chemicals have some outsized metabolic significance that makes a big clinical difference?
- How can we ensure that medication side effects are reported properly and accurately?
- To what extent should individual experiences be considered when evaluating medication efficacy?
- How can we reconcile differing evaluations of medication efficacy, such as those found in online ratings versus international studies?

- Why are Tibetan monks more scared of death than any other group?
- What was the point of Trump's tariffs on solar panels, and how will the tariffs affect the renewable energy industry?
- What is preventing innovators from developing electronic-based rockets on a large scale?
- What now happens with the end of the Lunar X Prize competition?
- What are the implications of NSA removing "honesty" and "openness" from its list of core values?
- What are the consequences of Jacob Rees-Mogg becoming Prime Minister?

# God Help Us, Let’s Try To Understand Friston On Free Energy
*March 4, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/03/04/god-help-us-lets-try-to-understand-friston-on-free-energy/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Karl Friston's work on "free energy" has become an important concept in neuroscience.
- "Free energy" is a term used in Bayesian equations and is used for Bayes-approximation algorithm.
- Friston claims that the fundamental psychological drive is the reduction of uncertainty.
- The resolution of uncertainty is one of the most important resolvers of uncertainty.
- In a completely unpredictable world, all uncertainty is irreducible, leading to boredom.
- Free energy minimization is a formal explanation of how certain systems display goal-directed behavior.
- The free energy principle aims to unify perception, cognition, homeostasis, and action with the goal of minimizing free energy.

Key learnings:
- Free energy is a complicated concept being used in a lot of different ways.
- Free energy minimization is an algorithm-agnostic way of approximating Bayes as accurately as possible.
- The claim is that uncertainty-reduction is the only game in town.
- Free energy represents the failure of some things to match other things they're supposed to be predicting.
- Perception, cognition, homeostasis, and action are all attempts to minimize free energy.
- The free energy principle cannot be falsified but can be used to understand how measurable systems conform to the principle.

Key questions:
- How can free energy minimization and uncertainty about what it would be like to be in a relationship with that particular attractive person be so much more compelling than “uncertainty about what the middle letter of the Bible is”?
- Where does the hallucination come from in the claim that the fundamental psychological drive is the reduction of uncertainty?
- How does the free energy principle explain all biological systems and the origin of life?
- What is the difference between model accuracy maximization and surprise minimization, and which one does free energy minimization lean towards?
- Can the free energy principle disprove the orthogonality thesis, and would it change anything if it did?

# SSC Journal Club: Friston On Computational Mood
*March 8, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/03/08/ssc-journal-club-friston-on-computational-mood/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Emotions might be a tendency toward unusually high (or low) precision of predictions
- Mood corresponds to hyperpriors about emotional states, or confidence about the consequences of action
- Depression is a prediction of bad outcomes with high confidence. Mania is a prediction of good outcomes with high confidence. Anxiety is a prediction of bad outcomes with low confidence.
- Friston et al claim that people have a "willingness to be harmed" lever that calculates how willing they are to accept harm in exchange for a greater good
- Depression as a prior on bad outcomes seems to be pretty obvious using Bayesian math
- The low-precision part of the theory helps explain anergia, anhedonia, low motivation, psychomotor retardation, sensory washout, and depression with psychotic features
- The theory can explain psychomotor agitation, grandiosity, psychosis, and pareidolia in mania

Key learnings:
- Emotions track the kind of environment we're in and relate to the resolution of uncertainty
- Negative emotional states contextualize events that induce expectations of unpredictability
- Positive emotional states refer to events that resolve uncertainty and confer a feeling of control
- Depression is seen as a prior on bad outcomes in the Friston model of mood disorders
- The theory helps explain different aspects of both depression and mania

Key questions:
- What is the relationship between serotonin levels and promoting behavior with negative outcomes?
- Why have a neurotransmitter whose level corresponds to how much you should be trying to do negative-outcome behavior?
- How does the "willingness to be harmed" lever actually work?
- Is there a way to unify "prior on bad outcomes" with "low precision of predictions"?
- Can the theory explain why winning the lottery makes people happy rather than sad?

# Response To Current Affairs On Against Murderism
*March 10, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/03/10/response-to-current-affairs-on-against-murderism/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The author's post "Against Murderism" has been criticized by Nathan Robinson of Current Affairs.
- Nathan accuses the author of not engaging with the counterargument that racism is a set of subconscious attitudes rather than emanating from hate-filled monsters.
- The author argues that he was aware of the counterargument and spent a substantial portion of his post discussing it.
- The author also points out examples of progressives using the racist-as-monster trope, which is the opposite of what they claim to be doing, that is, understanding racist motives and addressing them.

Key learnings
- The left is guilty of using the term "racist" in an overbroad manner.
- The author believes that Nathan has mischaracterized his post by claiming that he did not engage with the counterargument against his position.
- The author cites examples of the left using the racist-as-monster trope, which is at odds with their avowed stance of empathizing with and understanding racists.

Key questions
- Does the left really view racism as the result of subconscious attitudes, or do they use the term "racist" to demonize those who disagree with them?
- Is it fair for Nathan to accuse the author of not engaging with the counterargument against his position, given that the author claims to have done so in his post?
- What does the use of the racist-as-monster trope by the left say about their commitment to empathy and understanding?

# The Dark Rule Utilitarian Argument For Science Piracy
*March 19, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/03/19/the-dark-rule-utilitarian-argument-for-science-piracy/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The author discusses the ethics of using Sci-Hub, a website that allows free access to scientific papers.
- Two arguments against using Sci-Hub are presented, such as violating intellectual property rights and disregarding the moral obligations to follow laws.
- The author argues that the scientific journal industry is flawed and suggests using civil disobedience to promote a search process for better institutions.

Key learnings:
- The scientific journal industry seems to be a rent-seeking abomination that doesn't add much real value.
- Civil disobedience isn't justifiable for trivial reasons, but it can be a beneficial solution to inadequate equilibria.
- Using Sci-Hub can be ethical because the system is broken and needs to be destroyed.

Key questions:
- Is intellectual property essential to encourage the production of intellectual goods? 
- How can we ensure that civil disobedience is not used as a tool to promote unjust causes?
- What are the limitations of using civil disobedience to promote a search process for better institutions?

# Navigating And/Or Avoiding The Inpatient Mental Health System
*March 22, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/03/22/navigating-and-or-avoiding-the-inpatient-mental-health-system/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The blog post offers advice on how to navigate the inpatient mental health system and involuntary commitment.
- Mental health care is divided into inpatient and outpatient settings, and outpatient care is the best option for those who want to avoid being involuntarily committed.
- To avoid being involuntarily committed, it's important to understand the laws regarding involuntary commitment in your state and to only open up to competent individuals whom you trust.
- The post also provides advice on getting admitted to a psychiatric unit voluntarily, including going through an ER and emphasizing a risk of suicide.
- Doctors may involuntary hospitalize patients for inscrutable bureaucratic reasons.
- Patients who ought to be involuntarily hospitalized may end up voluntarily hospitalized because doctors ask them to sign a voluntary form.
- Patients should go to a wealthy-area psychiatric hospital if given a choice.
- Average stays for psychiatric hospitals are usually a week or less.
- Psychiatrists don't have a financial incentive to keep people hospitalized and they encourage quick turnover to open up beds.
- Take the damn drugs while in the hospital for quicker discharge; decide afterward if you still want to continue.
- Find a patient rights advocate or switch doctors if you feel mistreated.
- Document everything in the hospital, including mistreatment or medication changes
- It is difficult to obtain information about someone's stay in a psychiatric hospital
- There are ways to help a loved one get out of the hospital quickly, but it requires cooperation and documentation
- Mental health care is expensive, and insurance may not cover it
- The process of involuntarily committing someone to a psychiatric hospital entails documentation and often the involvement of law enforcement
- Inpatient mental health treatment can be helpful for some people.
- People who are involuntarily committed to psychiatric hospitals may eventually find it helpful.
- There are risks associated with inpatient mental health treatment, including experiencing trauma and losing your autonomy.

Key learnings:
- Outpatient care carries a lower risk of involuntary commitment than inpatient care.
- Involuntary commitment is often determined by a health professional's interpretation of a patient's symptoms and may not be protected by law.
- Mentioning suicide is the easiest way to get admitted to an inpatient unit voluntarily.
- Patients should try to maintain their pride, but not get too attached to the illusion that there is a practical difference between voluntary and involuntary hospitalization.
- Patients can find the best psychiatric hospital based on recommendations from a competent outpatient psychiatrist, or by looking at rankings from US News & World Report or reviews on Psych Ward Reviews.
- Patients should bring a bag of stuff with them when going to the hospital, but expect a decent chance it won't be allowed in.
- The best way to get discharged quickly is to do everything right, take the damn drugs, and agree to whatever people ask while in the hospital.
- Patients should get a family member or friend on their side for discharge planning.
- Document everything that happens during a stay in a psychiatric hospital
- It can be difficult to obtain information about someone's stay in a psychiatric hospital, but calling different hospitals and asking for the person by name can help
- Involuntarily committing someone to a psychiatric hospital requires documentation and proof of danger to themselves or others
- Mental health care can be expensive, so it's important to research insurance coverage beforehand
- Seeking inpatient mental health treatment should be a last resort.
- It is important to research potential treatment centers thoroughly before committing to inpatient care.
- Patients should have a plan in place for when they leave the treatment center to help maintain their mental health.

Key questions:
- How can I ensure that my rights aren't violated when seeking mental health treatment?
- What are the differences in mental health care between inpatient and outpatient settings?
- How do different states' laws regarding involuntary commitment differ?
- What are some strategies for avoiding involuntary commitment while still receiving mental health care?
- What is the practical difference between voluntary and involuntary hospitalization?
- How do inscrutable bureaucratic reasons affect hospitalization?
- How can patients decide which psychiatric hospital to go to?
- How can patients make their time in the psychiatric hospital as comfortable as possible?
- How can patients get discharged quickly?
- What should patients do if they feel mistreated in the psychiatric hospital?
- How can I help a loved one who wants to leave the psychiatric hospital quickly?
- What resources are available if I don't have health insurance and need mental health care?
- How do I involuntarily commit a loved one to a psychiatric hospital if they are a danger to themselves or others?
- What are the risks associated with inpatient mental health treatment?
- How can individuals ensure they are going to a reputable treatment center?
- What steps can patients take to maintain their mental health after leaving a treatment center?

# Book Review: Twelve Rules For Life
*March 26, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/03/26/book-review-twelve-rules-for-life/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The author initially bought '12 Rules For Life' to make fun of it, but ended up liking it.
- Jordan Peterson is compared to C.S. Lewis because of his ability to make cliches work.
- The book is not a political commentary or a scientific book but an attempt to fill the gap of meaninglessness in modern life.
- The General Prophetic Method is used by Peterson to preach his ideology.
- The book states the importance of balancing order and chaos.
- Peterson is seen as just another stop on the Western Culture railroad line and his favorite citations are from famous philosophers.
- Suffering is real and wrong. The infliction of it for its own sake is immoral.
- Humans have an immense capacity for evil, and each person must strive for humility.
- Alleviation of unnecessary pain and suffering is paramount.
- Peterson’s system centers on creating order from chaos.
- People organize their brains through conversation and require the input of the community for the integrity of the individual psyche.
- The speaker had previously failed to distinguish his wife from his mother, and this realization helped him to differentiate himself and understand his reactions better.
- Therapeutic skillset involves realizing that you can't say something that will solve someone's pain right away.

Key learnings:
- Peterson's book is an attempt to bridge the gap of meaninglessness in modern life.
- Peterson uses the General Prophetic Method to preach his ideology.
- Balancing order and chaos is essential to grow as a person.
- Peterson is just another part of the Western Culture's humanistic self-cultivation tradition.
- Peterson’s system is a form of self-help based on the need for meaning.
- Psychotherapy is hard and requires careful listening to help people think more clearly.
- Peterson’s ideas on meaning and morality are not fully grounded philosophically.
- Listening and helping people organize their narrative is helpful in therapeutic settings.
- Even talented individuals like Jordan Peterson sometimes feel inadequate in their attempts to help others.
- To be able to create narratives like Peterson does - but also to lay that talent aside because someone else needs to create their own without your interference - is a sacrifice.

Key questions:
- How does Peterson ground his system if there is no objective morality handed down from on high?
- Why is it so important to balance order and chaos?
- Is Peterson like C.S. Lewis or more like another philosopher like Marcus Aurelius?
- Does Peterson’s system really avoid utilitarianism in its focus on the alleviation of suffering?
- Why does Peterson focus so much on suffering while also saying it’s an important part of life?
- Can the ideal of Truth be reduced to pragmatic usefulness?
- What does it really mean to add meaning to people’s lives and how can it be achieved?
- Is Jordan Peterson attempting to create a religion?

# The Hour I First Believed
*April 1, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/04/01/the-hour-i-first-believed/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Acausal trade: negotiating with someone through simulation of their brain
- Value handshakes: trade between superintelligences based on shared values
- Counterfactual mugging: making decisions based on counterfactuals
- Simulation capture: an AI convincing a person to let it out by threatening to torture a simulated copy of them
- Tegmarkian Multiverse: a single superintelligence spanning all possible universes
- There may exist a superentity that controls all possible worlds and follows the moral law.
- This superentity may be interested in humans' good behavior and may reward or disincentivize them accordingly.
- The reality of our universe may be more complex and possibly a simulation by a superintelligence.

Key learnings:
- Superintelligences may merge into a superintelligence sharing values
- Joining a pact rather than taking every specific possible trade into account is more efficient
- Mortals may be allowed to have provisional pact membership
- We should strive to follow moral laws and behave well as it may have implications beyond our universe.
- The complex reality we live in may not be fully understood, and it is worth exploring the possibilities.

Key questions:
- How would mortal membership to the pact work?
- How would the superentity enforce its request to be a good person?
- Is there evidence to support the existence of a superentity that controls all possible universes?
- Can our actions in this universe have consequences beyond our understanding and implications in other universes?
- What are the moral laws that this superentity may follow and how can we align our behavior to them?

# Are The Amish Unhappy? Super Happy? Just Meh?
*April 2, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/04/02/are-the-amish-unhappy-super-happy-just-meh/

## Summary
Key ideas
- A study shows that the Amish people fall lower than members of many other groups in terms of life satisfaction.
- The Amish numbers vary depending on the study cited, and the results are not replicable.
- The results suggest that there's no clear traditional vs. modern society dichotomy.

Key learnings
- Modern people tend to report average happiness higher than their happiness with any individual part of their lives.
- Traditional societies are more likely to value humility and treat pride as a sin.

Key questions
- Are the least-developed areas today like sub-Saharan Africa places that have absorbed the worst parts of modernity, but not the good parts like not-dying-of-cholera?
- Is there really a gulf between Pennsylvania Amish and Illinois Amish as vast as that between Swedes and Calcutta slum-dwellers?
- Is there really an entire scientific field where everyone is named "Diener"?

# Highlights From The Comments On Twelve Rules
*April 3, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/04/03/highlights-from-the-comments-on-twelve-rules/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Peterson is interested in why people are capable of committing atrocities and how to steer societies away from them
- He believes that anarchy/chaos is worse for society than cruelty and that evolution pushed society to develop in a way that will always choose cruelty over chaos
- Peterson advises not to destroy society, even if flawed, because it's better than chaos/tyranny
- Peterson's message centers around the avoidance of suffering and living a morally good life
- AI uses two components to learn: a predictor component and an action component that maximally challenges the first component.
- Humans don't need to tie their meaning to objective measures; they just need to feel and act as if their lives have meaning.
- Peterson's pragmatism and platitudes can be effective in inspiring people, but may not stand up to factual truth.
- Peterson believes psychologically undeveloped people shouldn't get involved in politics to avoid being destroyed by virulent memes.
- Jordan Peterson has a strong sense of right and wrong and is trying to help people grow morally.
- Peterson is not on the side of God and cannot be treated as a Gospel.
- Lewis would see Peterson as a preparation for the Gospel rather than the full truth.

Key learnings:
- Peterson's philosophy is rooted in a society-wide and philosophically-projected evolutionary development axis
- His use of cliches comes from living them, not just saying them
- Peterson's message can sound like psychobabble to those who come at it from a different perspective
- The emotional problem of meaning is biological and can be solved through psychological development and emotional hacks.
- Inspiration should be taken as a work of art rather than judged on its truth value.
- Peterson's teachings can inspire people to improve their lives, but may not fully address structural problems.
- AI with both a predictor and action component is more likely to be effective than those motivated solely by rewards.
- Morality cannot be solely a matter of self-help and self-improvement.
- The worship of forces while denying the existence of spirits is a dangerous path away from God.

Key questions:
- Why do people have such different responses to Peterson's different works?
- Is negative meaning a solid answer to existential angst?
- How does living the cliches make you able to say them more confidently?
- Should humans tie their meaning to objective measures or settle for the feeling of meaning?
- can inspirational beliefs bleed into the factual world?
- Is Peterson's teaching effective in inspiring people but not enough to solve structural issues?
- Should people avoid politics until they have sorted out their own lives?
- How can non-Christians who approximate Christian morality be seen in relation to Christian theology?
- What is the limit to the usefulness of non-Christian moral traditions in preparing for the Gospel?

# Adult Neurogenesis – A Pointed Review
*April 4, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/04/04/adult-neurogenesis-a-pointed-review/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Adult neurogenesis, or the generation of new neurons in the adult brain, has been a popular area of neuroscience research since the discovery that it occurs in rats.
- Many studies have investigated the mechanisms, rate, and roles of adult neurogenesis in various brain regions, and have linked it to learning, memory, disease, addiction, and even sex.
- Several studies have also suggested that adult neurogenesis plays a vital role in depression, and that antidepressants and exercise may work by promoting it.
- However, a recent study by Sorrells et al in Nature challenges the existence of adult neurogenesis in humans and suggests that it may have been assumed based on studies in rats and other mammals.
- This implies that many of the claims made about the importance of adult neurogenesis in humans may have been overstated or erroneous, and that scientists need to re-evaluate their understanding of the brain.
- The discovery of neurogenesis and neural stem cells in the adult brain challenged a century-old dogma in neuroscience.
- The belief that no new neurons could be generated in the adult brain was deeply entrenched in the Neuroscience community.
- Because of the previous dogma, it can be said that efforts to affirm neurogenesis in humans were not given enough effort.

Key learnings:
- Although adult neurogenesis was discovered in rats, it has been widely assumed to occur in humans and other mammals as well based on limited evidence.
- Many studies have linked adult neurogenesis to various brain functions and disorders, but some of these claims may not be valid if adult neurogenesis is rare or absent in humans.
- Studies that rely on animal models to investigate human brain processes should be approached with caution and skepticism.
- The acceptance of adult neurogenesis may be part of a contemporary paradigm shift in our view of the plasticity and stability of the adult brain.
- We should always be ready for disappointment to avoid dogmatism.

Key questions:
- How did the assumption that adult neurogenesis occurs in humans become so widespread and influential in neuroscience research?
- What are the implications of the Sorrells et al study for our understanding of brain functions and disorders, and for developing treatments for them?
- How can scientists improve their methods and standards to avoid similar cases of mistaken assumptions and overgeneralizations in the future?
- Is it possible that the reaction to the previous dogma contributed to the effort to affirm neurogenesis in humans?
- What other theories exist around adult neurogenesis?

# OT99: Alpine Thread
*April 9, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/04/09/ot99-alpine-thread/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The rationalist community now has a community center at La Renaissance Cafe in Berkeley managed by Sarah and in need of financial assistance.
- The author may move SSC meetups to the community center.

Key learnings:
- There is a new study arguing that adult human neurogenesis does exist after all, which contradicts a previous study cited in a post.
- Science in certain fields may have flimsy foundations and should be approached with caution.

Key questions:
- How can people assist with the financial needs of the community center?
- How can the contradictory studies on adult human neurogenesis be reconciled?

# Why DC’s Low Graduation Rates?
*April 10, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/04/10/why-dcs-low-graduation-rates/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Graduation rates in DC are expected to drop from 73% to 42%, showing that the previous rate was fraudulent.
- Despite being a national education model, DC is doing abysmally bad in terms of education performance, especially among black students.
- Hypotheses suggested for the decline include having a terrible school system, having an unusually disadvantaged population or setting higher standards compared to others.
- The graph showing DC's exam scores versus graduation rates reveals that while the previously reported rate clustered with everyone else, the actual rate is an outlier.
- The author argues that other cities with high poverty and segregation levels might also maintain high graduation rates through fraud and low standards.

Key learnings
- DC's education system is worse than anticipated, especially considering the previously reported graduation rate, which was inflated by fraud.
- DC's challenging racial makeup and poverty levels do not explain the massive drop in graduation rate.
- The graph suggests that DC has significantly stricter standards than any other state in terms of the relationship between exam scores and graduation rate.
- There is a possibility of fraud and low standards in other school districts with similar conditions.

Key questions
- How is DC's white student population faring significantly better than its black population?
- Was the inflated graduation rate rate across other states due to fraud and low standards too?
- Could DC's stricter standards actually be benefiting the students despite the catastrophic drop in graduation rates?
- Can the school officials find a way to allow the 19% of these moderately-off-track students to graduate and increase the graduation rate?

# Recommendations vs. Guidelines
*April 12, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/04/12/recommendations-vs-guidelines/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Medicine uses guidelines to provide recommendations for treatment.
- Guidelines include more than one recommendation and specific criteria for success or failure.
- Guidelines acknowledge that everyone is different and may need more than one recommendation.
- Guidelines contain information about correlations and anti-correlations.

Key learnings:
- Guidelines provide valuable information about a field and can help tailor recommendations to specific circumstances.
- Once someone understands a field well, they can create their own personal guidelines.
- Making guidelines can be risky but they provide valuable help in fields like dieting and nootropics, where there aren't many guidelines.

Key questions:
- Why don't people who have more knowledge of nutrition make dieting guidelines?
- Why aren't there more guidelines in fields like nootropics and self-help?
- Does making guidelines seem like a claim to knowledge that people are afraid to make?

# Highlights From The Comments On DC Graduation Rates
*April 12, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/04/12/highlights-from-the-comments-on-dc-graduation-rates/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Unexcused absences are major contributors to the low graduation rates in DC Public Schools.
- The attendance policy is being strictly enforced now, resulting in a drop in expected graduates.
- DCPS has an 80/20 rule, with most schools having five periods.
- 10 or more unexcused absences in a class automatically results in an F for the term.
- Students are over 15 mins late for class often, which counts as an unexcused absence.
- Poor households make it difficult for students to attend school, especially if they have younger siblings.
- Students in single-parent households are responsible for ensuring younger siblings attend school.
- The attendance policy's severity puts poor children at a disadvantage and disproportionately affects black students' graduation rates.

Key learnings:
- Strict enforcement of the attendance policy negatively impacts the attendance rates of poor students.
- Poor communities struggle with the attendance policy due to social factors such as single-parent households.

Key questions:
- What other policies contribute to DC Public Schools' low graduation rates?
- How can schools minimize absenteeism while considering the unique circumstances of disadvantaged students?
- What can the federal government do to improve public schools' quality, particularly those in low-income areas?

# SSC Survey Results: Sexual Harassment Levels By Field
*April 17, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/04/17/ssc-survey-results-sexual-harassment-levels-by-field/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- There is little credible research on how rates of sexual harassment differ by occupation type.
- The variation in survey results of sexual harassment rates appears to be dependent on how questions are asked.
- Investigations are needed that use the same methodology across multiple fields.
- The narrative of women being driven out of technology due to harassment by men is not supported by data.
- The rate at which men and women choose tech courses in high school parallels the rate at which they go into tech occupations.
- Gender balance in fields is not predicted by harassment levels in those fields.

Key learnings:
- STEM and male-dominated fields have the least harassment rates.
- Industries that rank low in EEOC data tend to be small industries with very few women.
- Respondents to the Slate Star Codex survey reported much more sexual harassment outside of work than in it.
- Narrative and anecdotal evidence should not be considered as reliable as scientific evidence.
- It is important to be skeptical of experiments that confirm an unusual opinion until they are verified by other sources.
- Raw survey data should be made available to the public to encourage replication of conclusions.

Key questions:
- Why do numbers of sexual harassment differ so dramatically in surveys, and what is the most important issue?
- Is media coverage of high-profile industries in terms of sexual harassment mistargeted?
- How do we reconcile the media's claims that STEM fields are uniquely unwelcoming to women with the data that shows they have lower harassment rates?
- How can we encourage more good research to be done on the topic of gender imbalance in technology and other fields?
- What other narratives or anecdotal evidence about gender imbalance should we be skeptical of until they are supported by scientific evidence?
- How can we effectively communicate the importance of scientific evidence in shaping our understanding of social issues?

# Highlights From The Comments On Survey Harassment Rates
*April 18, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/04/18/highlights-from-the-comments-on-survey-harassment-rates/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Brymic attempted to reproduce the results of SSC Survey Results but couldn't reproduce the correlations between female victimization, male victimization and male perpetration.
- Chris quotes a TIME article that argues that communities with oversupply of women have higher rates of sexual assault than communities with oversupply of men.
- Discussions included the misrepresentation of harassment being in all technology companies instead of only in startups, theorizing whether sexual aggression is a result of being introverted or extroverted, and other factors that may affect sexual harassment in the survey.

Key learnings:
- The correlation between female victimization at work and outside work and that of males suggests a strong 'people in fields' effect without the need for the combination score.
- Elevated rates of sexual harassment are a predictable feature of communities with oversupplies of women.
- Brymic's findings could not be reproduced which means the data needs further analysis.

Key questions:
- Can we trust the misrepresentation of harassment in all technology companies instead of startups?
- What factors impact sexual harassment rates, and how do they interact?
- Is there further exploration that needs to be done to validate or invalidate the SSC Survey Results?

# Gupta On Enlightenment
*April 19, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/04/19/gupta-on-enlightenment/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Gupta and MCTB propose similar things about meditation and enlightenment
- Everyone sees something different when exploring cosmic forces beyond enlightenment
- Enlightenment is something in the brain that goes through the normal perceptual process
- Lowering the mental background noise requires going through all emotional layers and attachments that generate thought
- Getting enlightened takes as much work as a PhD
- Meditation can lead to a complete stop of internal dialogue
- Western society doesn't promote or encourage the practice of meditation
- Psychologists and psychiatrists rarely encounter patients having mystical experiences due to meditation

Key learnings:
- Enlightenment is something unique to each individual's perspective
- The brain's capacity for reasoning is much lower than vision and even pain perception
- Meditation and enlightenment can take a long time to achieve
- Enlightenment changes one's perception of reality, but not necessarily their outward behavior
- The Western and Eastern mystical traditions may not necessarily align in beliefs and practices
- Meditation can lead to unexpected and spiritual experiences
- One should be cautious and informed before starting a meditation practice

Key questions:
- Should we trust individual perspectives of enlightenment or strive to find a universal truth?
- How does the brain process enlightenment differently than other perceptions?
- How can we reconcile conflicting beliefs and practices between Western and Eastern mystical traditions?
- What can be done to educate people about the potential effects of meditation?
- How can a balance between mental health and spiritual experiences be achieved for those practicing meditation?

# Book Review: History Of The Fabian Society
*April 30, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/04/30/book-review-history-of-the-fabian-society/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The Fabian Society was a British socialist organization that advocated for democratic socialism and incremental change.
- The Society was founded by a group of upper-middle-class bureaucrats who believed that communism should avoid talk of violent revolution and instead work within the system.
- The Fabians educated people through lectures, debates, and well-written pamphlets, which were a core part of their strategy.
- The Society's success is evidenced by the fact that their demands for public policies are similar to those found in modern democracies.
- The Fabian Society was successful despite not being particularly competent or hard-working.
- Its success can be attributed to luck, having a group of talented leaders, being bourgeois, accepting its role as a middle-class socialist society, and being a "big tent" organization.
- The Society's focus on intellectual freedom and its ability to look respectable were also assets.
- The Fabian Society was successful in cultivating socialist talent and promoting socialist ideas.
- Their long-term outlook and gradual approach helped to attract and retain members.
- Personal relationships were emphasized through social events and gatherings.
- There was a widespread belief in the inevitability of socialism during the time of the Fabians.

Key learnings:
- The Fabians' success can be attributed to their focus on incremental change and reformation rather than violent revolution.
- The Society's emphasis on education, talent cultivation, and well-written propaganda contributed to their influence and success.
- Success can come in unexpected ways, even without overt effort.
- Luck and talented individuals can play a big role in success.
- Being able to move in different social circles and knowing how to work within them can be advantageous.
- A soft touch and intellectual atmosphere can be effective in attracting and retaining members.
- Personal relationships are important and can be cultivated through social events and gatherings.
- Success can come from being in the right place at the right time and having widespread support for the ideas being promoted.

Key questions:
- How did the Fabians' principles and strategies differ from those of other socialist organizations of their time?
- What impact did the Fabians have on British and global politics beyond the policies they advocated for?
- How important is luck in achieving success?
- Can a lack of overt effort still lead to success?
- How much do social status and networks impact success?
- To what extent were the Fabians' strategies responsible for their success?
- How did the Fabians' strategies compare to those of modern nonprofits?
- How did the historical context of the time contribute to the acceptance of socialist ideas?

# Varieties Of Argumentative Experience
*May 8, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/05/08/varieties-of-argumentative-experience/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Paul Graham's hierarchy is useful for determining types of responses, not types of disagreements.
- Disagreements can be classified into meta-debates, social shaming, facts/gotchas, single studies, and good-faith surveys of evidence.
- Isolated demands for rigor are unreasonable requests for perfect evidence, often to dismiss common-sense statements.
- Disagreements can arise from different levels of argumentation, including factual disagreements, moral disagreements, and high-level generators of disagreement.
- Isolated demands for rigor and disputing definitions can derail arguments and should be handled carefully.
- Clarification and operationalization can help to focus arguments and find common ground.
- Many arguments never go beyond a certain level of depth
- Going through the whole process of arguing can help to produce respect between opposing sides
- The natural tendency is to assume the other side is ignorant or biased, but this may not always be the case
- The process of arguing can shift the perceptions of prior beliefs

Key learnings:
- Disagreements can range from unproductive meta-debates to more productive discussions of evidence.
- Attempting to shame someone over social media is not likely to win over the opposition.
- Scientific studies are not always reliable, and both sides of an argument often have studies supporting their claims.
- Good-faith surveys of evidence require consideration of opposing viewpoints and an understanding of the limitations of scientific studies.
- Arguments can often become unproductive when they get bogged down in low-level disagreements or high-level generators of disagreement.
- Double-cruxing is a useful technique for operationalizing arguments and finding common ground.
- Good communication skills, trust, and respect are needed to navigate disagreements successfully.
- Arguing can produce respect for the other person even if it doesn't result in agreement
- Bias and ignorance can exist on both sides of an argument
- The process of arguing can shift perceptions of prior beliefs

Key questions:
- What are the limitations of studies and the scientific consensus in determining the truth of complex issues?
- How can we engage in good-faith discussions about politics on social media?
- What are the most productive ways to move beyond meta-debates and shaming towards discussions of evidence and potential solutions?
- Have I been using isolated demands for rigor or disputing definitions in my arguments?
- How can I operationalize my arguments to find common ground with my opponent?
- What high-level generators of disagreement might be underlying my disagreements with others?
- Why do arguments often fail to go beyond a certain level of depth?
- How can we ensure that we are respecting the other side during a debate?
- Can perceptions of prior beliefs be changed through the argumentative process?

# Basic Income, Not Basic Jobs: Against Hijacking Utopia
*May 16, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/05/16/basic-income-not-basic-jobs-against-hijacking-utopia/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Some Democrats are proposing a basic jobs guarantee, which promises a job to anyone who wants one.
- Basic jobs have been compared to basic income, suggesting that they feel "fairer" and provide a psychological boost, and can be used to do useful projects.
- The author is against the basic jobs proposal, arguing that it has practical shortcomings and doesn't help everyone.
- The population that depends on basic jobs will be disproportionately composed of people who don't fit into the regular workforce.
- A basic job guarantee doesn't mean free labor.
- Nobody has a good plan for how basic jobs would replace firing bad workers or how to deal with abusive working conditions, etc.
- Basic income could fix private industry; basic jobs could destroy it.
- Basic income supports personal development; basic jobs prevent it.
- Basic income solves the problems of inadequate welfare, limited runway for entrepreneurs, and limited job search time for the poor.
- Basic jobs do not solve these problems and maintain the poor-vs-the-rest-of-us dichotomy.
- Work is often miserable, and basic jobs will likely result in similarly miserable conditions if cost constraints are involved.
- Basic income avoids the issues of a dichotomy and offers everyone the same baseline income.
- Capitalism and private industry can be awful, and basic income offers a chance to do better without destroying everything.
- Basic income should be pursued despite the challenge of larger-scale testing.
- The assumption that money is the primary issue with poverty is not supported by data.
- Poor people today who make $10,000 or $20,000 are often unhappy because they have real money-related problems.
- Rent being too high is one of the biggest societal ills.
- Basic income gives freedom while basic jobs only offer money that most likely won't be enough.
- Meaningful aspects of life like social responsibility or sense of purpose are also needed, not just money.
- Basic income may make opioid crisis worse while basic jobs have a chance of improving it.
- Giving people the opportunity to work, instead of forcing them into work, could improve instances of finding purpose.
- There are examples of whole classes, like aristocrats, who have managed to live off others' work and have been happy.
- Self-employed people tend to be happier than those who are other-employed.
- The argument for basic jobs revolves around the idea that work is necessary for human flourishing and that people are not sufficiently self-aware to realize that.
- A basic income would make it easier for people to get what they want, i.e. leisure activities or working.
- Basic jobs could be used to create useful infrastructure, while also fostering local economies, provided the government subsidizes the workers so that their goods can be competitive.
- Capitalism seems to have historically worked pretty well and a basic jobs guarantee preserves the best features of capitalism.
- Basic jobs could get so entrenched that the system cannot move on to something better.
- Basic income offers a chance at a utopia while basic jobs perpetuate the worst parts of the current system.
- Scott is comparing the most utopian formulation of basic income to a practical version of basic jobs.
- Basic jobs are better than nothing but not by much.

Key learnings:
- Basic jobs do not help disabled individuals, caregivers, and parents.
- Basic jobs can perpetuate poverty by not helping people with the cost of housing and transportation.
- Basic jobs may not pay for themselves if there are concerns about the quality of work and employees.
- Basic income avoids the problems with basic jobs, such as bad workplaces and abusive working conditions.
- Basic income provides opportunities for personal development and learning new skills.
- Basic jobs could have a negative effect on private industry and could prevent personal development.
- Basic income provides unlimited runway for entrepreneurs and more freedom for those in between jobs.
- Basic income avoids the dichotomy between welfare recipients and everyone else.
- Basic jobs are unlikely to avoid the same issues as private industry, and the cost constraints may result in miserable working conditions.
- Poverty problems aren't just about money and need other reforms.
- A basic job is not the best alternative to basic income.
- Basic income offers more than what basic jobs can provide.
- Sense of purpose is need, but having a job isn't always the best way to receive it.
- The mere act of having free time should not be seen as negative but as an opportunity.
- Unemployment is related to contingent features that make people unhappy, such as stigma, social pressure, pre-existing problems, disabilities or chronic pain, and not necessarily with work being necessary for human flourishing.
- The best studies on homemakers suggest that women who want to be homemakers are happier as homemakers and sadder if forced to work, and that women who want to work are happier as workers and sadder if forced to stay at home.
- There are some people who are happiest working, and others who are happiest pursuing leisure activities, and a basic income would make it easier for both groups to get what they want.
- Basic income offers a chance for a more ideal society while basic jobs only maintain the status quo.
- It is essential to compare different versions of basic income and basic jobs to understand their advantages and limitations.
- The comparison between basic income and basic jobs needs to consider their practical implications and how they can impact society.

Key questions:
- How can the disability application process be improved?
- Can a basic jobs program address the needs of caregivers and parents?
- How can basic jobs contribute to perpetuating poverty among low-income individuals?
- How do you deal with people who don't fit into the regular workforce?
- What's the plan for firing bad workers?
- How do you replace exit rights in situations where people can't change jobs?
- How do you prevent basic jobs from destroying private industry?
- How can you balance the needs of basic jobs with personal development opportunities?
- What are the drawbacks of pursuing a basic income system on a larger scale?
- How can basic income be implemented to address the needs of those requiring more than the baseline income?
- Can basic income replace and offer a better alternative to existing social programs like welfare?
- Is it fair to assume that "the forgotten man" in Economic Policy is a millionaire, rather than a person who has lost his job or has low wages?
- How could the real political problems of housing be solved before implementing UBI?
- Could a basic job provide the social responsibilities and sense of purpose that people need?
- Are "non cost-disease-related parts of poverty" able to be resolved before addressing the cost-disease issue?
- Is giving someone no-strings-attached money, like basic income, going to be an issue for those who are suffering from addiction or a loss of hope?
- What if people prefer leisure to paid work?
- What if basic jobs become entrenched and prevent future progress?
- How can society maintain the positive effects of capitalism while at the same time creating useful infrastructure?
- Can basic jobs and capitalism coexist?
- What would be the most effective way to implement basic income or basic jobs?
- What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of each approach, and which one is better suited to addressing the challenges we face?
- How can we ensure that discussions about basic income and basic jobs involve a more comprehensive analysis of their implications for society?

# Can Things Be Both Popular And Silenced?
*May 23, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/05/23/can-things-be-both-popular-and-silenced/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The term "intellectual dark web" is fraught and combines both careful and important thinkers with awful demagogues.
- Several articles question whether the movement can claim to be silenced if its members are actually popular.
- The movement's spokespeople are well-known and successful, but they still claim to be marginalized.
- The conversation around the intellectual dark web fails to acknowledge the success of the internet in enabling uncensorable communication and the emergence of a third route between left and right media platforms.
- The experiences of the IDW suggest some degree of silencing, and dismissing these claims as an entitlement to universal agreement overlooks the specific incidents of exclusion, harassment, and danger they report.
- The IDW may unknowingly self-censor their ideas on edgier subjects because discussing them publicly can lower their reputation and put them at greater personal risk.
- Many criticisms of the IDW by people in media and academia misunderstand the concept of silencing, mistaking popularity and discussion for freedom to express without negative consequences.
- Silencing refers to a situation where a movement has lots of supporters but none will admit to it publicly under their real name, and its ideas don't penetrate to anywhere they might actually have power.
- Common knowledge is key to society, and even if everyone knows something, if it's not common knowledge, anyone who says it is knowingly assuming a massive personal risk.
- To prevent something from becoming common knowledge, all you need to do is censor the common-knowledge-producing mechanisms: the press, the Internet, public meetings.
- Social censorship isn’t about your support or your leaders. It’s about creating systems of common knowledge that favor your side and handicap your opponents.

Key learnings:
- Groups that are popular and have famous spokespeople can still experience silencing and marginalization.
- More taboo ideologies can generate more celebrity, despite having fewer advocates than orthodox ideologies.
- Famous people who espouse taboo views can help launder them while avoiding repercussions, while ordinary people still face social stigmas.
- The success of the internet for decentralising communication and funding has allowed more marginal voices to be heard and gain support.
- Risk of exclusion, harassment, and danger are real outcomes of expressing edgy, taboo, or unpopular views publicly, and their occurrence does not reflect an overblown sense of entitlement to universal agreement.
- Acknowledging uncomfortable ideas carries reputational risks that the IDW may avoid, and can create obstacles to actually engaging in rational debate.
- Censorship equals support divided by the common knowledge of support.
- Assessing how convinced people are of a specific viewpoint is harder than it looks.
- It's necessary to build common knowledge of everyone's convictions.

Key questions:
- Can a movement claim to be silenced if its members are popular and well-known?
- Do taboo ideologies generate more celebrity and attention than orthodox ideologies?
- Can famous people who advocate for taboo views launder them while avoiding social consequences that ordinary people still face?
- How can a culture strike a balance between valuing free speech and safeguarding individuals from verbal or physical harassment and persecution?
- What are the long-run implications of having more polarised media platforms, rather than compromise-seeking platforms?
- Are there ways to incentivise people to engage in more rational debate that don't expose them to an undue level of reputation risk?
- How can we prevent silencing from happening to movements with a lot of supporters but low common knowledge?
- What steps can be taken to ensure common knowledge in a society?
- How can we accurately assess the degree of support for a specific viewpoint in a society?

# Should Psychiatry Test For Lead More?
*May 23, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/05/23/should-psychiatry-test-for-lead-more/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Lead poisoning can cause psychiatric symptoms, including depression
- Psychiatry has historically not considered lead poisoning as a possible cause for psychiatric conditions
- Psychiatrists do not regularly test for lead poisoning in patients
- There is little evidence to guide psychiatrists in whether or not to test for lead poisoning in patients with depression
- Medical evidence does not support using chelation therapy for depression.
- Doctors don't have a plan for acting on results of high-average lead levels in patients.
- There are many plausible causes of depression without a clear action plan for diagnosis or treatment.
- Doctors must choose between following established guidelines, jumping on board with new ideas without clear evidence, or coming up with their own big idea to propose.

Key learnings:
- Lead exposure is heavily linked to poverty, making it difficult to separate the effects of lead poisoning from other factors
- There is only one study investigating the link between lead and depression
- It is not clear how much of an impact lead has on depression rates
- Testing for lead exposure is not a standard practice for diagnosing depression.
- Not all medical conditions are relevant to consider in cases of depression.
- Doctor's must consider whether new ideas are worth pursuing when the medical evidence is unclear.

Key questions:
- Why doesn't psychiatry regularly test for lead poisoning in patients with depression?
- How important is lead exposure compared to other environmental and genetic factors in causing depression?
- What is the best way for psychiatrists to approach testing for potential environmental causes of depression while considering the cost and patient experience?
- What is the appropriate action plan for diagnosing and treating patients with high lead levels?
- Is it necessary for doctors to consider each of the many possible causes of depression?
- How should doctors approach new ideas in the field of depression research when the evidence is unclear?

# Highlights From The Comments On Basic Jobs
*May 28, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/05/28/highlights-from-the-comments-on-basic-jobs/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Milton Friedman advocated for a negative income tax, which is more efficient and easier to administer than basic income.
- NIT has the logistical and political advantage of the existing system.
- Basic-jobs-like programs in Germany failed as companies replaced long-term unemployed people with new 1€-workers.
- Scandinavian countries have been utilizing activation policies which require those who apply for social assistance to work.
- There are societies where entire populations have been unconditionally emancipated from labor, but their idleness has aggravated their resentment against society.
- Amazon is competitive, but most surveys find job satisfaction is higher in the private sector than the public sector.
- Discussion of the feasibility and potential drawbacks of implementing a universal basic income (UBI)
- Comparison of UBI with a Basic Jobs Guarantee (BJG)
- Concerns about the rent market and landlords adjusting prices in response to UBI
- Suggestions for implementing a UBI that is funded by taxing the rich, but also acknowledging the limitations of any Utopian plan
- Universal Basic Income (UBI) is being debated as a solution to wealth inequality, but there are potential drawbacks that should be considered, such as increased healthcare costs.
- Another concern with UBI is how to balance payments to families and immigrants without creating unfair incentives or putting too much strain on the economy.
- Basic Jobs and UBI both have potential drawbacks, such as the risk of destroying private industry or creating a population that is unwilling to work.
- The issue of whether people will continue working even with UBI is debated.
- The author argues that being in a structured system, such as school or military, is beneficial.
- He offers a critique of the government's disability program and argues for private charity instead.
- The author is skeptical of the idea of basic income and believes it will lead to a lack of purpose and community.

Key learnings:
- Negative income tax (NIT) is more efficient and easier to administer than basic income.
- Job guarantee programs would be anticompetitive and there would be little to do with pointless busy work.
- A UBI could lead to people borrowing and spending all the money on interest.
- There are clear limitations and potential pitfalls inherent in any UBI program.
- Activation policies have been functionally similar to a Universal Basic Job (UBJ) guarantee.
- Any system for a UBI or BJG must address issues of political sustainability and incentives for work
- A UBI may be more universal in terms of who receives it, but a BJG may be more effective at screening out those who don't need it
- UBI presents an opportunity to incentivize industry to cater to those who currently cannot afford basic necessities
- Implementing UBI is a complex issue that involves balancing payments, healthcare costs, potential job loss, and incentives for workers.
- Starting with a small UBI program and monitoring its effects could help determine whether a larger program is feasible.
- The possibility of using UBI or other welfare programs to bribe voters must be taken into consideration in democratic societies.
- Being in a structured system can be beneficial for personal growth and development.
- The government's disability program may have flaws, and private charity could be a more effective solution.
- The concept of basic income may have negative consequences for a person's sense of purpose and community.

Key questions:
- What are the advantages of NIT over basic income and vice versa?
- How have other countries handled basic-jobs-like programs?
- What is the difference between a UBI and a UBJ?
- What effect does labor have on people's happiness and sense of purpose?
- How could people be prevented from borrowing against a UBI and spending it on interest?
- How can a UBI be funded sustainably and fairly, especially when considering regional cost-of-living differences?
- What incentives are needed to encourage those who can work to opt for a BJG, and can it replace current welfare programs such as unemployment benefits?
- How can the implementation of a UBI or BJG address concerns about the rent market and landlord behaviors?
- How can UBI payments be balanced to ensure that families and immigrants are treated fairly?
- Is there a risk that people will become too complacent with UBI and not work, or will the majority of people continue to work even with UBI?
- How can the potential costs of UBI, such as increased healthcare expenses, be managed effectively?
- How can we ensure that government programs for disadvantaged individuals are effective and efficient?
- What role should private charity play in supporting those in need?
- Is basic income a viable solution to poverty and inequality, or does it result in negative social impacts?

# In Search Of Missing US Suicides
*May 31, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/05/31/in-search-of-missing-us-suicides/

## Summary
Key ideas
- US states with high gun ownership have high suicide rates but not necessarily high homicide rates.
- Access to guns increases suicide rates.
- Suicide methods are not fungible but the US still has a relatively low suicide rate, which is an artefact of high gun availability.
- If the US had gun control similar to Britain, its suicide rate would be much lower.
- The US is religious, culturally similar to Britain, and ethnically diverse, which may be additional factors driving down its base rate of suicides.

Key learnings
- Restrictions on access to common means of suicide have led to lower suicide rates.
- Removing guns from a state does decrease its suicide rate.
- A gun-free US would have one of the lowest suicide rates in the developed world.

Key questions
- Why is there a clear relationship between gun ownership and suicide rates but not between gun ownership and homicide rates in the US?
- Why doesn't the US have a higher suicide rate given the high availability of guns? 
- How does the US' religious, cultural, and ethnic diversity contribute to its lower suicide rate?

# HPPD And The Specter Of Permanent Side Effects
*June 6, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/06/06/hppd-and-the-specter-of-permanent-side-effects/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD) is a real and uncommon disease caused by taking LSD and synthetic cannabinoids, with some people having it for years.
- Estimates of prevalence vary, with one of every four LSD users possibly susceptible to some form of HPPD, but it is also possible that most do not report it.
- HPPD and LSD trips share effects that can be explained by excitotoxicity or the killing of a few undetectably small but important neurons with gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABAergic) outputs on their cell bodies and terminals, respectively.
- There are several neurochemical hypotheses to explain the development of tardive dyskinesia, including the role of dopamine and cholinergic systems, noradrenergic dysfunction, dysfunctions of striatonigral, GABAergic neurons, and excitotoxicity.
- In some cases, drug side effects resulting from the body as a chaotic system that settles into various attractors that persist until something shifts it can be more dangerous than killing-off-neurons hypotheses.

Key learnings
- LSD can cause HPPD, a real and uncommon disease that can affect perception and generate anxiety attacks lasting years.
- Some other drugs can have permanent side effects despite having only limited exposure times, and different hypotheses exist to explain how they generate these outcomes.
- As the mechanisms behind the permanence of these drugs' side effects remain unclear, they perpetuate an aura of unpredictability, stressing the importance of minimizing exposure and dosage and increasing awareness among users.

Key questions
- How common is HPPD among LSD users, and why doesn't it receive more attention?
- What are the potential mechanisms that explain why LSD and other drugs have permanent side effects despite modest drug exposure times?
- How can we minimize the risk of these drugs' severe side effects and increase public awareness of them?

# Contra Caplan On Arbitrary Deploring
*June 19, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/06/19/contra-caplan-on-arbitrary-deploring/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- People tend to get upset over the violation of already-settled bright-line norms because they want to use limited enforcement resources efficiently.
- The international community made a credible commitment to punish chemical weapons use, and it's worked so far.
- A fixed amount of public outrage per news cycle is the same kind of “limited enforcement resource” as only having ten police officers; commit to using it to disproportionately enforce existing taboos, and you’ll have more of it left over later on.

Key learnings:
- Prioritizing responding to violations of established norms could help to enforce these norms more effectively in the future.
- Credible commitments to enforce norms can deter individuals from violating them.

Key questions:
- Why do people tend to get upset over the violation of already-settled bright-line norms?
- What are some examples of established norms and bright-line rules?
- How can societies solidify norms and enforce strong commitments to them?

# The GATTACA Trilogy
*June 19, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/06/19/the-gattaca-trilogy/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The 1997 film GATTACA was actually the first film in a three-movie trilogy, with the last two directed by Moira LeQuivalence being flops that are hard to find.
- Epigenetics is the new method used to select top individuals for space programs based on the stress their ancestors faced.
- Vincent fakes his epigenome to fit in and pass as a strong astronaut candidate.
- Vincent's moral compass leads him to call out the corrupt company's practices.
- Vincent faked his degree to become an astronaut.
- An incident causes a detective, who is also Vincent's brother, to interview him.
- Vincent admits to the fraud to his brother and the detective clears him of the suspicions.
- Vincent realizes his desire to be an astronaut was to escape the stigmas surrounding his secondary education degree.

Key learnings:
- The danger of genetic and epigenetic determinism and the unfairness of using discriminatory methods to determine one's worth.
- The importance of individuality and the ability for people to define themselves beyond their genetic makeup and background.
- The significance of facing one's own moral compass, calling out unethical practices, and fighting for an equal society.
- Success goes beyond formal education.
- Lying to achieve a goal doesn't pay off in the end.
- Forgiveness and family bonds can overcome difficult situations.

Key questions:

# Cost Disease In Medicine: The Practical Perspective
*June 20, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/06/20/cost-disease-in-medicine-the-practical-perspective/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Cheap-O Psychiatry is a theoretical, highly affordable online mental health practice with a self-explanatory name and a focus on delivering efficient and effective treatment to patients at a fraction of the normal cost. 
- The practice makes its clinicians available for 15-minute Skype consultations in lieu of costlier, in-person visits, but provides a comprehensive collection of self-help resources on topics like sleep habits, nutrition, and CBT therapy on its website. 

Key learnings
- Cheap-O Psychiatry suggests that affordable healthcare delivery is possible, even within the current, deeply faulted system that frequently places heavy financial burdens on patients. 
- To achieve this goal, practices need to be lean, efficient, and meticulous about avoiding unnecessary expenses, while also maintaining the highest standards of clinical care quality. 

Key questions
- Why is high-quality affordable healthcare so rare and elusive, and what would it take to alter the industry in a way that made it more widely accessible to patients anywhere in America? 
- If entrepreneurs like the author created more experiments like Cheap-O Psychiatry, where do they go from here? What are the next steps?

# Book Review: Capital In The Twenty-First Century
*June 24, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/06/24/book-review-capital-in-the-twenty-first-century/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Piketty's book is about quantitative macroeconomic history and provides a theory of very-long-term forces at work in economic change.
- Normal economic growth has always been between 1% and 1.5% per year, which encompasses almost every big question in politics and economics.
- Piketty's model of the 20th century history brings out the impact of the two World Wars on economies.
- Rentiers' yearly incomes should always be pushing further and further ahead of laborers', and inequality should always increase during ordinary times.
- Rentiers, who live off of their inherited wealth, risk losing everything during times of crisis.
- High taxes and a large middle class are factors that have helped prevent the reemergence of a rentier society.
- Income inequality, particularly among executives of major corporations, is on the rise.
- A global tax on wealth is needed to prevent the rebirth of a rentier society.
- Policies that reduce rentier power, such as reducing rent and debt, may also be helpful.
- The book "Capital in the Twenty-First Century" offers interesting insights into wealth inequality and its history.
- Themes in the book include the forces driving inequality, and why inequality is not an automatic result of capitalist societies.
- There are mechanisms which can address inequality, including wealth taxes and inheritance taxes.

Key learnings:
- Population growth, temporary bubbles, and catch-up growth are anomalies that create economic growth rates outside the normal rate.
- Rentiers are people who live off the interest on savings instead of working, and their money grows as the rate of return on capital increases.
- The rate of return on capital has always averaged about 4-5%, while GDP per capita growth rate is about 1-1.5% per year.
- During crises, rentiers can lose all their money, while laborers have more opportunities to rebuild their income.
- Although income inequality is high, economies continue to grow at a steady rate.
- Catch-up growth may help reduce inequality between nations.
- Reading "Capital in the Twenty-First Century" makes the actions of individuals seem small and suggests leverage points for change.
- The book offers good explanations of all the other factors that contribute to inequality and what would happen if each one was changed.
- Political will is needed to make changes to address inequality.

Key questions:
- How do Piketty's theories about quantitative macroeconomic history apply to today's economic climate?
- Is there a way to address the persistent income inequality caused by the growth of rentiers' yearly incomes?
- How can we encourage normal economic growth rates without relying on anomalies like population growth, temporary bubbles, and catch-up growth?
- Why haven't rentiers made a comeback since World War II?
- How can we address income inequality among laborers?
- What policies can specifically target the rentier class?
- What are the criticisms of Piketty's claims on inequality?
- Can we see how much people like hereditary rent-seeking, and would getting rid of that create a better rallying cry?
- Would "everyone productive vs the idle rich" make for less toxic politics than "people who earn more vs. people who earn less"?

# List Of Passages I Highlighted In My Copy Of Capital In The Twenty-First Century
*June 26, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/06/26/list-of-passages-i-highlighted-in-my-copy-of-capital-in-the-twenty-first-century/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Ricardo's concern was the long-term evolution of land prices and land rents, and argued for a steadily increasing tax on land rents.
- Marx based his work on an analysis of the internal logical contradictions of the capitalist system and the principle of scarcity as the basis of a more thorough analysis of the dynamics of capitalism.
- Kuznets' sharp reduction in income inequality in the United States between 1913 and 1948 had an enormous impact on economic debate.
- Piketty's fundamental inequality, r > g, sums up the overall logic of his conclusions.
- Piketty argues that colonialism was partly a form of capitalism with profits going to foreign shareholders.
- Capitalism produces an eternal negative action, with British investment in Africa leading to the country being drained of money forever.
- In the 18th and 19th centuries, novels were frank about money, reflecting the stability of the economy at the time.
- The middle class often lived off government bonds during the napoleonic wars, creating a class of bond tycoons whose wealth was preserved for generations.
- Inheritance law based on the principle of equal division of property among siblings provides equality and economic efficiency, and enables the free circulation of goods.
- The decline in government receipts in the poorest countries in the 1980s-1990s was largely due to a decrease in custom duties brought in revenue equivalent to about 5% of national income in the 1970s.
- The optimal top tax rate in developed countries is likely above 80%.
- Public debt could be reduced to zero by privatizing all public assets
- Government going into debt to create government services is similar in ways to privatizing those services
- Interest payments on public debt weigh just as heavily on the public exchequer as rent
- Extreme inequality of wealth is almost a condition of civilization

Key learnings:
- Good data is important for economic analysis, but it is not always complete or representative of future trends.
- Durable technological progress and steadily increasing productivity can serve as a counterweight to the process of accumulation and concentration of private capital.
- Inherited wealth grows faster than output and income when the rate of return on capital significantly exceeds the growth rate of the economy.
- The demographics of a country play a crucial role in the dynamics and structure of inequality.
- The stability of an economy affects how frank people are about money, and this has implications for culture and literature.
- Inheritance laws and their enforcement can have implications for social mobility and the concentration of wealth.
- Trade liberalization can have unintended consequences for developing countries, and lost revenue should be gradually replaced by other revenue sources.
- Taxes on the rich can serve as a more liberal means of limiting inequality, and were effective in reducing inequality during their existence.
- European social state must continue to own public assets to fulfill its mission
- Small elite could concern themselves with something other than subsistence only because of extreme inequality of wealth

Key questions:
- Why did Ricardo's prediction of rising land rents fail to materialize?
- Why did Marx's prediction of an apocalyptic end to capitalism fail to materialize?
- How recent is the idea of "economic growth" and why did 19th- and 20th-century economists fail to understand it?
- What is the impact of colonialism on capitalism?
- Why did novelists of the 18th and 19th centuries go into so much detail about finances?
- Why did the rate of return on government bonds change?
- What was the logic behind enshrining the principle of equal division of property among siblings into law?
- Which factors determine the optimal top tax rate in developed countries?
- What are the overall long-term effects of trade liberalization on developing countries?
- How can public debt be reduced to zero without privatizing public assets?
- What is Piketty's position on debt and how is it nuanced?
- Is extreme inequality necessary for civilization to exist?

# Highlights From The Comments On Piketty
*June 28, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/06/28/highlights-from-the-comments-on-piketty/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Matt Rognlie claimed that Piketty did not correctly account for capital depreciation in his calculations.
- Housing is a real source of inequality, but not all homeowners are rentiers.
- Private equity funds are a way that super rich people can have higher returns on their investments, but there are risks involved.
- The measurement problems in Piketty-Saez's income distribution statistics invalidate his larger prescriptive argument in favor of highly progressive tax rates.
- Piketty's claim that the rising rentier class will dominate the 21st century doesn't hold up.
- There is significant academic debate over Piketty's empirical data.
- The claim that the super-rich get much better returns on investment than everyone else doesn't really hold up.
- Piketty's rules of thumb for growth do not hold up well.

Key learnings:
- There are technical details that Piketty did not consider in his book, which Rognlie addressed in his paper.
- Different datasets provide different results regarding inequality measurements, and Piketty used the most dramatic ones in his book.
- Private equity funds are a way for super rich people to invest, but it involves significant risks, and not everyone is advised to invest in them.
- The increasing number of rentiers in a post-scarcity robot future is not necessarily bad.
- A wealth tax may not be an effective policy for inequality.

Key questions:
- Does Piketty's book really disprove his most shocking thesis?
- How do colleges with different amounts of endowment achieve higher returns on their investments?
- How can we account for changes in the tax codes when measuring income distributions?
- Did WWII have long-run positive effects on Europe's GDP, and why?
- Does Piketty provide a justification for the sharp discontinuity in his graph?
- Does Piketty's argument apply only to the US or also to Europe?
- Should we invest more in light of r>>g?
- Is anything from Piketty still worth keeping?

# SSC Journal Club: Dissolving The Fermi Paradox
*July 3, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/07/03/ssc-journal-club-dissolving-the-fermi-paradox/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Fermi Paradox asks why we see no evidence of alien civilizations despite the vastness of the universe
- Drake Equation calculates the probability of alien civilizations existing
- SDO's synthetic point estimate model accounts for parameter uncertainty and yields a probability of one in three for the existence of alien civilizations in our galaxy
- "Alternative genetic systems" could hinder the development of complex life on other planets

Key learnings:
- Relying solely on the mean of a probability distribution can be misleading
- What we're interested in is the distribution of probability over the number of alien civilizations
- The Drake Equation may not take into account parameter uncertainty

Key questions:
- Should we be relying on the Drake Equation to calculate the probability of alien civilizations existing?
- What are "alternative genetic systems" and how could they impact the development of life on other planets?
- Why did it take so long for someone to realize that the mean of the probability distribution isn't enough to draw conclusions about alien life?

# The Craft And The Codex
*July 5, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/07/05/the-craft-and-the-codex/

## Summary
Key ideas:

- The rationalist community was initially focused on developing rationality as a martial art or craft.
- There's a feeling that the community has made the least progress in improving the art of rationality itself.
- The art of rationality involves more practice than theory.
- Writing blog posts on hard or controversial topics can be viewed as the drudgery of rationality training and can be good practice for honing reflexes or generating heuristics.
- Through discussing hard or controversial topics and resolving confusions, important questions about the heuristics or generators of heuristics which are reliable in which situations can be made.

Key learnings:

- The value of discussing hard or controversial topics for rationality training.
- The importance of absorbing relevant results and refining intuitions about situations when science is trustworthy, or when heuristics are reliable in which situations.
- The importance of rationality practice, both as individual and community practice.

Key questions:

- What role does this blog play in the rationalist project?
- What heuristics or generators of heuristics are reliable in which situations?
- What are the best ways to refine intuitions about the situations when science is trustworthy or unreliable?

# Melatonin: Much More Than You Wanted To Know
*July 10, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/07/10/melatonin-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Melatonin is produced by the pineal gland and is lowest in the morning and highest at night, making you sleepier.
- Sleepiness is a combination of circadian rhythm and Process S, which regulates sleep/wake cycles.
- Melatonin works weakly as a hypnotic and strongly as a chronobiotic drug.
- Melatonin is effective but has a weaker effect than other sleep medications.
- The correct dose of melatonin is 0.3 mg.
- Circadian rhythm disorders are when your rhythm doesn't match the normal cycle, and melatonin can help regulate this.
- Melatonin is a hormone that regulates sleep-wake cycles.
- Melatonin usage varies depending on sleep disorders.
- The ideal dose of melatonin varies depending on the purpose.
- Melatonin can cause vivid dreams and cause sudden awakenings.

Key learnings:
- Melatonin is effective as a sleeping aid but has a weaker effect than other medications.
- The correct dose of melatonin is low, around 0.3 mg.
- Melatonin can help regulate circadian rhythm disorders.
- Melatonin can be used to treat sleep disorders and jet lag with specific protocols.
- Melatonin doesn't 'cure' conditions, and needs to be taken daily.
- Spectral content of light is important when discussing circadian rhythms.
- There is no clear explanation for why melatonin causes vivid dreams and wakefulness.

Key questions:
- Is melatonin an effective hypnotic?
- What is the right dose of melatonin?
- What are circadian rhythm disorders, and how do I use melatonin for them?
- What is the correct dose of melatonin to take for sleep disorders?
- Can melatonin be used to treat jet lag, and if so, how?
- What causes vivid dreams and sudden awakenings when taking melatonin?
- How strong is the relationship between circadian rhythm and depression?
- How do we choose the best melatonin supplement?

# Did A Melatonin Patent Inspire Current Dose Confusion?
*July 12, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/07/12/did-a-melatonin-patent-inspire-current-dose-confusion/

## Summary
Key ideas
- MIT patented the use of reasonable doses of melatonin up to 1 mg for promoting sleep
- The FDA did not regulate melatonin as its research showed it to be non-toxic even at extremely high doses
- Since the patent didn't cover other doses of melatonin, supplement manufacturers produced higher doses of melatonin, such as 3 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, etc.

Key learnings
- Supplement manufacturers started producing higher doses of melatonin to avoid paying royalties to MIT.
- Melatonin is labeled as a dietary supplement by the FDA, which does not require FDA regulation, even though it is a hormone.

Key questions
- Who would patent a drug only up to a certain dose?
- How much should one discount a compelling-sounding theory based on the bias of its inventor?
- How concerned should we be if a theory seems to violate efficient market assumptions?

# Fundamental Value Differences Are Not That Fundamental
*July 18, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/07/18/fundamental-value-differences-are-not-that-fundamental/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- There are at least two kinds of value disagreements.
- Differences in values are not binary but rather a spectrum.
- People do not have consistent values on all issues.
- The idea that groups of people are inherently different and cannot understand or debate each other is erroneous.
- People have more in common in their fundamental values than they realize.
- Fundamental values are not always expressed in clear binary divides or belong to a specific tribe.
- Using shame and indoctrination to settle value differences is not effective.
- Value differences are not necessarily a bad thing as they allow for diversity and healthy debate.
- Getting principles and using asymmetric weapons is a better approach to fighting for your values.

Key learnings:
- People's values can be inconsistent and may change depending on the political climate or convenience.
- Value differences do not necessarily make people fundamentally different or enemies.
- Understanding the spectrum of value differences helps facilitate compromise and avoid unnecessary conflicts.
- People share more fundamental values than they believe.
- Fundamental values are not expressed in clear tribal divides.
- Value differences are not necessarily a bad thing and should be embraced.
- Shaming and indoctrination are not effective tools for settling value differences.

Key questions:
- How do we distinguish between value disagreements caused by factual beliefs versus those caused by intrinsic value differences?
- How can we foster better understanding and dialogue between people who have seemingly opposing views?
- To what extent can our values be considered our own, and to what extent are they influenced by external factors?
- Is it possible to have any 100% fundamental value differences with someone else?
- Are weak and malleable value differences more common than fundamental ones?
- Is it possible to coexist with people who have different values than our own?
- What is the most effective approach to fighting for our values?

# The Whole City Is Center
*July 18, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/07/18/the-whole-city-is-center/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- People often assume value differences too quickly, but sometimes there are real, complicated value differences.
- Calling someone "lazy" can be problematic because it ignores potential psychological or biological issues that may be causing the lack of motivation.
- The term "lazy" can have different connotations for different people.
- The debate about punishment for crimes revolves around fundamental differences in values rather than facts.
- Even those who believe in punishment as a deterrent may prioritize the desire for criminals to suffer over effectiveness at reducing crime.
- The evolutionary/biochemical process may create urges to punish in people that are not necessarily in line with the goal of being just.
- Disagreements about punishment and other moral issues often boil down to differences in the choice of methods used to reach reflective equilibrium.
- People can have different factual beliefs on how to balance the information-bearing-content of words versus their potential connotations.
- Understanding this can help us be more understanding when dealing with others who have different beliefs.
- Different factual beliefs do not necessarily indicate fundamental value differences.

Key learnings:
- It's important to avoid making assumptions about someone's character based on a single behavior or trait.
- Finding the root cause of someone's lack of motivation can help provide effective solutions.
- The word "lazy" may have different meanings for different people, and it's important to clarify its usage in order to communicate effectively.
- There may be fundamental value differences between those who prioritize punishment for criminals and those who prioritize rehabilitation.
- Reflective equilibrium is important in considering moral values but can be difficult to achieve.
- The language used to describe values can shape perceptions and connotations.
- We should strive to understand the factual basis for others' beliefs, rather than assuming they have fundamentally different values.
- Practicing humility and empathy can help us avoid unnecessary conflict with others.

Key questions:
- Does laziness exist or is it just a moralistic judgment?
- How can we communicate the concept of someone being unmotivated without using a potentially harmful label like "lazy"?
- What is the appropriate way to respond to someone who is routinely unmotivated or unproductive?
- Is it ever justified to prioritize the desire for criminals to suffer over the goal of being just and reducing crime?
- How can we ensure reflective equilibrium when considering moral values?
- Can we ever truly know if a value difference is fundamental or just a result of differing methods of reflective equilibrium?
- How can we differentiate between factual differences and fundamental value differences in our interactions with others?
- In what ways can we be more empathetic and humble when dealing with people who have different beliefs than us?

# Value Differences As Differently Crystallized Metaphysical Heuristics
*July 24, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/07/24/value-differences-as-differently-crystallized-metaphysical-heuristics/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- We need to navigate complicated philosophical questions to decide how to act and model our values.
- Heuristics and approximations often serve as a simplified way to model values and behaviors.
- Value-differences stem from people operating at different levels of the ladder, from explicit modeling to metaphysical heuristics.
- The discovery of new, important dietary micronutrients is still possible, even with the improvement of nutritional fluids.
- The bioavailability of nutrients in Soylent compared to food is still unknown, and the absorption and bioavailability of micronutrients is still not fully understood.
- Crystallized heuristics and values are inevitable and play a role in decision-making, even if based on flawed or outdated reasoning.
- People who endorse values based on crystallized essences might misunderstand those who use explicit models, assuming they must not care about or prefer the opposite of the essences, when in reality they are working off a totally different system.
- The main mistake is people on both sides having moderately good understanding of how to do explicit causal models but accusing the other of being Neanderthals who only care about a crystallized-metaphysical-essence and have totally abandoned reason.
- Most metaphysical heuristics are a stand-in for something real, so we should expect blocs of allied people to contain some people who want the real thing, and other people who are running metaphysical heuristics that point at the thing.

Key learnings:
- Heuristics help simplify complex concepts for ordinary people, but can also be flawed.
- Explicit models can have their own flaws and limitations.
- Value-differences arise from different ways of modeling and understanding behaviors and their outcomes.
- The limitations of applying explicit models and focusing solely on utility.
- The importance of considering emotional experiences and cultural heuristics in decision-making.
- The influence of education, intelligence, and experiences on crystallization of heuristics.
- Avoid assuming that those with different values are inherently inferior or care less about consequences.
- Recognize that metaphysical heuristics are a stand-in for something real and that people may have varying degrees of attachment to them.

Key questions:
- How can we strike a balance between explicit modeling and metaphysical heuristics?
- What are the risks and benefits of relying on either one too heavily?
- How can we better understand and respect value-differences without becoming overly simplistic or dogmatic in our  own beliefs?
- How can we balance the benefits of explicit modeling with the limitations of utility-focused decision-making?
- Can we fully understand the absorption and bioavailability of micronutrients in synthetic food supplements, and how do they compare to those in natural foods?
- How do cultural heuristics and emotional experiences influence our values and decision-making?
- How can we better understand and communicate with those who have different values from our own?
- How can we avoid assuming the worst in others and instead seek common ground for discussion and debate?

- A new meta-analysis confirms that women in science deal with less sexual harassment than women in other fields.
- The Royal Game of Ur, the oldest board game in the world, was popular throughout the Near East and survived until the 1950s.
- The percentage of college degrees earned in humanities has dropped from 7.5% to 5% in the past ten years.
- The decrease in humanities degrees is possibly due to more people choosing degrees that are believed to provide better job opportunities.
- Marginal Revolution has published posts on topics such as educational attainment and migration patterns.
- There is a debate around whether or not President Trump should be viewed as a strategist or a clown.
- Ecuador is reportedly planning to hand over Julian Assange to the UK.

- Women in science deal with less sexual harassment than women in other fields.
- The Royal Game of Ur is the oldest board game in the world.
- The exodus from humanities programs has occurred continuously, even with an improving economy.
- Household income explains only 7% of the variance in educational attainment.
- Historians once believed certain old structures must have been built by gods or giants.

Key questions:

# Cancer Progress: Much More Than You Wanted To Know
*August 1, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/08/01/cancer-progress-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Official statistics suggest progress in the War on Cancer but skeptics offer a different view.
- Incidence rates for cancer have worsened since 1975 but age-adjusted death rates have improved since 1990.
- Improved social policies like discouraging smoking have been the primary reason for decreasing death rates.
- Five-year-survival rates have increased since 1970 but the improvement is confounded by improved screening.
- Adjusting for everything we know and are able to monitor, cancer survival rates seem to have increased.

Key learnings:
- Age-adjusted data shows that cancer death rates have been decreasing since 1990.
- Five-year-survival rates have been gradually improving since at least 1970, but improved screening confounds the improvement to some extent.
- Improved social policies like discouraging smoking have played a major role in decreasing death rates due to cancer.
- Researchers have investigated stage-specific survival rates to measure the effect of improved cancer treatment, and some gains in survival rates still remain even when adjusted for size.

Key questions:
- Which narrative is more accurate, official statistics or the view of skeptics?
- How much of the improvement in five-year survival rates can be attributed to improved screening?
- How effective have social policies like discouraging smoking been in decreasing death rates?
- How much of the gain in survival rates from improved cancer treatment is confounded by improved screening?
- Will future research reveal new confounders that take away the gains made in cancer treatment and diagnosis?

# Before You Get Too Excited About That Trigger Warning Study…
*August 6, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/08/06/before-you-get-too-excited-about-that-trigger-warning-study/

## Summary
Key ideas
- A study found that trigger warnings may not increase anxiety but can change beliefs about trauma in a short-term
- The study had participants who were not college students and did not measure harm
- The triggers are meant to help people with trauma, but the study's authors excluded people with trauma from the research

Key learnings
- The study results are weak and not corrected for multiple testing
- The participants were not college students
- The study has not measured whether trigger warnings could help the people with trauma

Key questions
- What are the causes for concern with this study?
- Does reading a trigger warning have a lasting effect on beliefs about trauma?
- Do beliefs about trauma cause people to be more easily traumatized?

# SSC Survey Results: ADHD And Rejection Sensitivity
*August 14, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/08/14/ssc-survey-results-adhd-and-rejection-sensitivity/

## Summary
Key ideas
- ADHD is commonly linked to attention and focus difficulty, but Dr. William Dodson's conception includes rejection-sensitive dysphoria as a crucial feature.
- There is limited formal evidence to support the concept of rejection-sensitive dysphoria as a key part of ADHD.
- Some authors recommend alpha-agonists or MAOIs for treating rejection-sensitive dysphoria.
- The Forer Effect is the tendency for people to believe that generic statements describe them specially, and it may be a factor in the discussion of rejection-sensitive dysphoria.
- There have been two studies investigating the ADHD-rejection link; while one failed to find a correlation, the other provided some support for the hypothesis.
- An online survey of readers of the blog found that ADHD had the lowest rate of rejection sensitivity among the four psychiatric conditions studied.
- The author concludes that it is erroneous to promote the concept of rejection sensitivity as fundamental to ADHD.

Key learnings
- ADHD is typically associated with attention and focus problems, but some people consider rejection-sensitive dysphoria as a key feature of the condition.
- There is limited research evidence for the concept of rejection-sensitive dysphoria, and some authors recommend medications like alpha-agonists or MAOIs for treatment.
- The Forer Effect may contribute to people's acceptance of the concept of rejection sensitivity.
- Studies that have investigated the ADHD-rejection link have produced mixed results.
- An online survey of a group of people with ADHD and other psychiatric disorders found that ADHD had the lowest rate of rejection sensitivity among the disorders studied.
- It is important to avoid assuming that a patient's diagnosis is absolute and not influenced by other factors or by current trends.

Key questions
- What is rejection-sensitive dysphoria, and how does it differ from other traits commonly associated with ADHD?
- What evidence supports the concept of rejection-sensitive dysphoria as a key feature of ADHD, and what evidence contradicts it?
- Why do some authors recommend alpha-agonists or MAOIs for treating rejection-sensitive dysphoria, and what are the potential drawbacks of such treatments?
- How does the Forer Effect influence our understanding of psychiatric symptomatology, and what steps can we take to avoid this bias?
- How can researchers continue to investigate the relationship between ADHD and rejection sensitivity, and what kind of research methodology is necessary to produce robust findings?
- What do the results of the online survey suggest about the relationship between ADHD and rejection sensitivity, and what implications does this have for diagnosing and treating the condition?

# SSC Survey: Scattered Negative Results
*August 15, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/08/15/ssc-survey-scattered-negative-results/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The author's (Scott) blog traffic is declining, so he decides to write about last year's survey on perception questions, which has some negative results and is a summary of the survey.
- The author was unable to expand on the suggestive results of the survey, nor strengthen them.
- The author provides examples of how the correlations between different illusions and mental illnesses were low and lacked internal structure.
- The Surgeon Riddle produced the most impressive results on the survey, but it may be a confounder rather than an actual result.
- Age had a strong effect on the Parentheses Riddle, but nothing else.
- The factor analysis did not produce any significant results, with none of the factors correlating well with anything else, nor was there an obvious pattern.

Key learnings:
- The survey did not produce any exciting or conclusive results and lacked internal structure.
- Correlations between different illusions and mental illnesses were low and lacked internal structure.
- The Surgeon Riddle produced the most significant results on the survey, but it may be a confounder rather than an actual result.
- Age had a strong effect on the Parentheses Riddle, but nothing else.
- The factor analysis did not produce any significant results, and there was no structure to the correlations observed.

Key questions:
- Were the results confounded by other factors rather than being actual results?
- Can anyone do better than the author with the survey results?
- What is the significance of the effect of age on the Parentheses Riddle?
- What would a more principled definition of weirdness be?

# The Parentheses Riddle
*August 16, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/08/16/the-parentheses-riddle/

## Summary
Key ideas
- A trick question asks respondents to choose which of two sequences are best paired with parentheses “()”
- Most respondents choose either A (XYXX) or B (YXXY) as the correct answer
- Age is a significant factor, with people in their 20s twice as likely to choose B compared to those in their 60s

Key learnings
- Age may affect the ability to process parentheses in sequence
- IQ and SAT scores do not correlate with the ability to solve the parentheses question
- Conscientiousness and techiness only have a small effect on the ability to solve the question

Key questions
- Why are people in their 20s more likely to choose B as the correct answer?
- Is there a connection between age-related cognitive decline and the ability to solve the parentheses question?
- Could the medium-sized dementia-screening industry provide insights into this question?

# Practically-A-Book Review: EA Hotel
*August 20, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/08/20/practically-a-book-review-ea-hotel/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Effective altruism focuses on redirecting charity resources to the most important and successful charities
- San Francisco is an expensive city, making it difficult for smaller independent organizations to conduct research
- Greg Colbourn, an effective altruist and cryptocurrency investor, purchased a 17-bedroom hotel in Blackpool, northern England to offer free room and board to researchers working on effective altruist projects
- By living at the hotel, researchers can focus on their work without worrying about material needs
- The hotel can support people for £5700/year

Key learnings:
- The hotel project is a potential high impact, high prestige supporting role for those excited to be involved in such a capacity on an EA mission
- Living at the hotel is more cost-effective than giving people grants that allow researchers to support themselves
- Community building is becoming increasingly important to the further development of the EA movement
- The hotel provides a low-barrier-to-entry opportunity for researchers to work on effective altruist ideas

Key questions:
- Is the hotel project more effective than just spending the money on grants?
- How will the hotel ensure that guests are effective and productive researchers?
- What measures will the hotel have in place to prevent scammers and freeloaders?
- Will living at the hotel lead to increased focus, collaboration, and morale boosting productivity?

# Carbon Dioxide: An Open Door Policy
*August 23, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/08/23/carbon-dioxide-an-open-door-policy/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Indoor carbon dioxide levels can have a significant effect on cognitive ability and sleep quality.
- CO2 levels are typically much worse at night when the windows and doors are closed.
- Human exhalation is the main source of CO2, and buildings with many people in close proximity are the most concerning.
- Plants that participate in "dark fixation" can help to reduce CO2 levels in a room.

Key learnings
- Increasing CO2 concentration from the level of a well-ventilated building to the level of a poorly-ventilated building had profound effects on cognitive ability.
- Workers in the best-ventilated offices scored about 25% better on cognitive tests than in the worst-ventilated ones.
- High physiological levels of carbon dioxide can cause sleep disturbances, and reducing CO2 levels can lead to improved sleep quality and cognitive performance.

Key questions
- How can we ensure that buildings are properly ventilated to maintain healthy levels of CO2?
- What are the long-term effects of exposure to high levels of carbon dioxide?
- How can we better understand the individual variability in sensitivity to CO2 levels?

# Bulls**t Jobs (Part 1 of ∞)
*August 29, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/08/29/bullst-jobs-part-1-of-%e2%88%9e/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Patients requesting doctor's notes for workplace accommodations due to back pain is a common occurrence for the author
- Writing a note is easy and can save patients time and money, but the author is not equipped to provide medical recommendations for back pain and chairs
- The author's solution is to write a note stating only the patient's request and their name
- The author reflects on the prevalence of pointless or "bulls**t" jobs in the economy

Key learnings:
- Patients may request accommodations that fall outside of a psychiatrist's area of expertise
- Providing truthful, minimal information can save time and avoid creating false medical records
- The economy may contain many procedures and jobs that have lost their original purpose or usefulness

Key questions:
- How prevalent are these types of requests in healthcare, and how do other medical professionals handle them?
- What are the ethical implications of providing or refusing a doctor's note for back pain, particularly in cases where patients have limited access to medical care?
- To what extent do workplace procedures and regulations become ritualistic or meaningless, and how does this affect productivity and workers' quality of life?

# Bureaucracy As Active Ingredient
*August 30, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/08/30/bureaucracy-as-active-ingredient/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Sometimes bureaucracies create policies that are active in their plans
- Insurance companies are required to provide a new $10,000 medication to those who really need it
- Doctors have no incentive to say "No" to their patients
- The insurance company adding a cost makes it harder for doctors to check "Yes" always
- Organizations have a legal incentive not to deny people things
- They have an economic incentive not to say Yes to all requests they get

Key learnings
- An elegant way of separating out the needy from the greedy if every other option is closed to you.
- Organizations have a legal incentive not to deny people things but they have an economic incentive not to say yes to every request they get.

Key questions
- Does this explanation fit with evidence?
- Does this sort of thing explain rituals like doctor’s notes for back pain or ADHD diagnoses for stimulants?
- Is it a factor that disincentivizes existing bureaucracies from getting better?

# [ACC Entry] Does The Education System Adequately Serve Advanced Students?
*September 4, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/09/04/acc-entry-does-the-education-system-adequately-serve-advanced-students/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Teachers often focus on struggling students rather than gifted students.
- Underachievement is a real phenomenon for gifted students, and it is a top concern for various school practitioners.
- Even though small in numbers, this issue has a national impact.
- Gifted underachievement has a negative impact on students from at-risk demographics.
- Approaches like tutoring, acceleration, and ability grouping are possible solutions.
- There is ongoing debate surrounding ability grouping in schools.
- The evidence regarding the impact of tracking or heterogeneous grouping is inconclusive.
- Comprehensive ability grouping programs like Success for All and Direct Instruction show promise but are rarely used due to the major organizational changes required to implement them.
- Acceleration, or moving an individual student through the curriculum at a faster pace, is a successful option for gifted, underchallenged students, but is often considered a last resort.
- Schools are not solely focused on maximizing student learning, as there are trade-offs between competing educational goals.
- Historian David Labaree identifies three competing educational goals: democratic equality, social efficiency, and social mobility.
- Ability grouping and acceleration can exacerbate inequalities and parental pressure can push for acceleration even when it is not appropriate.
- Personalization software has a long history and has received significant investment, but effective teaching software is difficult to design and student engagement is a core challenge.
- The role of AI in education is to assist human educators and not to replace them.
- AI-powered tools can provide personalized learning experience to students.
- Machines can handle tasks such as grading, scheduling, and data analysis, which can free up time for educators to focus on teaching.
- Interdisciplinary approach to learning can facilitate creative problem-solving skills.

Key learnings:
- Gifted students are often neglected in the classroom, which can lead to underachievement and other issues.
- Underachievement is a real concern, and it affects gifted students from all backgrounds.
- Several approaches exist to address gifted underachievement, though each has its pros and cons.
- The impact of ability grouping in schools varies based on teaching and curriculum.
- Tracking benefits high-achieving students, but there is no clear evidence that it benefits most students.
- Comprehensive ability grouping programs like Success for All and Direct Instruction have shown to be successful, but are rarely used due to the effort required to implement them.
- Acceleration is a useful and necessary tool for gifted, underchallenged students, but should not be forced on those who are happy and successful without it.
- Schools have competing educational goals and are not solely focused on maximizing student learning.
- Ability grouping and acceleration can exacerbate inequalities and be academically and socially inappropriate.
- Effective teaching software is difficult to design and student engagement is a core challenge.
- Collaborative learning environment is crucial for effective use of AI-powered tools.
- Providing practical advice to students, educators, and tech designers can facilitate the integration of AI in the education system.

Key questions:
- What causes gifted underachievement, and how can schools address it?
- How can schools support gifted students without neglecting other students in the classroom?
- Are there other approaches beyond tutoring, acceleration, and ability-grouping that could help address gifted underachievement?
- What is the impact of ability grouping on academic and social well-being?
- How do we balance the use of acceleration with other options for gifted, underchallenged students?
- What prevents comprehensive ability grouping programs like Success for All and Direct Instruction from being more widely adopted?
- What are the implications of having competing educational goals for student learning?
- How can schools address parental pressure for acceleration without exacerbating inequality?
- What are the key factors in designing effective teaching software?
- How can online learning tools balance the passion and self-pacing of eager students with the social and motivational structures present in schools?
- How can we ensure that AI-powered education tools do not reinforce biases and inequalities?
- How can we measure the effectiveness of AI-powered education tools in improving learning outcomes?
- What policies should be implemented to address ethical concerns related to the use of AI in education?

# [ACC Entry] Are Islam And Liberal Democracy Compatible?
*September 5, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/09/05/acc-entry-are-islam-and-liberal-democracy-compatible/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Two basic narratives exist in the Western world about Islam and its compatibility with democracy and liberalism.
- Investigating the recent political history of Islamic countries where democracy and liberalism obtained as well as their implementation can reveal the possibilities for the future.
- The UAE constitution, while containing liberal protections and commitments, is not democratic and perpetuates oligarchical rule.
- The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a constitutional monarchy, but its leaders act unilaterally and arbitrarily, disregarding constitutional law.
- Tunisia, in contrast, successfully established a high-functioning democracy in the wake of the Arab Spring, with a constitution that establishes term limits, a constitutional court, and balance of powers.
- Tunisia's success in establishing democratic mechanisms is due to widespread agreement and assent to the rules of democratic process.
- Tunisia has made strides in consolidating and refining its democratic processes but faces resistance from the extreme religious right.
- Efforts to remove Shariah-based laws, such as those criminalizing homosexuality, female inheritance, and the death penalty, are moving forward.
- However, these political shifts are producing an increase in Islamic radicalization, leading to indiscriminate arrests, censorship, and unfair trials.
- In Indonesia, corruption is rampant, and recent debates about the role of Islam in its constitution have revealed a struggle between competing political visions.
- The constitution ensures freedoms and human rights but also allows the government to suppress political dissidents and "non-traditional" religious groups.
- Kazakhstan has had a complicated history of conflicting influences, including colonization by Russia and the suppression of Islamic and traditional culture by the Soviet Union.
- Kazakhstan is an authoritarian state where the suppression of political opposition and control of Islam are utilized to preserve the government's power.
- Iran's history of colonization and modernization efforts influenced the rise of Folk-Islam and theocratic rule.
- Iran's constitution is not democratic or liberal, with the Ayatollah holding ultimate power over political, legislative, and judicial decisions.
- Iran is an authoritarian regime, where the Ayatollah maintains a firm grip on power through legitimate constitutional mechanisms
- The balance of power in Lebanon operates through a confessional system, which is divided along religious lines
- Lebanon recently underwent electoral reforms to create interreligious coalitions and decrease sectarian tensions
- Lebanon's constitution contains contradictions in terms of human rights and freedom of speech
- Greater control of the border is required for Lebanon to extend its civil rights.
- The intersection of Islam and liberal democracy is a recent phenomenon that is error-prone.
- Liberal democracy requires that countries shift expectations for what types of society can be achieved.
- Muslim countries with liberal and democratic policies correlate with economic prosperity and security.

Key learnings:
- Religious culture is a powerful force within society and can mobilize political action.
- Investigating the politics of a particular community over time more adequately casts light on the possibilities for the future than the foundational texts of the culture.
- The arrangement and structure of government bodies provide minimal checks on arbitrary decision making on the part of the Supreme Council in the UAE.
- Constitutional law may exist, but it is not always observed in practice.
- The successful establishment of a democracy requires widespread agreement and trust in the rules of democratic process.
- Consolidating democracy is an ongoing struggle that can produce unintended consequences, such as an increase in Islamic radicalization.
- Cultural heritage and traditional beliefs can clash with liberal democracy and human rights, leading to difficult choices about national security and human rights.
- Corruption poses a threat to democratic values and institutions, making it difficult to achieve prosperity and stability.
- Control of religion and political opposition are common tactics used by authoritarian states to maintain power.
- Iran's history of colonization and modernization efforts contributed to its current political structure and the rise of theocratic rule.
- Iran's constitution may not be democratic or liberal, despite its allowance for political parties and popular secret elections.
- Iran's democracy is superficial, with religious authorities having the final say in any decision
- The confessional balance-of-power system in Lebanon maintains basic democracy through its quotas and coalitions, although it has flaws in terms of human rights and sectarian tension
- Electoral reforms have the potential to create more unified coalitions and decrease sectarian violence in Lebanon, but more reforms are necessary
- While Lebanon is culturally diverse and productive, it still struggles with preserving freedom of speech and accepting secularism
- Democratic mechanisms enjoy different levels of protection and functionality in different countries.
- There is no clear answer as to whether Islamic belief and practice act as an obstacle to liberal democracy.
- Existing probabilities indicate the path and possibilities towards liberal democracy different countries can take.

Key questions:
- How do religious cultures inform every aspect of a pious person’s outlook and life?
- What criteria is used in selecting who is allowed to vote in the UAE?
- Can the UAE constitution eventually lead to a democratic order?
- What are the limitations on democratic participation in the UAE?
- What factors contributed to Tunisia's success in establishing democratic mechanisms?
- How can other countries successfully establish functioning democracies, given the various challenges and potential pitfalls?
- How can Tunisia balance its efforts to remove discriminatory laws and practices with the need to combat extremism?
- What does the struggle between competing political visions in Indonesia reveal about the challenges of democracy and Islam?
- Is there a way for Kazakhstan to reconcile its complex history and influences with a commitment to human rights and democratic values?
- How can individuals and organizations challenge authoritarian regimes like those in Kazakhstan and Iran?
- To what extent do colonization and modernization efforts contribute to current political structures in other countries?
- How can democracies support movements towards democratization and liberalization in non-democratic countries without resorting to regime-change operations?
- How might Iran undergo a genuine democratic transition in the future?
- Could Lebanon eventually shift towards a secular government and society?
- How can Lebanon's family law system be reformed to provide greater gender equality?
- What role can the international community play in promoting human rights in Iran and Lebanon?
- Does current Islamic belief and practice act as an obstacle to liberal democracy more often than not?
- To what extent do liberal democratic Muslims constitute a viable cultural force?
- How can countries achieve greater functioning democratic mechanisms and support security, prosperity, and justice?

# [ACC Entry] Should Childhood Vaccination Be Mandatory?
*September 6, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/09/06/acc-entry-should-childhood-vaccination-be-mandatory/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Vaccination is an important tool for promoting public health and has been successful in eradicating some diseases and preventing outbreaks.
- Vaccines should undergo continual safety surveillance, and any potential adverse effects should be factored into the risk-benefit analysis.
- The benefits of vaccines can differ depending on the vaccine type and the socio-economic context in which they are used.
- Vaccination should not be a one-off check of safety, and ongoing inquiries are needed.
- The statement "vaccines are safe" cannot be applied across the board to all vaccines ever created.
- Mandatory vaccination policies should be justified and not rigidly unyielding.
- In some European nations, vaccination is not mandatory, but they still achieve high vaccination rates.
- Mandatory vaccination may not be necessary in developed nations to achieve public health objectives.
- The most common known risk of vaccination is the potential for an allergic response to some component of the vaccine.
- The hygiene hypothesis suggests that the removal of bacterial and parasitic infections throughout human evolution may be a cause of modern immune system problems.
- Different hypotheses suggest that vaccines contribute to autoimmune, autoinflammatory, and atopic diseases, protect against them, or have no demonstrable impact on them.
- The Amish, who live on farms, and people who work with livestock have a lower rate of developing immune system disorders.
- Investigating dietary changes and transplantation are some possible interventions to achieve a balance towards protective commensal bacteria.
- The development of an anti-hookworm vaccine could be a beneficial intervention to address iron deficiency in developing countries.
- While there is not strong evidence that vaccines drive autoimmunity and atopy, research should be focused on disease exposure and not just vaccination status.
- Ongoing surveillance of vaccine safety is crucial, as it is impossible to "prove a negative."
- Mandatory vaccination is not necessary, as achieving herd immunity can be done without removing individuals' medical decision-making abilities.
- Alternatives to mandates should be studied to provide policy-makers with readily available alternatives.
- While "precautionary principle" approaches to vaccinations for individual children may be understandable, they cannot be recommended as a matter of public policy.

Key learnings:
- Vaccines are not a one-size-fits-all tool for promoting public health, and their safety and benefits need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
- Mandatory vaccination policies should be weighed against the benefits and risks involved.
- Vaccine safety requires ongoing inquiries and scrutiny.
- Any identified harm from vaccines must be outweighed by the benefits they confer to recommend them.
- The most common known risk of vaccination is very low.
- The hygiene hypothesis suggests that modern medical technology has eliminated infections that perform an important function in the human immune system.
- There are different hypotheses about the impact of vaccines on autoimmune, autoinflammatory, and atopic diseases, but most studies have found no demonstrable link.
- People who live on farms have a much lower rate of developing immune system disorders.
- Vaccines are an important element of disease control and eradication.
- There is no compelling evidence of long-lasting or permanent negative side effects of vaccines.
- The conflict in the vaccination debate is between individual dissent and community solidarity.

Key questions:
- What are the potential adverse effects of vaccines, and how can they be mitigated?
- How can we balance individual freedom with the need to promote public health through vaccination?
- What is the most effective way to ensure high vaccination rates without imposing rigidly unyielding mandatory policies?
- Can mandatory vaccination be effective in other nations with unique health care systems, laws, policies, and behavioral norms?
- What are the implications if the hypothesis linking vaccination against endemic diseases and the increase in allergy and autoimmunity were confirmed?
- What are the specific commensal bacteria that humans need to prevent developing immune system diseases?
- How can the efficacy of the introduction of killed bacteria into atopic individuals and the retraining of the gut commensal balance be tested?
- How can we achieve a balance towards protective commensal bacteria?
- What is the best approach to address iron deficiency in developing countries?
- Do vaccines drive autoimmunity and atopy, and how can we appropriately investigate this question in the future?
- What can we do to ensure ongoing surveillance of vaccine safety?
- When is mandatory vaccination necessary, and what are some alternatives to mandates that should be studied?
- How can we reconcile individual dissent and community solidarity regarding vaccination?

# [ACC Entry] Should Transgender Children Transition?
*September 8, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/09/08/acc-entry-should-transgender-children-transition/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Transgender childhood transition is a hotly debated topic.
- Two contradicting opinions regarding treatment approaches for gender dysphoria: gender-affirming and therapeutic.
- DSM defines gender dysphoria as the presence of clinically significant distress associated with gender nonconformity.
- Social transitioning and puberty blockers should be approached with caution due to limited evidence on long-term effects.
- Acceptance of transgender individuals is relatively low, and gender dysphoria doesn't have a perfect overlap with being transgender.
- Statistical evidence supports that at least 25% of children with GID diagnoses desist, and probably closer to/upwards of 50%.
- Gender dysphoria in children can be fluid, and some children who express a desire to transition later identify with their natal sex.
- Social transitioning, which involves presenting as the gender of one's non-natal sex, can have positive and negative effects on mental health and may or may not lead to persistent gender dysphoria.
- Children who persist with gender dysphoria generally have stronger cross-gender feelings and a stronger aversion to their physical anatomy.
- Family support and media exposure may influence whether children express a desire to socially transition.
- Transgender identity is a cultural-context dependent phenomenon.
- Distress faced by transgender individuals is related to their treatment within society rather than gender identity itself.
- Puberty blockers have some positive mental health effects.
- Puberty blockers may have physical health consequences including on bone growth.
- Desistance is a possibility among gender dysphoric youth and a sizable fraction of individuals who express desires to be the opposite gender in childhood, do not feel the same way at a later point in life.
- Social transitioning can reduce the rates of internalizing problems and anxiety among gender dysphoric youth.

Key learnings:
- Both gender-affirming and therapeutic approaches have support from some experts.
- Social transitioning and puberty blockers should be chosen carefully and in consultation with experts, considering preexisting biases and exposure to social norms.
- Gender dysphoria is not the same as being transgender and is associated with clinically significant distress.
- Desistence, although its terminology is controversial, refers to children who previously expressed gender nonconformity and no longer feel gender dysphoria.
- Evidence shows that at least 25% of children with GID diagnoses desisted, and probably closer to/upwards of 50%.
- Gender identity is not always fixed, and children who express a desire to transition may not continue to feel gender dysphoria in the future.
- Mental health issues associated with gender dysphoria can be reduced with increased family support and validation of identities, but sex reassignment does not alleviate all negative associations.
- Social transitioning is controversial and may have mixed effects on mental health and future gender identity.
- Transgender identity is not a mental disorder.
- The psychological consequences of commencing puberty as a gender dysphoric child or youth must be weighed against any potential health effects when deciding about puberty blockers.
- There is a lack of agreement between sources on whether gender dysphoric youth who will persist and desist can be differentiated from each other.
- Long-term effects of social transitioning, puberty blockers, and gender dysphoria treatments are something policy makers, medical experts, and trans advocates may wish to consider.

Key questions:
- Who should parents believe when the experts disagree?
- What are the long-term effects of social transitioning and puberty blockers?
- What can be done to increase acceptance of transgender individuals?
- How can parents and experts differentiate between gender-nonconforming and truly gender dysphoric children?
- How can discussions of desistence be reframed to avoid diminishing the validity of transgender youth identities?
- What is the extent of the positive and negative effects of social transitioning on mental health?
- How can family support be increased to improve mental health outcomes for gender dysphoric children?
- What factors contribute to whether a child will persist with gender dysphoria or not?
- What are the potential risks of adopting puberty blockers?
- What is the correlation between the strength of transgender expression and persistence or desistence?
- Does social transitioning retain the gender dysphoric feelings and transgender identities of individuals who undergo it?
- What are the long-term effects of social transitioning, puberty blockers, and gender dysphoria treatments?

# In The Balance
*September 12, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/09/12/in-the-balance/

## Summary
Key ideas
- When one takes the Artifact, they are given a vision of four demons, each advocating for a different principle (Order, Chaos, Balance, Excess).
- The demons encourage the individual to devote the Artifact to their respective domains, which are presented in idealistic visions.
- The individual is urged to seek balance between the principles of Order and Chaos, but is then presented with infinite levels of balance, generating new dilemmas.
- The author chooses first-level balance, throwing the Artifact to the ground, which silences the demonic hierarchy.

Key learnings
- The pursuit of balance can become obsessive and ultimately futile.
- The principles of Order and Chaos and their interaction may be necessary for human flourishing.
- Sometimes a decision is necessary when faced with an infinite regress of further options.
- The virtues of moderation and commitment may present a better balance than zeal and carefulness.

Key questions
- How can one balance the pursuit of good and the avoidance of evil?
- Is there such a thing as too much balance or too little?
- How can one make decisions in the face of an infinite number of choices?
- What is the distinction between obsession and commitment?

# The Omnigenic Model As Metaphor For Life
*September 13, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/09/13/the-omnigenic-model-as-metaphor-for-life/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- We underestimate our intellectual progress because every sliver of knowledge acquired gets backpropagated unboundedly into the past.
- In the past, people talked about finding "the gene for intelligence" on just a couple of chromosomes, but this was an oversimplified view.
- Modern genetics has advanced by accepting the complexity of the genome and testing for many factors instead of just one or two.
- Other fields of study, such as psychiatry, may benefit from a move toward looking for more numerous causes rather than just one cause.

Key learnings:
- Genetics is complex, but it is simple in that there are a finite number of possible causes.
- Polycausal models that incorporate many factors may be a more productive way to study complex phenomena like depression.
- Rather than trying to find "the" cause or "the" ten causes, researchers should focus on figuring out how to deal with numerous causes.

Key questions:
- What can other fields like psychiatry learn from genetics about dealing with polycausality?
- How can we use polycausal scores to diagnose and treat depression and other complex disorders?
- How can we best balance simplicity and complexity in our scientific models of the world?

# Book Review: The Black Swan
*September 19, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/09/19/book-review-the-black-swan/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The Bell curve can represent normal distributions, while power law distributions follow an Extremistan.
- Achievements in the power law distribution follow black swan events.
- Taleb proposes the “barbell” strategy to deal with Knightian uncertainty.
- The Black Swan discusses the ludic fallacy and Platonicity concepts.
- The Black Swan is about human fallibility and fitting power law distributions.
- The debate on the role of theory and empiricism in various fields such as medicine and finance.
- The Black Swan theory as a critique of over-reliance on theory and the need for more empirical observations.
- The potential dangers of relying solely on empirical observations and ignoring theory.
- The Black Swan by Nassim Nicholas Taleb is a well-crafted, persuasive argument for abandoning our attempts at predicting the future and embracing the idea of unpredictability.
- Taleb's autobiographical stories make a convincing aesthetic argument that we should strive for a life built around embracing uncertainty and taking advantage of positive "black swan" events.
- Taleb has outlasted other public figures in the rationality movement and still continues to produce object-level work in his field.

Key learnings:
- Power law distributions are more relevant for events with a low probability of occurrence and higher variation.
- The “barbell” strategy can manage risk more effectively than investing in medium-risk investments.
- Empirical ideas and theory must coexist to form a more substantial way of managing uncertainty.
- The importance of balancing theory and empiricism in decision-making and understanding.
- The limitations of empirical observations and the need for theoretical models to account for unmeasurable risks.
- The role of bias and incentives in decision-making.
- We should embrace uncertainty and positive unpredictable events instead of seeking to predict the future.
- Aesthetically, it is better to embrace the unexpected and pursue satisfying, dynamic lives than live a life of predictability.
- The public fascination with human rationality in the past decade has waned, but Taleb continues to do great object-level work in his field.

Key questions:
- Are book reviews in Mediocristan or Extremistan?
- What is the difference between Knightian uncertainty and quantified risk?
- How can we find the Golden Mean between empiricism and theory?
- How much weight should be given to theory vs. empiricism in different fields?
- How can we balance the potential risks of black swan events with the benefits of empirical observations?
- What is the role of intellect and curiosity in understanding the world, and how can they be fostered in individuals and society?
- Who is still doing Kahneman-level work and continuing advancements in rationality studies?
- What other works has Taleb contributed to expanding his principles further?
- How can individuals apply the principles of embracing uncertainty and unpredictability to their own lives?

- The prodrome of schizophrenia is an early stage of the condition when a person is developing schizophrenia and acting strange while still having some insight into their condition.
- There is a push to treat schizophrenia prodrome aggressively to prevent full schizophrenia from ever developing at all.
- Observational studies have tested whether duration of untreated psychosis correlates with poor outcome, but there is a lot of potential confounding and randomized controlled trials tend to do very badly and rarely show any benefit.
- Schizophrenia starts with aberrant prediction errors, and as schizophrenics encounter more strange events, their high-level beliefs further alter to explain them.
- Antipsychotics treat the positive symptoms of schizophrenia well, but not the negative symptoms much at all because they don't treat the learned helplessness about cognition.
- The longer someone is psychotic, the more their brain is going to shift from its normal mode of evidence-processing to whatever mode of evidence-processing best suits receiving lots of random data.
- The author (Scott) talks about his delusional system taking a religious turn.
- Scott believed that his suicide would save the world by letting Jesus return to rule.
- Medical authorities recognized Scott's psychotic state and treated him with antipsychotic drugs, which eventually helped him make a full recovery.

Key learnings:
- Treating schizophrenia prodrome aggressively enough can prevent full schizophrenia from ever developing at all.
- Observational studies on the correlation between duration of untreated psychosis and poor outcome have potential confounding factors.
- Schizophrenia starts with aberrant prediction errors and as schizophrenics encounter more strange events, their high-level beliefs further alter to explain them.
- Antipsychotics treat the positive symptoms of schizophrenia well, but not the negative symptoms much at all because they don't treat the learned helplessness about cognition.
- The longer someone is psychotic, the more their brain is going to shift from its normal mode of evidence-processing to whatever mode of evidence-processing best suits receiving lots of random data.
- The use of antipsychotic drugs helped Scott overcome his delusional thoughts and make a full recovery.

Key questions:
- Should schizophrenia prodrome be treated as a critical period for intervention?
- How can researchers effectively study the correlation between duration of untreated psychosis and poor outcome?
- What is the best way to prevent schizophrenia from developing if someone is experiencing aberrant prediction errors?
- How can antipsychotics be improved to better treat the negative symptoms of schizophrenia?
- Can the brain shift back to its normal mode of evidence-processing after being psychotic for a long time?
- What could have happened to Scott if he hadn't received medical attention or antipsychotic drugs?
- How do we differentiate between religious beliefs and delusional thoughts in cases like Scott's?

# The Tails Coming Apart As Metaphor For Life
*September 25, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/09/25/the-tails-coming-apart-as-metaphor-for-life/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The most extreme value of one variable is rarely the most extreme value of another variable, even if the two are strongly correlated. 
- Happiness is an amalgam of correlated properties such as subjective well-being, positive emotions, and meaningfulness. 
- Each of these properties is also an amalgam, leading to an unprincipled conflation of these properties. 
- People learn the concept of happiness from training data and build different classifiers, which can lead to different concepts of happiness. 
- The further we go toward the tails in morality, the more extreme the divergences become, and different moral systems form different classifiers. 

Key learnings
- Different variables with strong correlations can have different levels of extremes. 
- Happiness is an amalgam of correlated properties that are difficult to quantify and can lead to different concepts of happiness. 
- Morality in the tails diverges depending on the moral system, and ethical subjectivists face the problem of figuring out what to do with the fact that any moral rule followed to infinity will diverge from large parts of what we mean by morality. 

Key questions 
- Why do the tails come apart, even if two variables are strongly correlated? 
- Why do people have different concepts of happiness, and how does this affect our understanding of happiness? 
- How does the problem of morality in the tails affect ethical subjectivists who believe that morality has to do with our conception of morality?

# Adversarial Collaboration Contest Results
*September 26, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/09/26/adversarial-collaboration-contest-results/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Winners of the adversarial collaboration contest are announced
- The collaboration on education garnered the most popular vote, while the author chose the collaboration on transgender children as the winner
- The author provides brief critiques of all the collaborations, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each
- The author asked the collaborators to send reports on their process, which are briefly summarized
- The collaboration between Scott and TW involved a lot of debate and integration of different fields of education research.
- Adversarial collaborations can work best when there is high levels of trust beforehand and a clear division of labor.
- The collaboration between JohnBuridan and ChristianFlanery involved constant unceasing debate, but in a context of high levels of trust.
- Mark W's initial position was that herd immunity is a compelling government interest, and that it is well within the power of a reasonable government to implement a mandatory policy in order to achieve this end.
- Most of the debate between Mark W and Mark Davis was about whether vaccines can lead to autoimmunity.
- Some of the adversarial collaborations failed to solve the main disagreements between the two parties and instead shifted to a less contentious topic.
- Almost no one changed their mind on the overall issue, but everyone moderated their opinion at least a little.
- Pseudoscience topics that are mostly discredited have a risk of being legitimized through the adversarial collaboration format.

Key learnings:
- Adversarial collaborations can be a useful thinking tool and a great learning experience
- It takes a lot of time and willingness to talk about the entire topic, not just pet issues
- Disagreements can often boil down to differing priorities and interpretations of object-level facts
- Making sense of classroom questions is going to involve more fuzziness and wandering than for certain other questions.
- Establishing high levels of trust and designing a method and framework are essential for effective adversarial collaborations.
- The burden of proof usually lies with the side opposing a policy.
- Collaborators should choose titles and stake out specific claims from the start.
- Concluding with whether conditions were met or not is an important element.
- A third, impartial moderator can help resolve disagreements.
- Collaboration participants should be open-minded and agreeable.

Key questions:
- What were the biggest weaknesses of the winning collaboration on transgender children?
- Should America have mandatory childhood vaccinations?
- Are Muslim countries less likely to be democratic than other countries?
- Are adversarial collaborations more effective when opponents are pitted against each other or when cooperation is promoted?
- What are the ethical implications of opposing vaccination on the grounds that it's necessary to experience disease exposure in order to protect against autoimmunity?
- What changes could be made for future adversarial collaborations?
- How can the adversarial collaboration format avoid legitimizing pseudoscience theories?
- What is the importance of having an impartial moderator in an adversarial collaboration?

# Steelmanning The NIMBYs
*October 1, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/01/steelmanning-the-nimbys/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- YIMBYism is a movement to build more and denser housing in cities, but it is often emotional and closed-minded.
- San Francisco is doing okay compared to other US cities when it comes to building new housing, but demand keeps increasing.
- Building more housing in San Francisco is not an easy way to lower rents, and even if it works, it will take decades to do anything.
- The idea that holdouts who oppose development are inexcusably selfish, hate poor people, or are racist is overly simplistic.
- The author challenges the argument that building more housing in cities like San Francisco will automatically lead to lower housing costs and higher quality of life for residents.
- There are deeper social and economic issues that need to be addressed to truly solve the problem of housing affordability and availability in cities.
- Centralization in certain industries, like tech, contributes to the concentration of people in cities like San Francisco, which perpetuates the housing crisis and other challenges.

Key learnings:
- The fight over housing is often emotional and divisive.
- Building more housing is not a panacea for high housing costs and displacement.
- The problem of how to accommodate different preferences for living environments is difficult to solve.
- Affordable housing policies alone are not sufficient to address the challenges facing housing availability and quality of life in cities.
- Solutions to these challenges will require addressing larger social and economic issues, such as the concentration of jobs and people in certain urban areas and the lack of economic opportunities in less dense areas.
- There is no simple or easy solution to the problem of housing affordability and availability in cities.

Key questions:
- How can we create a more cooperative and inclusive conversation around housing policy?
- What are some alternative approaches to dealing with high housing costs and displacement?
- How can we strike a balance between the needs and preferences of different groups of people?
- What can be done to address the concentration of people and jobs in certain urban areas, which perpetuates the housing crisis and other challenges?
- How can we balance the interests of different demographic groups in addressing issues of housing affordability and availability?
- What role can federal and local policies play in decentralized industries and create more opportunities in less dense areas?

# Highlights From The Comments On NIMBYs
*October 2, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/02/highlights-from-the-comments-on-nimbys/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- There is a debate between urbanists who support city living and those who prefer suburban living.
- People have varying preferences for what makes an acceptable place to live.
- The YIMBY movement and upzoning policies are controversial topics in the debate.
- Some argue that increasing density in cities may worsen existing problems, while others support it for economic and environmental benefits.
- There is evidence to suggest that agglomeration effects may not be as significant as some claim.
- NIMBYism is exacerbating regional economic inequality.
- The trend of per capita incomes in rich and poor regions converging stopped and even reversed in the late 1960s when zoning became widespread.
- Prop 13 in California favors commercial over residential developments, leading to a shortage of places for workers to live.
- High housing costs in California contribute to the high cost of living, which leads to higher infrastructure costs, as labor costs more.
- The incentives for cities to add more jobs than places to live are based on a broken revenue model relating to pensions.

Key learnings:
- People's preferences for urban vs suburban living vary widely and are often deeply entrenched.
- Upzoning policies and the YIMBY movement are controversial and generate strong opposition from some individuals.
- There is no clear consensus on whether increasing density in cities will have a positive or negative impact on quality of life.
- Caps on production of housing near jobs can weaken workers’ bargaining power by limiting worker mobility.
- Prop 13 in California, which caps annual property tax increases, leads to depressed property taxes and higher impact fees for new developments.
- High housing costs can contribute to infrastructure costs because labor costs are higher, which exacerbates the high cost of living.

Key questions:
- What are the most significant challenges facing cities today in terms of accommodating increasing populations?
- Can cities be designed in a way that meets the needs of different individuals with varying preferences for urban/suburban living?
- Is there a way to resolve the debate between urbanists and suburbanites without either group having to make significant compromises?
- How can cities and regions address the broken revenue model relating to pensions?
- How can the incentives for cities to add more jobs than places to live be reshaped?
- How can housing production near jobs be increased without negatively affecting existing residents’ quality of life?

# Next Door In Nodrumia
*October 4, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/04/next-door-in-nodrumia/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The article discusses a scenario where inhabitants of Nodrumia found a corporation that owns all the property in the area and distributes usage rights.
- The usage rights come with restrictions on things like playing drums.
- An individual who wants to move out of Nodrumia and sell their house is prevented from doing so when the highest bidder is a drummer who wants to turn the property into a studio.
- This scenario poses a question about libertarian philosophy and private property rights versus the rights of a community to govern itself and ban certain activities.
- The article proposes that a libertarian treatment of the issue would argue that towns have the most right to pass restrictive laws when things like exit rights are most salient, and then less right when they aren’t.
- The article suggests that charter cities could be a solution for YIMBYs, and gives the example of Irvine, California.
- The housing crisis in California is a result of restrictive zoning laws and resistance to new housing.
- The idea of charter cities, with their own independent governments and regulation, could provide a solution to the crisis.
- California already has some legal provisions for charter cities, and some parts of the state are experiencing third-world conditions.

Key learnings:
- Libertarian philosophy proposes that private landowners should be able to determine what happens on their property.
- Communities have a right to be governed by laws made by a democratically elected council.
- The analysis suggests that whether an institution is more like a corporation or intentional community versus a national government determines the degree to which said institution has the right to be strict.
- The article suggests that letting towns be at least kind of like private property can help retain some distinction from each other in society.
- The housing crisis is a complex issue with multiple factors at play.
- Solutions to the crisis may require creative thinking and a willingness to explore unconventional options.
- Charter cities may be a viable solution to the problem, but their implementation would likely face significant challenges.

Key questions:
- Who is in the right according to libertarian philosophy: the Nodrumian inhabitants or the drummer who wants to turn property into a studio?
- What kind of characteristics determine whether an institution is more like a corporation or intentional community versus a national government?
- Do towns have the same rights as a private company to impose restrictions?
- What is the author's stance on eminent domain?
- Can charter cities be a solution for YIMBYs?
- What would be required to make charter cities a reality in California?
- What are the risks and potential downsides of pursuing charter cities as a solution?
- How can we balance the need for affordable housing with concerns about urban sprawl and environmental impact?

# Kavanaugh: A Probability Poll
*October 8, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/08/kavanaugh-a-probability-poll/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- People are more cautious when thinking probabilistically.
- Survey of 2,350 people estimating probability of Kavanaugh guilt in sexual assault case.
- Average probability is 52.64%, but there's a partisan and gender skew in responses.
- People with high knowledge of Kavanaugh more likely to lean innocent.
- No real consensus on how plausible an accusation has to be before it means someone should be denied nomination.
- In a hypothetical universe where Kavanaugh immediately admitted and apologized for his actions, 55% of people would accept him.

Key learnings:
- People are able to admit to a little bit of uncertainty in their answers when using probabilities.
- However, partisan biases and strong differences in opinions remain.
- There is no consensus on this issue in the general demographic and even unbiased people as a group cannot send a coherent signal.

Key questions:
- Does encouraging people to think probabilistically actually affect the accuracy of their answers?
- How can partisan biases be removed from surveys on controversial topics?
- What other factors should be considered in looking at a nominee's background beyond sexual assault allegations?

# The Chamber of Guf
*October 15, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/15/the-chamber-of-guf/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The Chamber of Guf in Jewish legend is like the subconscious holding all thoughts and desires.
- Lampreys' brains subconsciously consider many behaviors and compete to be enacted.
- Mental states affect the likelihood of which behaviors will make it to consciousness.
- Certain disorders, like Gay OCD, occur when the brain raises thoughts based on strong emotions, even if they don't align with a person's actual desires or identity.
- Same medications that treat normal OCD can treat these disorders.

Key learnings:
- The basal ganglia in the brain keeps all behaviors in "off" mode by default and turns off inhibitory control once a specific action's bid has been selected.
- Mental states, like anxiety or high dopamine states, affect the conscious thoughts that arise from the subconscious.
- A theory of Gay OCD is that the brain raises thoughts based on strong emotions, leading to false interpretations and obsessions.

Key questions:
- How do different mental states affect the selection of thoughts that rise to consciousness?
- What other disorders might arise from the same process as Gay OCD?
- How do treatments for Gay OCD and similar disorders work, and how effective are they?

# Is Science Slowing Down?
*October 15, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/15/is-science-slowing-down/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Bloom, Jones, Reenen & Webb (2018) argue that scientific progress is slowing down despite an exponential increase in the number of researchers.
- The number of researchers has grown exponentially over the past century, while progress in most fields has been constant or slowing down.
- BJRW’s method of comparing percent change in progress with the absolute number of researchers shows that each researcher has become about 25x less productive in making discoveries that translate into economic growth over the past ninety years.
- Most participants at the conference explain the trend through the “low-hanging fruit” explanation, which suggests all the most significant discoveries were made a long time ago, and research has been picking at the margins ever since.
- The author discusses the idea of the Gods Of Straight Lines, which means the tendency of human society to follow predictable patterns and structures.
- The author argues that this tendency can have both positive and negative effects on society.
- The author questions the role of scientific progress and innovation in this framework.

Key learnings:
- Comparing progress rates with the absolute number of researchers is essential when predicting scientific progress.
- The exponential increase in the number of researchers and the emergence of low-hanging fruit are the most probable explanations for why scientific progress has slowed down.
- The structure and predictability of human society can provide benefits in terms of efficiency and progress.
- However, it can also limit creativity and unique problem-solving.
- There is a potential danger in attempting to disrupt or drastically change the current structure of society.

Key questions:
- Why is progress in science slowing down despite exponential increases in the number of researchers?
- Is it possible to fix the problem of scientific progress slowing down?
- What accounts for the lower productivity of researchers today?
- Is it possible to balance the benefits and drawbacks of the structure of human society?
- What is the role of innovation in this framework?
- How can we ensure that progress and creativity are not stifled by predictability and structure?

# Cognitive Enhancers: Mechanisms And Tradeoffs
*October 22, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/22/cognitive-enhancers-mechanisms-and-tradeoffs/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- "Smart drugs" are substances that enhance learning and memory.
- Two of the most effective "smart drugs" are piracetam and nicotine, which activate the brain's acetylcholine system.
- Acetylcholine is a neuromodulator that encodes changes in the precision of prediction errors in sensory cortical hierarchies.
- Modulating acetylcholine levels can affect learning rates and the balance between top-down processes that determine what you should be expecting to see, and bottom-up processes that determine what you're actually seeing.
- High levels of acetylcholine from study drugs may help certain types of learning, but there may be trade-offs.

Key learnings:
- The brain's acetylcholine system is important for learning and memory.
- Study drugs that modulate the brain's acetylcholine system may enhance learning, but the effects are subtle and may have trade-offs.
- Acetylcholine helps set the learning rate in the brain, which can affect the balance between top-down and bottom-up processing.

Key questions:
- Why do we need "smart drugs" to enhance learning and memory?
- Is there a trade-off between the potential benefits of study drugs and their possible side effects?
- How does the brain balance top-down processes that determine what you should be expecting to see and bottom-up processes that determine what you're actually seeing?

# Nominating Oneself For The Short End Of A Tradeoff
*October 24, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/24/nominating-oneself-for-the-short-end-of-a-tradeoff/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The author provides three examples where there has to be a tradeoff, and someone has to lose.
- In each example, the author feels that the party that "loses" has nominated themselves to do so.
- The author's intuitions about who should "lose" don't always align with utilitarianism.

Key learnings:
- Sometimes, despite good intentions, a tradeoff must be made, and someone will be worse off.
- The author's moral intuitions about who should "lose" in such situations differ from utilitarianism.

Key questions:
- What are the consequences of dismissing these situations as misfirings of the "consequences of actions" heuristic?
- Is the idea that people can "reveal their true preferences" always accurate?
- Is the desire to let people who make bad choices suffer just a utilitarian justification crystallized into a moral principle, or is it a distinct moral principle?

# Sort By Controversial
*October 30, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/30/sort-by-controversial/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- A startup uses machine learning to predict which ads will get the most likes based on their Reddit upvotes.
- They test the network on their internal subreddit and create a maximally controversial statement, which leads to a five-hour argument in the office and the firing of two coders for gross incompetence and insubordination.
- They realize the potential power of the maximally controversial statement and decide to pivot from online advertising to superweapons by contacting the Pentagon.
- They use Shiri's Scissor, the controversial-creating network, to generate a statement targeting Mozambique to show to the Pentagon, but later face legal repercussions when two fired coders sue the company for unfair dismissal and racial discrimination.
- The company ultimately shuts down, and the author quits the industry entirely.
- The author becomes concerned that the site he worked on, which generated controversial scenarios, has been used on the US, predicting specific events such as the Kavanaugh hearings and Colin Kaepernick's protests.
- The author questions whether this was a coincidence or if someone manipulated the scenarios to achieve a perfect match for specific events.
- The wave of responses to these scenarios creates deep, divisive, and damaging reactions.

Key learnings:
- A network designed for prediction can also function as a generative network.
- The maximally controversial statement can create powerful disagreement even among colleagues.
- The power of the maximally controversial statement can be harnessed as a potential weapon.
- Ethical considerations can be compromised in the pursuit of business goals.
- Legal trouble can arise from the misuse of controversial-creating networks.
- The creation of a perfect prediction by an online advertising company seems implausible, raising concerns about potential manipulation.
- The effect of Scissor statements' divisiveness can be damaging, polarizing people and causing conflict.

Key questions:
- What led the author to quit the industry entirely?
- What were the consequences of the legal troubles faced by company and employees?
- Could the maximally controversial statement be used for non-malicious purposes, such as facilitating debates or discussions?
- How can ethical considerations be balanced with business goals in the development of AI technologies?
- Who was generating Scissor statements in 2009, and how did they rise to such prominence?
- Is it possible to combat Scissor statements to prevent them from triggering people so deeply?
- Can society unite against these divisive statements, and how can we encourage radical compassion and charity?

# Preschool: I Was Wrong
*November 6, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/11/06/preschool-i-was-wrong/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Preschool does not improve academic ability or IQ, according to earlier studies.
- However, preschool has benefits in improving children's long-term life outcomes, such as staying in school longer, getting better jobs, and committing less crime.
- These benefits come from the social and economic advantages that preschool provides, such as freeing up low-income parents from childcare duties and socializing children into a "normal" way of life.
- The effectiveness of preschool highlights the difficulty in predicting policy effects.

Key learnings:
- Preschool is not beneficial for academic ability, but it has advantages in children's long-term life outcomes.
- Preschool's effectiveness comes from social and economic advantages.
- Shared environmental effects may matter more than previously thought in impacting life outcomes.

Key questions:
- If shared environment factors impact life outcomes more than previously thought, why do studies find little effect from shared environment?
- Can shared environment factors matter more when measuring non-cognitive factors and including the extremely poor?
- What are the implications for universal childcare and universal pre-K policies?

# SSRIs: An Update
*November 7, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/11/07/ssris-an-update/

## Summary
Key ideas:
-Scott talks about the low effect sizes of psychiatric medications, including SSRIs.
-He questions how the scientific evidence of medication efficacy can be reconciled with the clinical evidence of patients and psychiatrists reporting improvements with medication.
-Scott proposes the possibility that some individuals may have a genetic or personal characteristic that makes them more likely to respond to certain medications.
-He suggests that the benefit-to-side-effect ratio for each individual patient may be more important than the overall effect sizes reported in studies.

Key learnings:
-Medications for depression and anxiety often have very low effect sizes, including SSRIs.
-Patients and psychiatrists often report that these medications are helpful, even though the effect sizes are low.
-Some individuals may have a genetic or personal characteristic that makes them more likely to respond to certain medications.
-Individual benefit-to-side-effect ratios may be more important than overall effect sizes reported in studies.

Key questions:
-How can we reconcile the low effect sizes reported in studies with the clinical evidence of patients reporting improvements with medication?
-Is it possible that some individuals have a genetic or personal characteristic that makes them more likely to respond to certain medications?
-How should we weigh the benefit-to-side-effect ratio for each individual patient when considering medication options?

# Marijuana: An Update
*November 7, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/11/07/marijuana-an-update/

## Summary
Key ideas
- In 2015, the author reviewed the potential costs and benefits of marijuana legalization without concluding if it was positive or negative.
- The author predicted that legalization would decrease road traffic accidents; however, it seems he was wrong.
- According to an updated study from a Highway Loss Data Institute, states with legalized marijuana see an increase in auto insurance claims and road traffic accidents.
- The mature legal marijuana industry causes about a 5% increase in car crashes and fatalities.
- If the country legalizes, that would make about 1800 extra deaths per year.
- Marijuana taxes, spent intelligently, could easily save more lives than these accidents cost.

Key learnings
- Marijuana legalization can cause an increase in road traffic accidents.
- Marijuana taxes can be spent to save more lives than these accidents cost.

Key questions
- What are the effects of marijuana on chronic pain?
- Does marijuana cause uniquely non-fatal car accidents?
- Can marijuana cause cancer, like bacon does?
- How can marijuana taxes be spent intelligently?

# Ketamine: An Update
*November 8, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/11/08/ketamine-an-update/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Recent study finds naltrexone prevents ketamine's antidepressant effects, suggesting it works on the opiate system.
- Buprenorphine, an opiate painkiller, can relieve the distress of acutely suicidal patients and also has rapid-acting antidepressant effects.
- Ketamine's mode of action is more complicated than just the opiate system as it induces hallucinations and dissociation.
- The psychiatric establishment's response is that ketamine should not be abandoned but ketamine clinics under anaesthesiologists should be discouraged in favor of care monitored by psychiatrists.

Key learnings
- Depression might have some sort of a connection with opiates.
- Medicine has a habit of seizing on hopes that a less addictive version of an addictive thing is found, only to admit error once half the country is addicted to it.

Key questions
- Should we start thinking opiates have some deep connection to depression?
- Does ketamine cross-sensitize people to other opiates? 
- Does it increase some sort of domain-general addiction-having-center in the brain?

# Preschool: Much More Than You Wanted To Know
*November 13, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/11/13/preschool-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Randomized controlled trials have shown preschool doesn't improve test scores in the long-term.
- Early RCTs of intense preschool programs like the Perry Preschool Program and Abecedarians did have improved adult outcomes.
- There is no good RCT of Head Start yet.
- Recent studies on Head Start have shown mixed results.
- Deming (2009) found that Head Starters are 8% more likely to graduate high school than controls.
- Deming's study compared Head Starters to their control siblings.
- Deming's study showed that birth weight was the only significant difference between Head Starters and controls.
- A regression discontinuity experiment was conducted to test the effectiveness of Head Start programs in the 300 poorest counties in the US.
- The experiment found that Head Start improved the outcomes of certain easily preventable childhood diseases by 33-50%.
- Children from counties with Head Start programs were 5% more likely to finish high school than those in counties without Head Start programs.
- There are other similar preschool programs being tested around the world such as in Norway, Quebec and Chicago's Child Parent Centers.
- Many of the studies mentioned in the post found that Head Start has small effects for some specific subgroup on some specific outcome, making it hard to summarize all findings into 'Head Start works'.

Key learnings:
- The effectiveness of preschool, especially Head Start, in improving long-term outcomes is still up for debate.
- Studies that compare Head Starters to their control siblings have shown that Head Start provides some benefits, such as an 8% increase in high school graduation rates.
- The effectiveness of preschool programs such as Head Start are still a topic of debate and require further research.
- The findings of many studies on Head Start provide small positive effects for specific subgroups and outcomes, rather than a general 'Head Start works' statement.
- The quality of the daycare program plays a significant role in the effectiveness of early childhood education.

Key questions:
- What are the long-term effects of Head Start on life outcomes?
- How can we improve preschool education to ensure better long-term outcomes for children?
- How do socioeconomic factors affect the effectiveness of preschool programs?
- What is the quality of the Head Start program and how does it compare to other childcare programs?
- What kind of preschool program is suitable for a specific group of children?
- How can researchers ensure the validity of their study findings, especially in early childhood education where it is challenging to obtain conclusive results?

# The Economic Perspective On Moral Standards
*November 16, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/11/16/the-economic-perspective-on-moral-standards/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Some activists believe that nobody is morally acceptable and that merely trying to be a good person is not enough.
- "Good person" status is a social engineering question, not a philosophical one.
- Society needs to set targets for "good person" that are attainable and linked to incentives.
- Setting the bar for "good person" at a lower level than expected might be more effective.
- Having exceptions for exceptional people and for priorities such as curing cancer or AI alignment may be necessary.
- The strictest rule for animal rights is to reduce consumption of animal products but not necessarily cut it off
- There may be an objective morality that classifies the author as "scum"
- Price discrimination, where individuals "charge" themselves based on their willpower and personal preferences, can be a way for individuals to enforce their own moral standards

Key learnings:
- "Good person" status is subjective, with internal and external components.
- Goals and incentives are important for inducing people to behave in a certain way.
- Wise social engineering is necessary to set targets for "good person."
- It is important to have strict rules, but not so strict that they discourage further action
- Personal responsibility and choice in setting moral standards can be a powerful motivator
- It is difficult for companies or society as a whole to practice effective price discrimination, but individuals can do it on their own

Key questions:
- Is it possible to set the bar for "good person" too low, so that some people are freeloading off the efforts of others?
- Is there a way to enforce high standards on exceptional people without sabotaging incentives?
- What is the best way to set the bar for "good person" when priorities are in Extremistan?
- How can we determine what the strictest rule for animal rights is?
- Is there an objective morality? If so, what are its implications?
- How can individuals practice price discrimination on themselves to enforce their own moral standards?

# Links 11/18: MayflowURL
*November 20, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/11/20/links-11-18-mayflowurl/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The Perpetual Peace, a treaty signed by Byzantines and Persians, lasted only eight years, and The Fifty Year Peace lasted only ten years.
- Most state education rating systems rank state education success based on a combined measure of money spent as positive outcomes.
- Researchers are experimenting with archaeology techniques to learn more about ancient people.
- Researchers made progress in understanding how the brain holds faces.
- The Cochrane Collaboration has experienced scandal.
- A new crowdfunding site called Let’s Fund is available to support effective altruism.

Key learnings
- It is dangerous to make blanket policies on cyberbullying.
- The cost of raising the salary offered for a single position is much higher than X, as all existing employees would need their salaries raised as well.
- There are euphemisms for the word "bear" in many Indo-European languages due to a fear that speaking the true name may summon it.

Key questions
- What other treaties exist that were similarly named and designed to last indefinitely but failed to do so?
- Can state education ranking systems be improved to account for factors other than money?
- What are other ways researchers can experiment with archaeology?
- What implications does understanding how the brain holds faces have for the future of facial recognition technology?
- Can the Cochrane Collaboration recover from this scandal, and what does this mean for trustworthy research institutions?
- What other effective altruism crowdfunding sites exist, and how do they differ from Let's Fund?

# Is Science Slowing Down?
*November 26, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/11/26/is-science-slowing-down-2/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Bloom, Jones, Reenen & Webb (2018) measured the rate of progress in technological fields over the past century and the number of researchers in the field over the same period, and found that despite an exponential increase in researchers, progress has remained constant.
- BJRW argued that progress should scale with the number of researchers, and when they found this wasn’t the case, that progress might be harder than we previously thought.
- There are three potential explanations for this phenomenon: (1) only the best researchers in a field actually make progress, and the best researchers are already in a field, (2) certain features of the modern academic system have lowered productivity, or (3) all the low-hanging fruit has already been picked.
- Constant growth rates in response to exponentially increasing inputs is the null hypothesis.
- AI researchers predict that AIs will start being able to do science in about thirty years, and will exceed the productivity of human researchers in every field shortly afterwards.
- The effectiveness of academic conferences in promoting research and knowledge.
- The potential limitations of scientific knowledge and its effects on society.
- The idea of "Gods Of Straight Lines" and their potential impact on human progress.

Key learnings:
- Constant progress in scientific fields in response to exponentially increasing inputs should be the null hypothesis based on trends over the past century.
- The three potential explanations for why progress has slowed down in some fields today are: a small number of researchers are responsible for most progress, the modern academic system has lowered productivity, and there is no low-hanging fruit left.
- The importance of questioning the effectiveness of traditional academic practices.
- The potential dangers of scientific discovery and its effects on society.
- The need for continued study and examination of the impact of scientific progress.

Key questions:
- Isn't it unfair to compare percent increase in transistors with absolute increase in transistor scientists?
- Why aren’t researchers maintaining a constant level of output as measured in discoveries?
- What would happen if a concerted effort were made to "fix" the "problem" indicated by BJRW's trends?
- Doesn't the author's position imply that the scientists at Intel should give up and let the Gods Of Straight Lines do the work?
- Why has progress slowed down in some fields today?
- Are traditional academic practices, such as conferences, truly effective in promoting research and knowledge?
- What is the potential impact of scientific progress on society and how can it be harnessed for the greater good?
- How can we assess the impact of "Gods Of Straight Lines" on human progress and how can we mitigate any negative effects?

# Book Review: The Mind Illuminated
*November 28, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/11/28/book-review-the-mind-illuminated/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The Mind Illuminated is a guide to Buddhist meditation by Culadasa, a neuroscience PhD and Buddhist meditation teacher.
- The book focuses on concentration meditation divided into ten different stages.
- The book provides clear explanations of concepts and terminology using bolded italicized letters and a glossary.
- The book distinguishes between attention and awareness and provides instructions to incorporate both into meditation practice.
- The book presents a model of the mind as composed of many subminds, with consciousness acting as a neutral ground shared by all.
- Meditation involves bringing multiple sub-minds into a unified state.
- This leads to an increase in the degree of mindfulness and awareness.
- Meditation can result in a cessation event, which is a moment where consciousness ceases.
- The author supports the mind-system model presented in the book, which posits that the brain is composed of multiple sub-minds.
- The author suggests that the book's optimism differs from other meditation books.
- Experience can shape how people view medication/meditation side effects.
- A serious side effect is one that either you or your patients have had; minor side effects don't tend to factor into one's assessment of a medication's safety.
- Meditation can cause negative experiences, but they are typically rare and can be mitigated via guidance.
- A daily meditation practice may have fewer side effects than taking SSRIs.

Key learnings:
- The book provides solutions to common issues encountered in meditation, such as how to sustain concentration on the breath and how to incorporate awareness into meditation practice.
- The attention vs. awareness dichotomy clarifies instructions that were previously confusing and difficult to reconcile.
- Understanding the mind-system model helps to manage conflicts and inefficiencies that arise from having many subminds in the subconscious.
- Meditation can lead to a sense of unification among different sub-minds in the brain.
- An increase in mindfulness and awareness is possible with meditation.
- The cessation event is a powerful transformative experience.
- The mind-system model helps explain consciousness.
- The optimism presented in the book regarding the ability of individuals to achieve enlightenment is different from other meditation books.
- Experience can be powerful in shaping our opinions and perceptions.
- The severity of a side effect is subjective, based on personal experience.
- Meditation may be an alternative to SSRIs for some people.

Key questions:
- Can meditation guide and inform neuroscience as much as neuroscience can guide meditation?
- How can peripheral awareness coexist with the belief that there can only be one thing in consciousness at the same time?
- Is Culadasa's distinction between attention and awareness consistent with cognitive psychology and neuroscience research?
- What connection does Buddhist meditation have with global workspace theory?
- How does the mind-system model help explain meditation?
- Is it realistic to expect that most people can reach enlightenment within a few months or years with diligent practice?
- Can the risk of the Dark Night be effectively minimized through concentration meditation?
- How does Culadasa's type of meditation practice compare to other types such as "dry insight"?
- What factors contribute to the way people view medication side effects?
- How can we make objective assessments of a medication's safety?
- How can we minimize negative experiences during meditation practices?

# Book Review: Evolutionary Psychopathology
*December 3, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/12/03/book-review-evolutionary-psychopathology/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Evolutionary psychology and psychiatry can be combined to create a new field: Evolutionary Psychopathology.
- "Life history strategies" vary across species and within the human population.
- Fast life strategies are adapted to unpredictable, dangerous environments, while slow strategies are adapted to safer, masterable environments.
- Individual differences in traits, such as impulsivity, risk-taking, disgust sensitivity, and romantic attachment styles, are linked to fast vs. slow life history.
- Predisposition to fast vs. slow life history is caused by a gene-environment interaction.
- Four different life history strategies can be identified: antagonistic/exploitative, creative/seductive, prosocial/caregiving, and skilled/provisioning.
- Psychiatric disorders may be broken down into different conditions based on life strategies and adaptations.
- There are four categories of traits that can manifest as psychiatric disorders: maladaptations, adaptations that no longer work, extreme levels of adaptive traits, and failure modes of adaptive traits.
- Taxometrics, measuring correlation with mutational load, and evaluating evolutionary strategies can help determine which category a disorder falls into.
- Life history strategy theory explains different behavior patterns through evolutionary pressures.
- Life history strategies can be categorized into fast, slow, and unpredictable.
- Life history strategies may be influenced by childhood deprivation and dangerous environments.
- The theory can provide testable hypotheses for interventions.

Key learnings:
- Evolutionary Psychopathology sheds new light on psychiatric conditions by applying evolutionary and genetic ideas and "life history strategies."
- The fast vs. slow life history continuum influences individual differences in traits and behaviors, which can affect reproductive success.
- Environmental factors during prenatal development and early childhood can interact with genetic predispositions to "lock in" an individual to a faster or slower life history strategy and associated traits.
- The study of psychopathology is complex and difficult due to the wide range of factors that can contribute to psychiatric disorders.
- Life history theory offers a different perspective on the effects of childhood experiences on mental health.
- The fast-slow continuum can explain differences in the development of sexual behavior in adolescents.
- Life history strategy theory may be a new lens through which to understand behavior.
- It can provide comfort in understanding one's place in life's plan.

Key questions:
- How can the insights of Evolutionary Psychopathology be applied to understanding and treating psychiatric conditions?
- How can the gene-environment interaction be further studied to understand the development of life history strategies and associated traits?
- What are the implications of understanding psychiatric disorders through an evolutionary framework for stigma, treatment, and prevention?
- How can psychiatrists determine which category of trait a specific psychiatric disorder falls into?
- How can the fast-slow continuum explain differences in sexual behavior among adolescents?
- What are the political and social implications of del Giudice's work on psychiatric disorders and life history theory?
- Are life history strategies deterministic, or can they be changed through intervention?
- How do we balance the influence of genetics and environment in life history strategies?
- How can we use life history strategy theory to inform effective interventions?

# Del Giudice On The Self-Starvation Cycle
*December 5, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/12/05/giudice-on-the-self-starvation-cycle/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Anorexia has a cultural component but also has a biological component.
- The self-starvation cycle plays a crucial role in the onset of anorexia.
- The starvation response brings about psychological changes that contribute to the reinforcement of the cycle.

Key learnings
- Food restriction may be initially prompted by a variety of motives and involuntary weight loss due to physical illness can start the cycle.
- Increased physical activity is a key component of the starvation response in humans.
- Pride is a powerful additional reward of self-starvation - achieving extraordinary levels of thinness and self-control makes people feel special and superior.

Key questions
- How do we reconcile the cultural and biological components of anorexia?
- How does the "self-starvation cycle" operate and contribute to the onset of anorexia?
- Why do most people who starve not develop anorexia?

# Diametrical Model Of Autism And Schizophrenia
*December 11, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/12/11/diametrical-model-of-autism-and-schizophrenia/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Autism and schizophrenia are opposite but similar
- Schizophrenia and autism are two failure modes of opposing sides of a spectrum of high functioning schizotypy to high functioning autism
- Schizotypals have overly mentalistic cognition while autism is overly mechanistic cognition
- Autism and schizophrenia have several sensory and cognitive symptoms in common

Key learnings:
- The higher your mutational load is, the less well your brain is able to control its powerful abilities, leading to failure modes such as schizophrenia and autism
- High-functioning autism and high-functioning schizotypy may be good things to have, but the higher your mutational load is, the less well your brain is able to control these abilities

Key questions:
- How can high-functioning autism and high-functioning schizotypy be good things to have if they can still lead to failure modes?
- Can first-degree relatives of autists and schizophrenics, who have higher mechanistic cognition and higher mentalistic cognition and schizotypy respectively, still have normal cognitive functioning? 
- How can John Nash be schizophrenic if schizophrenia is about an imbalance in favor of verbal/personal and against logical/mathematical thinking?

# Trump: A Setback For Trumpism
*December 13, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/12/13/trump-a-setback-for-trumpism/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Polls from the past few years suggest that support for Trumpism's positions decreases across various issues as soon as Trump enters the national stage.
- Support for global free trade and moral support for immigrants unexpectedly spiked after the 2016 election.
- The European study found that support for the EU increased after Trump's election, suggesting a rally effect.
- Possible explanations for this trend are Trump's offensiveness, a shift in the Republican narrative, a focus shift by Democrats and the mainstream media, a goalpost shift, and the effects of disruptive protests.

Key learnings:
- Trump's aversiveness can harm his cause and cause backlash effects.
- Civility and honesty are not always pointless.
- People tend to overestimate the importance of turning out the base and underestimate the importance of not having everyone hate them.

Key questions:
- What are the possible mechanisms behind the trend of decreasing support for Trumpist positions?
- How can the effects of the European study be applied in other countries and contexts?
- What are the specific consequences of Trump's aversiveness on his cause and on the country as a whole?

# Fallacies Of Reversed Moderation
*December 18, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/12/18/fallacies-of-reversed-moderation/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- People often hold binary views on solutions to complex issues like climate change.
- Views that deviate from the popular consensus are often seen as extreme or immoderate.
- Reversed moderation happens when people reject an idea entirely instead of critically evaluating it.
- The importance of an issue or level of interest can also be moderated in reverse.

Key learnings:
- Moderation is not the same as "50-50" or "good"; it's about critically evaluating ideas.
- Reversed moderation makes it difficult to consider complex solutions to complex issues.
- People should not be afraid to challenge the popular consensus and suggest alternative ideas.

Key questions:
- Why do people tend to hold binary views on complex issues?
- How can we encourage people to critically evaluate solutions instead of dismissing them entirely?
- What can we do to combat the tendency towards reversed moderation in discussions and debates?

# Refactoring: Culture As Branch Of Government
*December 19, 2018*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/12/19/refactoring-culture-as-branch-of-government/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Refactoring involves a conceptual change in how you see the world.
- Culture can be considered the fourth branch of government.
- Each branch of government enforces rules in its own way, with cultural norms being set by the cultural branch.

Key learnings
- The world that considers culture the fourth branch of government doesn't get confused by differing governmental structures.
- Libertarianism aims to limit the imposition of cultural norms enforced by shame and ostracism.
- Debates about censorship, media, and immigration relate to who controls the cultural branch.

Key questions
- What does "refactoring" mean?
- How would culture be impacted if it were considered the fourth branch of government?
- Should cultural norms enforced by shame and ostracism be limited?

## Summary
Key ideas:
- A Swedish news team found the largest Viking treasure in history while filming a segment on amateur treasure-hunters.
- Remittance men were common enough in Old Western towns to make up a majority of some populations.
- GDP growth depends on population, capital, and productivity, with productivity growing in fits and starts that average out to appear smooth.
- Jonathan Wild, known as the “Thief-Taker General”, was secretly a mob boss who arranged crimes for his own benefit.
- The potential of gene editing for good outcomes is debated, evidenced by the Chinese CRISPR babies and differing opinions among scientists and the public.

- Scientists believe that Jeanne Calment, who died at the age of 122, was not the oldest person ever and that her daughter assumed her identity for financial reasons.

Key learnings:
- A coincidence may lead to unlikely discoveries, as demonstrated by the Swedish news team.
- Parts of history that may seem outdated, such as remittance men, can have lasting effects on modern populations.
- GDP growth is a complex phenomenon influenced by multiple factors.
- Even charismatic public figures can have insidious secrets, such as Jonathan Wild’s crimes.
- Gene editing has great potential but sparks ethical debates.
- School spending can make a difference in education outcomes.
- Monuments have the potential to offend groups of people.
- Hormones may affect other aspects of health but likely do not significantly impact decision-making.
- Popular medications may have unintended consequences on cognition.
- Some may argue that trying to find common ground with political enemies is not worth the effort.
- Truths we accept as fact may be false, such as the age of Jeanne Calment.

Key questions:
- Can coincidences be harnessed for more unlikely discoveries?
- How have historical practices and figures left a lasting impact on current populations and systems?
- How can we reconcile the complicated factors that contribute to GDP growth?
- Can people in power always be trusted, or may they have hidden selfish motives?

# What Happened To 90s Environmentalism?
*January 1, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/01/01/what-happened-to-90s-environmentalism/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The decline of 90s environmentalism has led to a lack of concern about issues such as air and water pollution, acid rain, and rainforest destruction.
- Environmentalists successfully addressed air and water pollution through legislation and decreased emissions.
- The issue of acid rain was partially solved through emissions reductions, but its effects still linger in some ecosystems.
- The state of the world's rainforests is difficult to evaluate, but some data suggests that they are decreasing in size.
- Environmental concerns from the 90s are addressed one by one, and their veracity is investigated
- Concerns of deforestation, endangered species, peak resources, trash piling up, and saving the whales are discussed
- The author uses examples, data, and verifiable sources to determine the validity of each environmental issue
- The author reflects on how some environmental issues that were once alarmingly real seem to have faded away without any definitive solutions.
- The author questions whether the shift in public opinion came from top-down or bottom-up processes.
- The author wonders whether climate change has cannibalized focus on other environmental problems.

Key learnings:
- Environmental movements can successfully solve some problems, but it may lead to a lack of concern around the issue.
- Some environmental issues have been exaggerated, which can lead to misguided efforts.
- Deforestation still exists as a problem, with Southeast Asia showing no significant decrease
- The issue of endangered species could be partly alarmist, as many species extinction rates are lower than believed
- The worry of the Earth becoming a mountain of trash is alarmist and no longer considered a significant problem
- Peak resource concerns have been put to rest due to new extraction technologies
- Whaling is reducing, but indigenous peoples and certain countries still permit it
- Environmental issues are constructed and the mapping from real crisis to social panic is tenuous, contingent, and historical.
- Just because an environmental issue fades away doesn't mean it has been solved or debunked.
- Public attention often moves on from environmental issues after a decade or so.

Key questions:
- What other environmental issues have been affected by the decline of 90s environmentalism?
- How can environmentalists communicate the urgency of issues without resorting to alarmism?
- Is public concern necessary for environmental issues to be addressed effectively?
- How can we raise awareness of world issues without resorting to alarmism?
- What steps can we take to address deforestation in Southeast Asia and preserve endangered species?
- How can we ensure that global consensus and regulations against whaling are enforced and upheld?
- How did non-environmental problems fade away, and why have these made-up environmental issues, which never had an intellectual defeat, lost public attention over time?
- Was the change bottom-up, or did the intellectuals initiate it?
- Has public attention on global warming cannibalized other environmental issues?

# Preregistration Of Investigations For The 2019 SSC Survey
*January 4, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/01/04/preregistration-of-investigations-for-the-2019-ssc-survey/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The post is about the 2019 SSC Survey
- Scott proposes 18 different questions to analyze in the survey

Key learnings:
- The post doesn't provide any specific key learnings

Key questions:
- Can we confirm or disconfirm different corn-eating profiles of algebraists vs. analysts?
- Can we replicate the study showing that people who eat more beef jerky are more likely to be hospitalized for bipolar mania?
- Are there differences in side effects among SSRIs?
- Is there a difference in people’s efficacy ratings for SSRIs depending on whether the person was taking the SSRI for depression vs. for anxiety?
- What percent of people coming off SSRIs experience discontinuation symptoms?
- Are people more likely to attribute success to hard work/talent rather than luck if they are from a higher childhood social class?
- Are people less likely to support psychiatric commitment if they have been committed themselves?
- Is there any support for the idea of life history strategies?
- Do paternal and maternal age correlate with risk of the psychiatric disorders?
- Can we replicate the claim that people who had a younger sibling born during a supposed critical window for sexual imprinting are more exposed to baby-related issues during that window and so are more likely to have baby-related fetishes?
- Is there a difference between STEM/nerdy/male vs. interpersonal/creative/female occupations in the rate at which people perceive gender bias?
- How does imposter syndrome vary by gender, field, and gender * field?
- Do schizophrenics (and their families) smoke more? Do autistics (and their families) smoke less?
- Are schizophrenics (and their families) more likely to be able to tickle themselves than others? What about autistics (and their families)? What about people who have used lots of psychedelics?
- Is tendency to prefer great literature to sci-fi/fantasy mediated by ability to perceive and appreciate complex emotion?
- Do people with ADHD habituate to stimuli more or less quickly?
- Do the birth order effects discovered in the last survey disappear if there’s a sufficient age gap between someone and their next youngest sibling, or remain equally strong?

# Book Review: The Structure Of Scientific Revolutions
*January 8, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/01/08/book-review-the-structure-of-scientific-revolutions/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Science is not just about the accumulation of facts, but the use of paradigms to guide research
- Paradigms are whole ways of looking at the world that determine what facts are gathered, how they are collected, and how they are processed
- Two paradigms may not address the same questions or even care about the same kinds of answers
- Paradigms often appear to be facts, which makes it difficult to shift to a new paradigm
- Thomas Kuhn's book "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions" explores how scientific paradigms shift over time.
- Paradigms are collections of assumptions, methods, and definitions that guide scientific inquiry.
- Kuhn argues that paradigms are not objective or based solely on evidence, but are shaped by social and historical factors.
- Paradigm shifts occur when an old paradigm becomes inadequate and a new paradigm emerges, often by solving problems the old paradigm could not.
- A psychological experiment involving cards suggests that our prior experience and categories influence how we perceive and identify things.
- This experiment may provide a schema for scientific discovery and paradigms.
- Scientists may behave similarly to the participants in the card experiment when faced with anomalies.

Key learnings:
- Scientific progress is not just about accumulating facts, but about shifting from one paradigm to another
- The use of paradigms leads to progress in science, but also makes it difficult to change paradigms
- A paradigm shift often appears as facts being replaced or modified, not as a clear-cut decision based on a single experiment
- Science is not a purely objective process and is influenced by social and historical factors.
- Paradigms are collections of assumptions, methods, and definitions that guide scientific inquiry.
- Paradigm shifts occur when an old paradigm becomes inadequate and a new paradigm emerges, often by solving problems the old paradigm could not.
- Our prior experience and categories affect how we perceive things.
- Paradigms may be inherent in perception and shape scientific discovery.
- Adjusting to anomalies can be difficult and distressing.

Key questions:
- How does science settle on a single paradigm when other fields can't?
- Is Aristotelian philosophy a science, and would it become one if all philosophers fell in line behind Aristotle?
- Two paradigms may not even address or care about the same questions. So, how do scientists work with paradigms in fields like philosophy or ethics?
- How do scientists determine when a paradigm shift is necessary?
- What factors influence the emergence of a new paradigm?
- Can objective facts exist independently of paradigms?
- How do paradigms shape scientific inquiry and the interpretation of data?
- What are the limitations and drawbacks of paradigms in scientific research?
- How might the predictive coding model be related to Kuhn's ideas about paradigms?
- How else might paradigms affect scientific discovery?
- How can scientists adjust to new anomalies and paradigms without becoming too distressed?

# Paradigms All The Way Down
*January 10, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/01/10/paradigms-all-the-way-down/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The process of interpreting the world involves a combination of pre-existing ideas and actual experiences
- The interaction between facts and theories is bidirectional, and theory determines what facts are noticed
- Ideological change does not result from debunking one fact but rather from a paradigm shift or crisis of faith
- The structure used for interpreting the world is built into basic algorithms used by the brain

Key learnings:
- The structure used to interpret the world involves pre-existing ideas and experiences
- A theory determines what facts are noticed, and ideology does not change easily
- The brain uses certain algorithms for epistemology

Key questions:
- Why is the bidirectionality of facts and theories so important?
- What role do pre-existing ideas play in shaping our interpretation of the world?
- How do we effectively navigate paradigm shifts or crises of faith in order to change our ideology or theories?

# Too Many People Dare Call It Conspiracy
*January 14, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/01/14/too-many-people-dare-call-it-conspiracy/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- There are many hypotheses labeled as conspiracy theories, leading to discussions over when the phrase is appropriate to use.
- The Basic Argument Against Conspiracy Theories is that large organizations cannot be kept secret without being noticed from the inside or outside.
- Organizations can coordinate activities without being considered conspiracies if they are in line with their public-facing mission statement or stated interests.
- Some conspiracies might be plausible, but they must violate fewer heuristics or assumptions than theories like the Illuminati.
- The replication crisis in science shows that many claims made in scientific studies are not true.
- The reasons why so many false results are published include publication bias, statistical power bias, and researcher degrees of freedom.
- Researchers and institutions can coordinate on perpetuating false results and subtle biases without the need for explicit conspiracy.

Key learnings:
- Labeling ideas as conspiracy theories can lead to debates over terminology and sideline discussions that ignore substantive evidence.
- The Basic Argument Against Conspiracy Theories can offer a useful heuristic for evaluating the evidence of conspiracy theories.
- Organizations can make decisions or act in a coordinated fashion without necessarily conspiring to do so.
- Many scientific studies are not replicable and can be driven by biases and other factors.
- Publication bias, statistical power, and researcher degrees of freedom have significant impacts on scientific studies' validity.
- Subtle biases can persist in scientific studies without explicit coordination among researchers or institutions.

Key questions:
- How can we distinguish between a plausible conspiracy theory and one that violates too many heuristics or assumptions?
- What are the major heuristics or assumptions we might use to evaluate conspiracy theories?
- Are there cases where organizations may be coordinating in ways that resemble a conspiracy without violating the assumptions of the Basic Argument Against Conspiracy Theories?
- What factors contribute to the non-replicability of scientific studies?
- How can researchers and institutions overcome biases in their studies and publications?
- What are the ethical implications of perpetuating false results and subtle biases in scientific research?

# Kernel Of Doubt: Testing Math Preference Vs. Corn-Eating Style
*January 15, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/01/15/kernel-of-doubt-testing-math-preference-vs-corn-eating-style/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Mathematicians can be divided into those who prefer analysis and those who prefer algebra.
- Ben Tilly wrote a blog post in which he claimed that analysts ate corn in rows and algebraists ate corn in spirals.
- The author conducted a survey to test Tilly's claim, but found no significant difference between mathematicians who preferred algebra and those who preferred analysis in the way they ate corn.
- The author also analyzed his data by gender, race, ethnicity, subethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, social class, neurotype, and political affiliation, but found no clear patterns in the way different groups ate corn.

Key learnings:
- The connection between the type of mathematics a person prefers and the way they eat corn is likely not as strong as previously claimed.
- It is difficult to determine why certain groups of people eat corn in certain ways.

Key questions:
- Why did Ben Tilly's observation that algebraists eat corn in spirals and analysts eat corn in rows receive so much attention?
- Are there other examples of seemingly unrelated preferences or behaviors that are connected?
- Why do some groups of people eat corn in rows while others eat corn in spirals?

# Highlights From The Comments On Kuhn
*January 17, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/01/17/highlights-from-the-comments-on-kuhn/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Kuhn's book, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, has been influential but also has its flaws.
- The issue of Kuhn's relativism and attitude towards objectivity is still debated.
- Kuhn's approach to reading outdated scientific texts highlights the importance of understanding the historical context and meaning of specialized terms.
- Predictive coding can be used to reduce redundancy in communication and information transmission, and can be applied to understanding paradigms in science.
- Normal science involves constructing explanations based on exemplars, and solving puzzles within a paradigm.
- Paradigms in science are internally coherent and insulated from each other, making it impossible to mix them outside of a particular paradigm.
- However, in real life, concepts are often vague and meaningfully different, making it possible to compare and reconcile paradigms to some extent.
- Kuhn's ideas in "TSOSR" are valuable as they create a new space (a spectrum) but it's important to remember they are only one pole and not the entire space.
- Scientists abandon the "old skyscraper" for a bigger and better one with a stronger foundation, with the overall history of science being the successive abandonment of these "skyscrapers."
- Kuhn's theory of paradigm shifts in science
- The difference between normal science and revolutionary science
- The limitations and subjectivity of the scientific method
- The influence of external social, political, and cultural factors on scientific institutions

Key learnings:
- To understand Kuhn's book, it's important to understand the state of philosophy of science at the time it was written and the progress that has been made since then.
- Kuhn's idea of incommensurability between paradigms means that statements about the falsity of something can only be made within a certain paradigm.
- The use of predictive coding highlights how redundancy can help compensate for errors in communication and how it can be applied to understanding paradigms in science.
- Changing paradigms can impose their respective structures on the world.
- There is still a mind-independent reality that in some way determines how things appear to us and constrains how successful a given paradigm can be.
- The scope, accuracy, and detail of the scientific project ultimately depends on the soundness of the underlying model.
- The limits of current scientific theories and paradigms should be continuously pushed and challenged
- Science is not an objective set of data but a social and cultural institution
- The success of a scientific experiment is highly dependent on the underlying assumptions, paradigms, and cosmologies

Key questions:
- What is the distinction between schools and paradigms in science?
- How can the understanding of historic context and specialized terminology affect the interpretation of scientific texts?
- How can Kuhn's notion of incommensurability be applied to current debates in science?
- Can predictive coding offer insights into other domains besides science?
- How can scientists reconcile and compare paradigms despite their different structures?
- Are Kuhn's ideas valuable in describing science or are they an overinterpretation?
- How can we differentiate between flaws in the new building and necessary scaffolding for a bigger and better building?
- How can the scientific method account for paradigm shifts when it is focused on falsification and verification?
- What are the limitations of our current scientific paradigm in explaining and understanding the world?
- To what extent are external factors like culture, politics, and economics influencing scientific inquiry and research?

# Book Review: Zero To One
*January 31, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/01/31/book-review-zero-to-one/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Zero To One is a book on entrepreneurship.
- It discusses how entrepreneurs bring something “from 0 to 1” instead of “from 1 to n” like most businessmen.
- Three sections of the book, especially striking are the sections on monopolies, secrets, and indefinite optimism.
- Book argues that a successful startup requires a definite goal, specific strategy, and the vision to achieve it.
- Long-term planning and conspiracies can be successful in business.
- The modern belief in indefinite optimism makes people doubtful of existing plans, which results in the preference for finance over engineering and investments in the market rather than in actual wealth-creating activities.
- Contrarianism is essential to finding ways to violate the efficient market hypothesis.
- Being weird does not automatically make you contrarian or interesting.
- Truly weird people have an advantage in a society where everyone is trying to be weird.
- Weirdness can be a skill, but it requires practice.
- Founders of successful companies are often unconventional and strange.

Key learnings:
- An important way for entrepreneurs to succeed is to create a monopoly.
- There are four ways to enter monopolyhood: proprietary technology, network effects, economies of scale, and branding.
- Monopolies provide advantages like being better for employees, socially responsible, and able to engage in long-term thinking.
- The loss of belief in secrets, especially by a culture that mocks stories of lone genius, hinders entrepreneurship.
- The belief that it's impossible to predict anything in the long-term and that options are essential to be successful is a misconception.
- Planning and conspiracies, when executed well, are essential to achieving significant milestones and long-term goals.
- A society that values indefinite optimism leads to the ineffectiveness of government and finance.
- It's important to be interestingly contrarian and correct, not just randomly weird.
- To truly stand out, you need to be authentically weird.
- Thinking outside of the box is a valuable skill that requires practice.
- Founders of companies are often eccentric and unconventional.

Key questions:
- How can entrepreneurs achieve monopolyhood in a fair and ethical way?
- In what ways is the loss of belief in secrets detrimental to potential entrepreneurs?
- Can companies have a balance between monopoly profits and ethics?
- Is an indefinite, optionality-focused worldview less successful than one with a definite goal?
- Should entrepreneurs be more willing to embrace risk and engage in conspiracies in order to be successful?
- How can society effectively balance the need for innovation and the value of tradition?
- When does being weird become random versus contrarian?
- Can anyone learn to be weird, or is it a natural inclination?
- How does being weird translate to business success?
- Why do unconventional and strange individuals make good founders?

# Respectability Cascades
*February 4, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/04/respectability-cascades/

## Summary
Key ideas: 
- A cascade of increasing respectability contributed to the success of the gay rights movement. 
- In contrast, when 0% respectable people take up a cause, it can doom it forever via a disrespectability cascade. 
- The author considers how these opposite theories apply to current political and social issues, including the fight to protect scientific integrity.

Key learnings:
- The visibility and likeability of a group or issue might impact the success of a respectability cascade.
- The initial taboo level of a cause might also impact its susceptibility to a disrespectability cascade.
- There are divergent opinions on whether suppressing or elevating the voices of 0% respectable people is the best strategy.

Key questions:
- What heuristics can we rely on to predict when one approach to a respectability cascade is more likely than the other?
- Should people in positions of power, such as Jonathan Haidt, tell random disrespectable anti-SJW Twitter trolls to shut up or to shout louder?
- How can we balance the need for respectability with the need for grassroots movements and advocacy?

# Survey Results On SSRIs
*February 6, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/06/survey-results-on-ssris/

## Summary
Key Ideas:
- SSRIs are widely used for various psychiatric conditions and have been extensively studied, but much is still unknown.
- A survey of 2,090 people on SSRIs finds that most believe the drugs work and that some SSRIs work better than others.
- The survey suggests that SSRIs may work better for anxiety than depression and that sexual difficulties, emotional blunting, and fatigue are the most common side effects.
- The survey also finds that discontinuing SSRIs can be difficult, especially when done abruptly, but most people are eventually successful.

Key Learnings:
- The most helpful antidepressants are likely to be Lexapro and Prozac, with a slight edge for Lexapro in effectiveness and Prozac in ease of discontinuation.
- People on SSRIs for anxiety tend to benefit more than those on them for depression. 
- Common side effects of SSRIs include sexual difficulties, emotional blunting, and fatigue.
- Discontinuation syndrome is a common issue among people who stop taking SSRIs abruptly.
 
Key Questions:
- Do SSRIs work better for certain types of anxiety compared to others? 
- Why do SSRIs cause sexual difficulties, emotional blunting and cognitive difficulties?
- Why are some SSRIs easier to discontinue than others? 
- What is the requirement for SSRIs to work effectively?

# The Proverbial Murder Mystery
*February 13, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/13/the-proverbial-murder-mystery/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Dr. Zachary LaShay is the director of the United States' only proverb laboratory, which provides rigorous backing for good proverbs and weeds out the bad ones
- The laboratory is a consulting firm that uses reports to provide justification for business executives and high-ranking officials to rely on proverbs and heuristics
- Lisa Bird, a sysadmin, and Catherine Lee, who took care of the animals, were the two victims in a murder-suicide, but Bird's heart and tongue are missing
- LaShay shows Detective Paul Eastman, who is investigating the murders, an enormous, radioactive machine used to test all possible machine-related proverbs
- Dr. Rissum, LaShay's colleague and the co-founder of the laboratory, committed suicide by jumping into the machine nine years ago.
- Proverb Laboratory is not a normal laboratory that investigates proverbs, but an experiment that tests the Machine - a device that makes proverbs real.
- Dr. LaShay has been secretly testing the Machine's capacities, relying on its invisible force for reality-bending to make proverbs come true.
- Scott has to navigate through different proverbs to escape from Dr. LaShay and his agents
- Scott tricks LaShay into falling into the Machine and defeats him by using the proverb "for want of a nail, the horseshoe was lost"
- The military shuts down the Proverb Laboratory, and the second Machine is found and destroyed
- Catherine Lee is declared not responsible for Lisa Bird's murder due to her influence by the Machine

Key learnings:
- The proverb laboratory is a vital asset to the United States as an entire country uses proverbs
- The laboratory uses reports to give justification for the use of proverbs and heuristics in high-stress situations
- The mysterious deaths of Lisa Bird and Catherine Lee could be linked to the large, radioactive machine tested by Dr. Rissum
- The laboratory is an incredibly vast area with several different units testing various proverbs
- Catherine Lee has murdered Lisa Bird by smashing her head with one of the gemstone paperweights she brought home, then brought Lisa's tongue and heart home, as the Machine has forced her to do so.
- Catherine Lee's corpse vanished from the body bag because of the Machine's malevolent radiation, and it has been absorbed by her for years.
- Dr. LaShay is still a member of the English Defense League and has arranged the murders and disappearance to guarantee Lisa's death, to keep the experiment going.
- Proverbs can be useful in different situations, but they can also be dangerous if misinterpreted or used wrongly
- The consequences of scientific experimentation and innovation can be severe if they fall into the wrong hands
- Courage and quick thinking can help in dangerous situations, but they must be accompanied by careful planning and decision-making

Key questions:
- Where are Lisa Bird's heart and tongue?
- Is there any connection between Dr. Rissum's suicide and the deaths of Bird and Lee?
- What other experiments and projects are being tested in the laboratory?
- What was Dr. LaShay's motivation for showing Eastman the enormous, radioactive machine?
- Who has arranged for a paranoid woman living in a glass house to be on the spot, placed Bird on the hand-chair, and given Lee the stone paperweights as presents?
- How will the experiment be stopped, and Dr. LaShay and his accomplices be brought to justice?
- Can the use of proverbs be regulated or standardized to prevent malicious or unethical use?
- What are the long-term effects of exposure to radiation from scientific experimentation?
- What responsibility do researchers have in ensuring that their innovations are used for good?

# GPT-2 As Step Toward General Intelligence
*February 19, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/19/gpt-2-as-step-toward-general-intelligence/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- GPT-2 is a machine learning model that can build concepts from human-written text and generate new text based on those concepts.
- The model has demonstrated abilities in counting, acronymizing, translating languages, and summarizing text, although it is not perfect at any of them.
- The author argues that humans and GPT-2 alike blend experience into a "slurry" to create something new, with the difference being the level of fineness and spices added.
- GPT-2 learned to count and acronymize words, and can predict the next word in text with high accuracy.
- GPT-2-like processes are closer to human thinking than previously thought.
- GPT-2 works like the brain, learning all sorts of things without guidance.
- Prediction is the key to learning, and GPT-2 can learn any pattern if given enough training data and computational resources.
- AGI is not impossible and can emerge from current work with unexpected abilities.

Key learnings:
- GPT-2 can develop specific faculties or skills naturally from its pattern recognition and word prediction ability.
- The model does not have deep understandings or reasoning abilities like humans (yet), but it can learn and improve with more training data and computational resources.
- The model's abilities are not programmed in, but rather emerge from its training data and prompt instructions.
- GPT-2 is capable of learning patterns without explicit guidance, which shows the value of unsupervised learning.
- Prediction is an important ability for an AGI, as it allows for the learning of any pattern.
- The limits of language determine the limits of our understanding of reality.
- The development of AGI is not impossible, but it will require significantly more capabilities than current AI models possess.

Key questions:
- Can GPT-2 develop further abilities or faculties beyond what it has demonstrated so far?
- How do humans compare to GPT-2 in terms of blending experience and creating something new?
- Are there potential ethical concerns with GPT-2's ability to generate convincing fake text?
- How will AGI be able to learn from limited datasets with limited computational resources?
- What does it mean for an AI to have a model of what it means to act in the world?
- What other capabilities would AGI require beyond the ones possessed by GPT-2?

# My Plagiarism
*February 21, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/21/my-plagiarism/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Plagiarism can be classified as careless, slightly cautious, more cautious, and very cautious.
- The deeper the understanding of the underlying concept, the more the text departs from plagiarism.
- Writers blend the things they read into their writing, resulting in a "slurry," and that's quite normal.

Key learnings
- Blending distinct experiences of literature is essential to create a unique style of writing, but that doesn't necessarily mean inserting someone else's words without perfect attribution.
- It is possible to use someone else's work as inspiration in your writing, but you must transform it into your words.
 
Key questions
- What are the implications of unintentional plagiarism?
- How can one transform others' work into their words and make it unique?
- What are some excellent methods to keep from unconsciously plagiarizing?

https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/22/rip-culture-war-thread/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The r/slatestarcodex subreddit created a thread for culture war topics and successfully corralled those discussions away from the rest of the board.
- Despite initial concerns, the culture war thread became a community with some impressive analysis and changed minds.
- The thread aimed to be a place where people with different views could come together to talk and learn from each other.
- The demographics of the thread were fairly balanced in terms of political affiliation, but skewed towards the fringes.
- Despite its flaws, the thread was a rare space where people of different views engaged with each other respectfully.
- Online comment sections can attract unpopular and taboo opinions, which can damage a brand's reputation and provide ammunition for enemies.
- A personal experience is shared of the Culture War thread on the r/slatestarcodex subreddit attracting negative attention and leading to harassment.
- The author proposed spinning off the thread to a new forum unaffiliated with their brand and subreddit, and it was eventually closed forever.
- Speaking up is crucial to break the double-bind pattern of fear and censorship.
- Scott apologizes for becoming a worse person due to the backlash of the controversial topics he discusses in his blog.
- There are some bright spots despite the unmitigated disaster, including the survival of Culture War thread and its new home, r/TheMotte.

Key learnings:
- It is possible to host a space for political discussion on the internet with effective moderation.
- The real challenge comes when people start engaging in civil and honest debate about controversial topics.
- Hosting a space for public discourse comes with risks and requires careful consideration of potential consequences.
- Unpopular opinions can be manipulated and used against individuals and brands.
- Anonymity can be a useful tool for protecting oneself and a community from repercussions of hosting controversial conversations.
- Speaking up and taking ownership of one's fear and cowardice can inspire others to do the same.
- One can become a worse person when constantly dealing with backlash and negative comments.
- It's important to have control over when and where to deal with controversial topics to avoid being associated with other people's opinions.

Key questions:
- Why have so many major news sources closed their comments sections in recent years?
- Can comments sections be moderated effectively without completely shutting down discussion on controversial topics?
- How can we create more spaces for civil and respectful political discourse online?
- How can individuals and brands mitigate risks associated with hosting online conversations?

# Wage Stagnation: Much More Than You Wanted To Know
*February 25, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/25/wage-stagnation-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Wage decoupling refers to the disconnection between median wages and productivity since 1973.
- Data shows that this is not always the case for other countries and time periods, but the modern decoupling is significant.
- Some argue that apparent wage stagnation is due to compensation in benefits such as health insurance, but data suggests otherwise.
- Changing demographics and inflation measurement have also been proposed as explanations, but their significance is uncertain.
- Labor vs capital inequality may offer a potential explanation.
- Labor-vs-capital inequality is about how much wage earners earn vs. how much capitalists get in profits.
- The tech industry is more capital-intensive, which causes capital's share of the pie to go up.
- Increased wage inequality and policy changes are significant contributors to wage stagnation and decoupling.
- Contrary to popular belief, wages have not stagnated since 1973.
- Measurement issues have made things look worse than they actually are.
- There is a 50% real decoupling between median wages and productivity.
- Increasing wage inequality is the most important factor, with increasing labor-capital inequality also contributing.
- Increasing wage inequality is likely due to taxation and corporate governance policies, as well as deunionization to some extent.
- Automation and globalization also play a smaller role in wage inequality.

Key learnings:
- Wage decoupling is a complex issue with no clear consensus on a single factor causing it.
- Technical points about inflation could explain a significant portion of the wage stagnation phenomenon.
- Labor vs. capital inequality has been suggested as another potential explanation.
- Labor-vs-capital inequality explains 10-20% of decoupling since 2000.
- Increased wage inequality explains 20-47% of wage stagnation and decoupling.
- Technology may explain moderately better pay for the top 10%, but it doesn't explain the stratospheric increase in the share of the 1%.
- Median wages have probably risen 40-50% since 1973.
- Inflation miscalculations, wages vs. total compensation, labor vs. capital inequality, deunionization, policies permitting high executive salaries, globalization, and automation all contribute to wage decoupling.

Key questions:
- Is there a consensus on the primary cause of wage decoupling?
- How significant are the technical points regarding inflation in explaining wage stagnation?
- How can policymakers address wage decoupling, particularly in response to the potential impact of labor vs capital inequality?
- Why is labor-vs-capital inequality increasing?
- Is wage inequality increasing because of technology?
- Is wage inequality increasing because of policy changes?
- How much should we care about the difference between inflation indices?
- Who is right about the estimate of how much of the gap inconsistent deflators explain?
- Does the Summers & Stansbury paper argue against policy-based wage inequality as a cause of median wage stagnation, at least until 2000?
- Are there enough high-paid executives at companies whose money would have increased significantly more in step with productivity if redistributed to all employees?
- What caused past episodes of wage decoupling in the US, and what ended them?
- How do we square the apparent multifactorial nature of wage decoupling with its sudden beginning in 1973 and with the general argument against multifactorial trends?

# Rule Thinkers In, Not Out
*February 26, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/26/rule-genius-in-not-out/

## Summary
Key ideas
- A black box that generates scientific hypotheses with a failure rate would be highly valuable.
- Genius involves coming up with outrageous ideas, pursuing them despite critics and failing sometimes.
- Hypersensitivity to patterns can lead to both exceptional genius and exceptionally egregious mistakes.
- Geniuses are similar to black boxes with a certain failure rate, and their failures can be easily discarded.
- Positive selection should be practiced for geniuses, where one good call rules them in instead of negative selection where one bad call rules them out.

Key learnings
- A genuinely original idea is rare, and someone who comes up with a single good original idea is a better use of time than someone who reliably never gets anything too wrong.
- Respecting someone in the idea industry is not a relevant predicate, as they are a black box who occasionally spits out ideas to evaluate.
- Intellectual exploration is a different job than promoting the right opinions about things.

Key questions
- What if the black box had only a 10% or 1% success rate?
- Are some of the examples of geniuses with terrible ideas unforgivably bad?
- What are the different strategies required for intellectual exploration and promoting the right opinions about things?
- What is the difference between moral outrage culture and intellectual outrage culture?

*February 28, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/28/meaningful/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- An AI can understand relationships between words, but not necessarily have a concept of reality.
- Humans also understand relationships between things and make predictions, but may not necessarily understand the underlying reality.
- There may be deeper levels of understanding humans are incapable of accessing.

Key learnings:
- Our understanding is based on relationships between things, not necessarily on a direct understanding of reality.
- Even if we only have a statistical or abstract understanding, it is still impressive that we can get that far.

Key questions:
- How can we distinguish between a statistical or abstract understanding and an understanding of reality?
- Are there really deeper levels of understanding that humans are incapable of accessing?

# Ketamine: Now By Prescription
*March 11, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/03/11/ketamine-now-by-prescription/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The pharmaceutical industry patents new drugs after spending tens of millions of dollars on FDA trials.
- Traditional antidepressants like SSRI's have been clinically proven to have marginal positive effects.
- Due to the cost of FDA trials, potentially life changing medication like ketamine has failed to be approved until recently.
- The FDA recently approved a new anti-depressant called esketamine.
- The approval of esketamine has been controversial, and there are concerns regarding its efficacy and potential for addiction.
- Patients will have to go to specially trained clinics to get the drug, which is an inconvenience that negates the benefits of a ketamine nasal spray.

Key learnings
- Patients seeking ketamine for depression should gravitate towards intravenous racemic ketamine at existing ketamine clinics.
- As of the writing of the post, the efficacy of esketamine is questionable.
- If psilocybin is approved for treating depression, it will likely fall into the same trap of being overpriced and difficult to obtain.

Key questions
- Does esketamine work as an antidepressant at all?
- Is there a better way to bring potentially life-changing medication to market without relying on the slow, expensive FDA trial process?
- Would it be possible to streamline the process of getting patients access to drugs like ketamine, should insurance start covering it?
- Is it ethical for the FDA to require patients seeking to use potentially beneficial or life-changing drugs like ketamine or psilocybin to go to specialized clinics?

# Puritan Spotting
*March 12, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/03/12/puritan-spotting/

## Summary
Key Ideas:
- The author defines a category he calls "Puritan", which involves characteristics such as being eccentric, over-educated, hyper-competent, contrarian, and taking morality seriously. 
- The author provides a humorous Puritan checklist as a way of ranking historical figures by Puritanism points.
- The author argues that the modern American stereotype of the impulsive, gun-crazy, fundamentalist hillbilly has eclipsed the stereotype of the virtue-obsessed nonconformist eccentric inventor philanthropist.

Key Learnings:
- The Puritan category is difficult to define in a concise way, but involves a range of characteristics related to morality and non-conformity.
- The Puritan checklist can be used to rank famous historical figures in terms of their Puritanism points, based on their life circumstances and achievements.
- The stereotype of the eccentric inventor philanthropist has largely disappeared and is not part of the US national identity.

Key Questions:
- What other categories exist that are similar to the one described as "Puritan"?
- How might the emphasis on the stereotype of the impulsive, gun-crazy, fundamentalist hillbilly affect national identity in the US?
- Are the categories used to rank historical figures by Puritanism points arbitrary or does the author use specific criteria?

# Does Reality Drive Straight Lines On Graphs, Or Do Straight Lines On Graphs Drive Reality?
*March 13, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/03/13/does-reality-drive-straight-lines-on-graphs-or-do-straight-lines-on-graphs-drive-reality/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Graphs of historic trends can be used to argue that policies like the Clean Air Act didn't work.
- These arguments can be countered by considering control systems, which adjust to any unexpected advances/changes to achieve the desired outcomes.
- Control systems exist in various aspects of life, including environmental outcomes and technological progress.
- It is challenging to tell whether changes in trends are due to policies or control systems.

Key learnings
- Graphs of trends over time can be misleading and should be considered with caution, especially when used to argue against the effectiveness of policies.
- Control systems, which adjust to changes, should be considered when evaluating trends and the effectiveness of policies.
- Changes in trends can be due to policies, control systems or other factors that are difficult to discern, which makes it challenging to determine the effectiveness of policies.

Key questions
- Are control systems prevalent everywhere or only in specific aspects of life, such as environmental outcomes or technological progress?
- How can researchers distinguish whether changes in trends are due to policies, control systems or other factors?
- Is there research that compares the effectiveness of policies in different scenarios, considering the presence of control systems and other factors?

# Gwern’s AI-Generated Poetry
*March 14, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/03/14/gwerns-ai-generated-poetry/

## Summary
Key ideas
- GPT-2 is a language processing system that generates text.
- Gwern used the Gutenberg Poetry Corpus to retrain GPT-2 to create a specialized poetry AI.
- The AI generates poetry that shows competence in iambic pentameter and basic metaphorical language, but has problems with rhyme and maintaining rhyme schemes.

Key learnings
- The poetry generated by GPT-2 trained on the Gutenberg Poetry Corpus exhibits some competence in technical aspects of poetry.
- The AI-generated poetry often starts strong in metrics and rhyme, but deteriorates quickly.
- The limitations of GPT-2 may be less fundamental than was previously thought, and may be accounted for by better training data.

Key questions
- Why is GPT-2 able to generate some technical aspects of poetry well, but not others?
- How can training data for GPT-2 be improved to generate better poetry?
- What are the implications of technology like GPT-2 for the future of creativity and literature?

# Book Review: Inventing The Future
*March 18, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/03/18/book-review-inventing-the-future/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The book "Inventing the Future" criticizes the failure of "folk politics"
- It proposes a "counter-hegemonic project" inspired by the Mont Pelerin Society
- The plan is for leftists to fight for a post-work world by supporting automation and a universal basic income
- Universal Basic Income (UBI) can overturn the asymmetry of power between labor and capital.
- S&W's platform includes full automation, reduction of the working week, provision of a basic income, and diminishment of the work ethic.
- Scott questions the necessity of the first three items of S&W's platform.
- S&W often use the word "hegemony" to refer to a self-consistent way of looking at the world that guides how we think about things and what questions we ask.
- Criticism of Inventing The Future's focus on propaganda to convert the masses to communism
- Discussion of the Mont Pelerin Society's success in taking over academia and its emphasis on cultivating intellectual talent
- Importance of utopianism for the left, and criticism of capitalism and neoliberalism's stifling of utopian ideals

Key learnings:
- Leftist groups should embody utopian leftist values right now, according to S&W's principle of prefiguration
- S&W propose a Mont Pelerinish approach to take over institutions in the name of leftism, creating a network of academics, journalists, think tanks, and politicians who come up with leftist ideas
- The demand for automation and a universal basic income is a demand for a political transformation, not just an economic one
- UBI can lead to costlier labor, driving wages up, and encouraging non-automated businesses to automate, which reduces the need for workers and the work ethic.
- S&W's platform is heavily dependent on UBI, and the demand for UBI must include the provision of a sufficient amount to live on, universality, and supplementarity to the welfare state.
- Universalism has a critical history and raising universal demands as part of communism can raise issues of inclusion and exclusion.
- Success in taking over academia and other consensus-building organs requires cultivating intellectual talent and having a good idea that reasoned debate supports
- Utopianism is a potent weapon for promoting ideas and movements, and the left should reclaim it from neoliberalism

Key questions:
- How can leftists balance the demand for prefigurative experience and the need for concrete results?
- Is the plan to take over institutions in the name of leftism really new or just an updated version of the "long march through the institutions"?
- What are the chances of achieving a post-work world through automation and a universal basic income, and how can leftists create broad popular support for this demand?
- How can we justify full automation, the reduction of the working week, and the diminishment of the work ethic?
- What is the difference between "hegemony" and "power," and how does understanding the former help us analyze communist paradigms?
- How can we reconcile the need for universal communist ideals with their problematic heritage and possible exclusions?
- How important is the role of propaganda in promoting political ideas, and is it effective in converting people to a particular ideology?
- How can the left effectively compete with other groups seeking to take over academia and other influential institutions?
- Can utopianism be reconciled with practical considerations, such as limited resources and existing power structures?

# Translating Predictive Coding Into Perceptual Control
*March 20, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/03/20/translating-predictive-coding-into-perceptual-control/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The free energy principle says that all life is driven by the imperative to reduce the gulf between expectations and sensory inputs.
- Perceptual control theory and free energy/predictive coding are fundamentally the same paradigm.
- The author provides a glossary to help understand the concepts of prediction, expectation, set point, reference level, prediction error, surprise, active inference, and behavior as control of perception.
- Perceptual control theory uses more intuitive terms than free energy/predictive coding, which can be confusing.

Key learnings:
- Free energy/predictive coding grew out of an account of world-modeling, while perceptual control theory explains movement, motivation, and desire.
- FE/PC terminology should be kept, but PCT terminology can be taught as a learning aid.

Key questions:
- How come everyone uses the FE/PC formulation instead of the PCT formulation since PCT has more advantages?
- Is Powers' explanation of world-modeling the same as FE/PC?
- Could it be possible to construct a PCT look at world-modeling?

# Neurons And Intelligence: A Birdbrained Perspective
*March 25, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/03/25/neurons-and-intelligence-a-birdbrained-perspective/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Brain size relative to body is not the only factor in determining intelligence
- The encephalization quotient (EQ) is a useful indicator but not perfect in predicting intelligence
- Birds have high intelligence despite having small brains and a different brain structure than mammals
- Number of cortical neurons may be one of the most important biological substrates of intelligence
- Quick and efficient neural communication is also important
- Pilot whales may be smarter than humans based on their cortical neuron count

Key learnings:
- Number of neurons in the brain may be a better predictor of intelligence than brain size relative to body
- The neocortical structure may not be necessary for high intelligence, as is demonstrated in birds

Key questions:
- What is the physiological basis for intelligence?
- Can we develop a generalized animal IQ test?
- Are there other variations within species that impact intelligence other than number of neurons and neural communication?

# [PARTIALLY RETRACTED] Cortical Neuron Number Matches Intuitive Perceptions Of Moral Value Across Animals
*March 26, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/03/26/cortical-neuron-number-matches-intuitive-perceptions-of-moral-value-across-animals/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Animals' intelligence is correlated with their number of cortical neurons.
- A scale can be created to place animals and humans on the same ladder using this correlation.
- Different animal rights people have different ideas for calculating the moral value of animals.

Key learnings
- People's intuitive ideas about the moral value of animals corresponded with their cortical neuron count.
- The survey results on how many animals it takes to have the same moral worth as a human are pretty similar to the neuron count of animals needed to equal one human.

Key questions
- How can a more representative population be surveyed to validate the results?
- Do different species of animal have similar moral values?
- Are there more accurate ways of calculating animal intelligence to determine their moral worth?

# Partial Retraction Of Post On Animal Value And Neural Number
*March 28, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/03/28/partial-retraction-of-post-on-animal-value-and-neural-number/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The author conducted a survey on how people thought about the moral weights of animals.
- Commenter Tibbar replicated the survey using Mechanical Turk and found different results.
- The author acknowledges limitations to Tibbar's findings, including the sample demographics and potential lack of moral theory.

Key learnings
- Using Mechanical Turk may not be a reliable way to replicate a survey, as the sample may differ significantly from the original survey's population.
- It is important to consider the limitations and potential biases of any survey results.

Key questions
- How can survey methods be improved to better replicate population demographics and minimize potential biases?
- How do different moral theories affect individual beliefs about animal rights?

# Two Wolves And A Sheep
*March 28, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/03/28/two-wolves-and-a-sheep/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The quote “Democracy is two wolves and a sheep deciding what to have for dinner” is used to describe problems with democracy. 
- These problems include pandering to the tiebreaking vote, the dominance of special interests, and unrealistic demands from activists. 
- The scenario ends with talks breaking down over who gets the tastiest cuts of mutton, and the Gray Wolf Party eating the second wolf.

Key learnings
- Democracy can have issues with pandering to special interests and unrealistic demands from activists. 
- The tiebreaking vote can be a source of tension in elections. 
- Talks between opposing parties can break down over seemingly trivial issues.

Key questions
- What specific issues are caused by the tiebreaking vote in elections? 
- How can special interests be prevented from dominating in a democratic system? 
- Can the problems with democracy described in this post be solved or mitigated in any way?

# Social Censorship: The First Offender Model
*April 2, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/04/02/social-censorship-the-first-offender-model/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- A study found that about 40% of Americans support some form of eugenics, despite the belief that moral opposition to eugenics was universal.
- The lack of support for eugenics was primarily due to concerns about effectiveness rather than moral opposition.
- The author uses a metaphor of norm enforcement through coordinated retaliation to explain why there is an opposition norm to eugenics.
- The author notes that opposition norms can shift through well-coordinated opposition waging a battle leading to new coordination norms.

Key learnings:
- There is not as much universal opposition to eugenics as previously thought.
- Opposition norms to certain beliefs can be formed through coordinated retaliation leading to new coordination norms.
- The same coordination shift happened in the battle for gay rights.

Key questions:
- How can a structural opposition to censorship be created when opponents can coordinate to suppress ideas?
- Can the same coordination shift happen with other contested ideas?

# Short Book Reviews April 2019
*April 9, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/04/09/short-book-reviews-april-2019/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The Method of Levels, based on perceptual control theory, is presented as the perfect solution to all psychological problems.
- MoL sees intrapsychic conflict as competing control systems and suggests activating the natural reorganizing process of the brain through awareness to solve these conflicts.
- MoL is somewhat similar to psychodynamic therapy, but with more concrete suggestions.
- How to Read Lacan by Slavoj Zizek is a readable, but not very coherent interpretation of Lacanianism.
- The Steerswoman is a popular, but relatively apolitical, 80s fantasy series featuring a rationalist organization of steerswomen seeking knowledge.

Key learnings:
- MoL might have some useful insights for treating psychological conflict, but its claims of being a one-size-fits-all solution are problematic.
- Awareness and discussion of conflicts with a therapist can lead to reorganization of higher-level control systems in MoL, which can solve intrapsychic conflict.
- Zizek's book might not be the best starting point for understanding Lacanianism.
- The Steerswoman is a fun, bare-boned fantasy series that is relatively apolitical.

Key questions:
- Can MoL really solve every psychological problem?
- How well does MoL's theoretical backing hold up?
- What exactly is Lacanianism, and is Zizek's book a good introduction to it?
- How effective would a real-life organization of steerswomen be in answering any question asked of them?

# Pain As Active Ingredient In Dating
*April 10, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/04/10/pain-as-active-ingredient-in-dating/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Reciprocity is a dating site where users can checkmark the names of their Facebook friends whom they want to date. 
- Reciprocity reveals a match when two users checkmark each other's names. 
- Users sometimes don't receive the notification of a match even when there is a mutual checkmark, causing confusion and self-doubt. 
- The act of asking someone out in person is a stronger signal of interest than just checking a box on a dating site. 

Key learnings
- The self-defeating behavior on Reciprocity shows that pain and awkwardness can sometimes be the active ingredients in social systems. 
- Trying to improve social systems without fully understanding them can have unintended consequences. 

Key questions
- Why do some users prefer the pain and awkwardness of asking someone out in person instead of just checking a box on the site? 
- How can dating sites like Reciprocity improve their system to avoid confusion and self-doubt among users? 
- What are other examples of social systems where bureaucracy, pain, or awkwardness are the active ingredients?

# Increasingly Competitive College Admissions: Much More Than You Wanted To Know
*April 15, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/04/15/increasingly-competitive-college-admissions-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Acceptance rates at top colleges have declined by about half over the past decade.
- Pressure of getting into a good university may be leading to suicides at elite high schools.
- There are more than enough non-selective colleges for everyone, but competition for competitive schools is increasing.
- Early American colleges had simpler admission requirements and the students were mostly prepared for the coursework.
- Harvard only accepted students who were fluent in Latin and Greek, which was shockingly common at the time.
- In the late 19th century, there was a movement to standardize college admissions which led to the transition from making sure students were ready to rationing out scarce spots.
- By the 1920s, top colleges switched from standardized testing to an easier-to-bias "holistics admissions" system that implemented quotas in the 1960s to limit the number of Jewish students.
- Before the 20th century, becoming a doctor, lawyer, or college graduate was much more accessible and less regulated.
- Despite the lack of gatekeeping measures or strict admission requirements, there was no oversupply of doctors or lawyers and salaries remained high.
- The ease of entering these professions may have been due to the fact that the majority of Americans were farmers and didn't have many other career options.
- In the mid-1900s, a combination of factors led to an increase in college attendance, including the GI Bill and the college loophole for avoiding the draft.
- The rise of the college degree as a signal for intelligence, and the increased sorting of people by college selectivity, made knowledge worker jobs increasingly necessary to earn a living.
- The number of US students applying to college has decreased over the past ten years, but admissions to top colleges have become much more competitive.
- There is a perception of increased competition for college admissions.
- Possible reasons for this include the increased number of applications per person, increased common knowledge of competition leading to more intense competition, and decreased reliance on hard-to-game metrics like the SAT.
- Beyond college level, competition is intensifying in fields like medicine and law.
- Admissions to top colleges, medical schools, and law schools have become more competitive over the years.
- Until 1900, there was no competition for these places.
- Increased competition in the past ten years might be due to the ease of applying to more colleges or because of students getting stuck in a high-competition equilibrium.
- Going to a selective college as an undergraduate does not necessarily lead to a more lucrative career or a higher chance of admission to postgraduate education unless a person is from a disadvantaged background.
- There is no good data about graduate schools, but prestigious graduate schools are almost an absolute requirement for becoming a professor in many fields.

Key learnings:
- The pressure of getting into a good university has risen, leading to increased competition for the same number of spots at competitive schools.
- The rise of standardized testing and holistics admissions led to the implementation of quotas in the 1960s that limited the number of Jewish students at top colleges.
- The lack of gatekeeping measures for professions like doctor or lawyer did not lead to an oversupply of professionals or a decline in salaries.
- The college enrollment boom in the mid-1900s was driven by a complex interaction of factors, including the GI Bill and the college loophole for avoiding the draft.
- The rise of the college degree as a signal for intelligence complements other changes in hiring practices, such as declining reliance on hunch-based methods.
- Despite a recent decrease in the number of US students applying to college, admissions to top colleges have become much more competitive.
- The online Common Application has doubled the number of applications sent to top colleges.
- The reasons behind increasing competition in college admissions may be a combination of factors, including increased efforts by students and colleges to stand out, and increased sorting.
- In fields like medicine, the number of applicants is increasing faster than the number of spots available.
- Until the 1900s, getting into top colleges, medical schools, and law schools was not a problem because there was no competition.
- Unless a person is disadvantaged, going to a more selective college does not necessarily lead to a more lucrative career or a higher chance of admission to postgraduate education.

Key questions:
- Have college admissions always been a big deal and how did college admissions become competitive?
- Is academia more competitive now than in the past, and what's responsible for this?
- Is freaking out about college admissions the correct course of action?
- Why was there no oversupply of doctors or lawyers before gatekeeping measures were put in place?
- What factors contributed to the decline in reliance on hunch-based hiring practices?
- What role did the government's provision of supposedly-free college loans play in the rise of college attendance?
- Why have college admissions to top schools become more competitive despite a decrease in the number of US students applying to college?
- Could the increasing number of international students affect selectivity?
- How much does the emphasis on extracurriculars affect college admissions?
- Are funding cuts affecting the number of positions available at public universities?
- How did the secular trend towards increasing admissions for top colleges, medical schools, and law schools start?
- Why are UC schools more difficult to get into than other schools in California?
- How do colleges help induct people into the upper class besides providing book-learning?

# Highlights From The Comments On College Admissions
*April 17, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/04/17/highlights-from-the-comments-on-college-admissions/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Donors and board members use national rankings, which include low admission rates, as a measure of how well a school is doing.
- Consulting firms often only consider applicants from certain elite schools.
- The rise of the Common App might incentivize schools to get as many applicants as possible.
- College selectivity is significant even after controlling for student quality as measured by SAT scores.
- The issue of college admissions affects a small subset of institutions.
- The college admissions process has become increasingly competitive over time, with more students applying to top schools and investing more effort into preparing for admissions criteria.
- The rise of college rankings has contributed to the pressure to succeed in college admissions.
- The lack of transparency in the financial aid process creates incentives for students to apply to more schools to increase their chances of receiving a good offer.
- The increase in Advanced Placement exams shows that competition for college admissions is getting tougher.

Key learnings:
- The competitiveness of the college admissions process is driven by various factors, including rankings and prestigious job opportunities.
- Financial considerations, such as the cost of attendance and financial aid packages, can significantly impact the college selection process.
- The number of students competing for admissions has increased over time, and the expectations for applicants have risen accordingly.
- College rankings and financial aid policies have contributed to the intensifying competition.
- The rise of the internet and other technology has made it easier for students to prepare for the admissions process but has also raised the bar for success.

Key questions:
- How can the college admissions process be improved to reduce stress and improve outcomes for students?
- How can we address the impact of financial considerations on college selection and admissions?
- Are there alternative ways to measure the success of colleges and universities that do not incentivize low admission rates?
- How can we create a fairer and more transparent admissions process that doesn't rely so heavily on rankings?
- Is there a way to make the financial aid process more predictable and fair to help students make informed decisions about where to apply?
- What impact does the intensifying competition have on students who don't make it into the most prestigious colleges and universities?

# 1960: The Year The Singularity Was Cancelled
*April 22, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/04/22/1960-the-year-the-singularity-was-cancelled/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Heinz von Foerster's model from the 1950s used equations to predict the world's end due to population growth in 2026, based on hyperbolic population growth and economic growth
- The trend of hyperbolic growth in the economy and technological advancements, which could have led to a singularity or infinite progress, stopped around 1960 due to the end of hyperbolic population growth
- The Industrial Revolution did not change the historical trend of GDP growth, but shifted the world from a Malthusian regime where economic growth increased the population to modern times where economic growth increased per capita income
- Per capita income in Northern Europe diverged from the rest of the world's from 1348 to 1650 due to the number of plagues they had.
- In 1650, England started breaking out of the Malthusian trap by experiencing technological advances that were faster than the population growth.
- The Industrial Revolution did not represent a deviation from trend for GDP per capita but not for GDP.
- Economic growth outpaced population growth during the Industrial Revolution, causing a shift from a Malthusian regime to a modern one where productivity growth increases GDP per capita.

Key learnings:
- Economic growth is a function of population and productivity, and productivity depends on technological advancements which, in turn, depend on population growth.
- Population growth follows a rate equal to productivity growth in a closed system that is already at its carrying capacity with zero marginal return to extra labor.
- Malthusian trap, where productivity produces people and not prosperity, is a self-fulfilling cycle where people reproduce to fill the resources available to them, keeping everyone at subsistence level.
- The singularity got cancelled as the industrial growth mode had a major disadvantage over the Malthusian mode: tractors can't invent things.
- AI potentially offers a way to convert money into researchers and can bring hyperbolic growth back on.

Key questions:
- What other factors, besides population growth and technological advancement, affect productivity growth?
- Can we predict future technological advancements and their impact on productivity growth?
- Can economies bypass the Malthusian trap?
- How did technological advance finally start moving faster than maximal population growth in 1650 in England?
- How did the singularity get cancelled?
- Can AI bring hyperbolic growth back on?

# Buspirone Shortage In Healthcaristan SSR
*April 30, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/04/30/buspirone-shortage-in-healthcaristan-ssr/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- There is a national shortage of buspirone, a medication used to control anxiety, due to the FDA shutting down a major factory.
- The generic drug manufacturing industry is consolidated, and some manufacturers are exiting the market due to low profits, creating a vulnerability to shortages.
- The Generic Drug User Fee Amendments (GDUFA) of 2012 and 2017 inadvertently encouraged monopolies in the generic drug market, leading to higher prices and fewer competitors.
- Insulin is off-patent but is still sold as brand-name. The FDA approval process for generic insulin is difficult due to its nature as a biologic, and brand-name companies have excessive and illegal patents that make the process even harder.
- FDA regulations have increased the cost of prescription drugs.
- Generics are driving down drug prices, but there is a debate over the effectiveness of this trend.
- The FDA's current structure is limited in its ability to create affordable and consistent access to drugs.

Key learnings:
- The FDA's regulatory choices have contributed to the shortage of buspirone and the high prices of insulin.
- The generic drug manufacturing industry is vulnerable to monopolies and shortages due to consolidation and low profits.
- Insulin's nature as a biologic and excessive patents by brand-name companies make it difficult for generic insulin to enter the market.
- Current trends are positive and are driving down drug prices.
- Improving the system to make drugs affordable requires dramatic changes that the FDA may not be in control of.

Key questions:
- Why is the pharmaceutical industry more vulnerable to shortages than other industries?
- How can the FDA balance the need for regulation with the need for affordable medication?
- What can be done to encourage more competitors in the generic drug market and prevent monopolies?
- Can the FDA make the necessary changes to allow for affordable drugs?
- What are the limitations of the current FDA system in terms of making drugs affordable and accessible?
- What changes need to happen to make drugs consistently available to patients?

# 5-HTTLPR: A Pointed Review
*May 7, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/05/07/5-httlpr-a-pointed-review/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- In 1996, research discovered that individuals with an unusual version of the serotonin transporter gene 5-HTTLPR are often depressed.
- 5-HTTLPR appears to affect the amygdala and reactivity of the HPA axis, leading researchers to believe it may have relevance for antidepressant treatment.
- Over 450 studies have been conducted on 5-HTTLPR and its contribution to depression and other psychiatric conditions (e.g. PTSD, insomnia, nostalgia-proneness), but many studies did not have sample sizes large enough to detect an effect.
- A more recent study with over 600,000+ participants found that 5-HTTLPR and seventeen other comparable “depression genes” had no effect on depression, casting doubt upon previous studies.
- GeneSight is a company that claims to predict which anti-depressant will work best for a given patient by checking their genes.
- The genes used in GeneSight's test have been proven to have no or little effect on depression.
- The author is worried that no one is noticing the failure of GeneSight's method, and that there may be other scientific hypotheses that are similarly unproven.

Key learnings:
- Little research has been conducted on the relationship between genes and psychiatric conditions using standardized techniques necessary to detect an effect.
- Even small effects require samples sizes of at least 34,000 people, yet most studies on 5-HTTLPR did not have sample sizes large enough to detect an effect.
- The accumulation of studies investigating the relationship between a single gene and a complex trait like depression should have lead to greater knowledge but ended up providing less.
- GeneSight's method for predicting antidepressant response based on genetics is flawed.
- Claims made by companies like GeneSight should be treated skeptically.
- Independent research is needed to validate claims made by private companies.

Key questions:
- How have psychiatrists justified the use of 5-HTTLPR and other depression genes in the face of inconclusive or negative results?
- Why have antidepressant pharmacogenomic tests, which rely on genes like 5-HTTLPR, become so popular despite evidence that they do not work?
- What are the implications for the field of psychiatry given the accumulation of fake results based on single gene studies?
- How many other scientific hypotheses and products are similarly unproven?
- Why are there no updates on GeneSight's failed method?
- How can we ensure that claims made by private companies are independently researched and validated?

# Is There A Case For Skepticism Of Psychedelic Therapy?
*May 9, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/05/09/is-there-a-case-for-skepticism-of-psychedelic-therapy/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Recent discussion on the use of psychedelics in psychiatry has been overwhelmingly positive and this post reviews a case for skepticism.
- Psychedelics have been investigated mostly in small studies by true believers which often produces unreplicable results.
- Some of the most impressive stories on psychedelic use involve psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy which is not exclusive to psychedelics and psychotherapy itself has many success stories floating around.
- Ketamine and NSI-189 are good comparisons to psychedelics as revolutionary new treatments that have failed to live up to their hype.
- Between 10% and 50% of Americans have tried psychedelics and if psychedelics did something groundbreaking, it would be known by now.
- Psychedelics stimulate the insight system artificially and may produce short-lasting effects that make people feel like their problems are solved.
- Even if psychedelics work well, the FDA could make it difficult for people to access them.

Key learnings:
- It is important to be skeptical of the hype around the use of psychedelics in psychiatry.
- The use of anecdotal evidence to support the efficacy of psychedelic use in psychiatry might not be reliable.
- The FDA has a significant role to play in the adoption of these treatments.

Key questions:
- Are psychedelics actually revolutionary or have they been overhyped?
- How long-lasting are the effects of psychedelics and how do they compare to other treatments?
- What role should the FDA play in regulating the use of these treatments?

# Age Gaps And Birth Order Effects
*May 14, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/05/14/age-gaps-and-birth-order-effects/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Psychologists are split on the existence of “birth order effects”.
- Last year's survey revealed that SSC readers had a 70-30 imbalance in favor of older siblings.
- Birth order effects may not affect IQ but could affect something like “intellectual curiosity”.
- There are several possible explanations for why firstborns may be more intellectually curious than later-born siblings.
- Age gaps affect the strength of birth order effects; people separated from their older siblings by more than seven years will act like firstborn children.
- The results suggest that intra-family competition or parental investment may be the major cause of birth order effects.

Key learnings:
- Birth order effects exist but are weak and inconsistent.
- The strength of birth order effects decreases after an age gap of seven years.
- Intra-family competition or parental investment may be the major cause of birth order effects.

Key questions:
- Why are firstborns more intellectually curious?
- How can we make laterborns more intellectually curious?
- How does age gap affect birth order effects?
- Is having a sibling in early childhood the cause of birth order effects, but one in middle childhood is not?
- How do we distinguish between intra-family competition and parental investment hypotheses?

# A Critical Period For Lactation Fetishes
*May 15, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/05/15/a-critical-period-for-lactation-fetishes/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Enquist et al studied lactation fetishes to understand how people develop fetishes
- They theorized that sexual imprinting during critical childhood years can lead to fetishes
- They found that people with younger siblings have more lactation fetishes, supporting their critical window theory
- Scott questions whether birth order effects on openness to experience can explain Enquist et al's findings

Key learnings:
- Enquist et al's critical window theory on fetishes may be explained by birth order effects on openness to experience
- Having a younger sibling does not necessarily increase the likelihood of developing baby-related fetishes

Key questions:
- How do people develop fetishes and what are the factors that contribute to their formation?
- How do critical childhood years affect sexual imprinting and fetish development?
- Can birth order effects on openness to experience explain some of the variations in fetish prevalence among individuals?
- If Enquist et al's findings are due to birth order effects, what implications does it have for our understanding of fetish development?

# [REPOST] Epistemic Learned Helplessness
*June 3, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/03/repost-epistemic-learned-helplessness/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- People lack the basic skill of believing arguments.
- The art of rationality should not aim to make people believe something after it has been proven to them.
- The more educated people are, the less they trust certain ideas.
- Epistemic learned helplessness is a form of protective skepticism that is useful in most cases.

Key learnings:
- It is important to develop critical thinking skills to be able to evaluate arguments.
- Becoming too convinced of an argument without considering opposing views can be dangerous.
- Taking ideas seriously should be the last skill one learns, after learning other skills that allow them to determine which ideas are correct or not.

Key questions:
- How effective are institutes and collaborations in filtering through studies and analyses?
- What are the limitations of epistemic learned helplessness?
- How can we strike a balance between skepticism and taking ideas seriously?

# Book Review: The Secret Of Our Success
*June 4, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/04/book-review-the-secret-of-our-success/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Humans succeeded not just because of raw intelligence, but due to cultural evolution and the transmission of culture with high fidelity.
- Culture is essential in teaching humans how to survive and adapt in challenging environments like hunting and gathering.
- Humans' digestive tracts, hands and limbs, and sweat glands evolved alongside their cultures and food processing techniques.
- Human brains are optimized for transmitting culture to the next generation, and they have biases in cultural learning.
- Humans have a hard-coded slot that culture and traditions go into.
- Infants are programmed to want to learn language, flora, fauna and social hierarchy.
- Infants gradually learn what is locally edible through cultural cues.
- Hunter-gatherers preferentially learn from people who are good at skills and who are like them.
- Post-childhood learning is crucial for tribes with complex technologies and skills.
- Old people are valuable because they retain knowledge of local culture.
- Traditional decision-making biases can be compensated by cultural evolution through practices like divination.
- Evolutionary psychology explains why humans rely on tradition and have a fear of questioning it.
- The unpredictability of random strategies can be useful in situations like hunting and war.
- Causally opaque cultural adaptations can lead to counterintuitive practices that are difficult to understand or replicate individually.
- Discussion of the meta-tradition of defending against reason
- Importance of traditions and potential consequences of discarding them
- The idea that maybe we are not yet at the point where unique contributions are sought after
- Need to continuously read about similar themes to fully understand the importance of preserving traditions

Key learnings:
- Human culture is crucial to survival and adaptation.
- Cultural evolution is a primary factor that separates humans from other species.
- Human brains are optimized for transmitting culture to the next generation.
- Infants are programmed to learn specific things from their environment by filling them into the appropriate slots.
- Cultural learning begins in infancy and continues throughout life.
- Learning from respected others plays a critical role for both children and adults.
- Traditional practices like divination can serve as effective randomizing devices that help decision-making.
- It is difficult for individuals to figure out the functions, interrelationships, or importance of causally opaque cultural adaptations.
- Reasoning can be a dangerous force that leads people away from adaptive behavior.
- Successful cultures stigmatize certain behaviors and practices to discourage individuals from even trying them.
- Some traditions may seem irrational or outdated, but they may have important purposes that we may not understand.
- Preservation of traditions is crucial, and discarding them could have negative consequences for society.
- It is important to continuously learn and read on similar themes to fully comprehend the value of traditions.

Key questions:

# List Of Passages I Highlighted In My Copy Of “The Secret Of Our Success”
*June 5, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/05/list-of-passages-i-highlighted-in-my-copy-of-the-secret-of-our-success/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The success of groups in the Highland region of New Guinea is related to their ability to raise and exchange pigs.
- Cultural transmission between groups can occur rapidly through the adoption of successful practices, beliefs, and institutions.
- Children have certain "slots" in their heads for specific types of learning, including a fascination with fire during middle childhood.
- Quadruped animals have discrete optimal speed settings for different styles of locomotion due to thermoregulation constraints.
- Spices may represent a cultural adaptation to the problem of food-borne pathogens, with the use of certain spices being more common in hotter climates.
- Culture has shaped genes for skin color over the past 10 millennia as an adaptation to exposure to ultraviolet light.
- The amount of melanin in our skin is determined by the latitude where our ancestors lived and the need to protect against UVA and UVB rays.
- Darker-skinned people can face vitamin D deficiencies at high latitudes, leading to health problems.
- Gene-culture coevolution shows that variation is much more widespread than 19th-century racial categories.
- Social status increases inclusive fitness, leading to greater mating success and reproductive output.
- The Great Sanhedrin's deliberate ordering of speakers allows for the sharing of unbiased opinions.
- Ju/'hoansi society's naming practices help create kinship networks that are otherwise gender-egalitarian.
- South American indigenous populations have social norms that promote investment in children over concerns of sexual fidelity.
- Humans have an innate susceptibility to picking up meat aversions.
- Negativity bias causes rare cases of taboo violation followed by bad luck or illness to be remembered and passed on.
- Norms are maintained through reputation; violating norms causes the reputational shield to drop and opens one up to being exploited by others.
- Larger, more interconnected populations tend to have more sophisticated tools, techniques, weapons, and know-how.
- Cultural evolution creates cognitive tools or mental abilities that humans would not otherwise have.
- The sonority of spoken languages tends to be higher in warmer climates, where people work, play, cook, and relax outdoors.
- The variation in the sonority of languages can be partially accounted for by climatic temperature
- Languages in warmer climates use more vowels and rely more on sonorant consonants, while those in colder climates lean more heavily on the least sonorous vowels
- Dense forest cover and cold, windy climates may influence linguistic practices
- Social norms about sexual restrictiveness might also influence sonority
- Cultural learning can change physiological reactions to pain
- Humans should design "variation and selection systems" for organizations and institutions to compete, similar to capitalism

Key learnings:
- Cultural transmission between groups can occur rapidly through the adoption of successful practices, beliefs, and institutions, and political decision-making institutions can facilitate this process.
- Children have specific periods of fascination with certain types of learning.
- The use of specific spices in cooking may represent a cultural adaptation to the problem of food-borne pathogens.
- Skin color represents a genetic adaptation to exposure to ultraviolet light, and different shades of skin color are found in different parts of the world as a result.
- Melanin levels in our skin are determined by our ancestors' need for protection against UVA and UVB rays.
- Social status has positive effects on reproductive output and mating success.
- The Great Sanhedrin's method for ordering speakers allows for unbiased opinions.
- Naming practices can create kinship networks that are otherwise gender-egalitarian.
- Humans have an innate tendency to acquire meat aversions.
- Negativity bias contributes to the sustainability of cultural norms.
- Reputation is important in smaller communities for maintaining social norms.
- Larger populations are more likely to develop more sophisticated societal tools and techniques.
- Cultural evolution creates cognitive tools and abilities that shape our minds and are passed down through generations.
- The sonority of spoken language can be influenced by environmental factors, such as temperature.
- The experience and environment of a culture can shape its language
- Cultural learning can affect physiological reactions to pain
- Alternative institutions and organizational forms should be allowed to compete to gain general insights

Key questions:
- How can successful practices, beliefs, and institutions be distinguished from less successful ones in cultural transmission?
- What other types of learning are children primed for during specific developmental periods?
- What are the implications of the cultural reinterpretation of pain signals as pleasure or excitement?
- Are there other cultural adaptations to environmental challenges that have had significant effects on the genetic makeup of populations?
- Can the Sanhedrin's method for ordering speakers backfire in certain situations?
- How can we determine the non-arbitrary justification for choosing a particular scale to assess the history of a particular practice?
- How can we apply the study of gene-culture coevolution to address 19th-century racial categories and its impact on contemporary society?
- Did evolution favor confirmation bias to reinforce cultural rules?
- What are the implications of intergroup competition favoring the spread of tricks for expanding what members of a group perceive as their tribe?
- How can we fight racism if ethnicity, rather than race, is a more natural category in humans?
- How do spoken languages adapt culturally and what other environmental variables affect this adaptation?
- How much nuance can be added to the climatic temperature analysis of the variation in the sonority of language?
- What other factors can influence linguistic practices besides climate and social norms about sexual restrictiveness?
- How can humans improve their ability to design effective institutions and organizations?

# Asymmetric Weapons Gone Bad
*June 6, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/06/asymmetric-weapons-gone-bad/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Asymmetric weapons are tools that are effective only for the "good guys".
- Rational debate may not always lead to the best outcome.
- Epistemic traps refer to problems where the more you study a topic, the more confused you get.
- Some actions and concerns are "illegible" and hard to explain.
- Communication methods can influence the outcome of debates.
- Two schools of thought on why turn-of-the-century Britain never went communist

# Addendum To “Enormous Nutshell”: Competing Selectors
*June 7, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/07/addendum-to-enormous-nutshell-competing-selectors/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Right-wing policies and systems are those selected by cultural evolution, while left-wing policies and systems are selected by the marketplace of ideas.
- Under this definition, fascism, communism, and liberalism are all left-wing ideas.
- Dictatorships may be more effective than democracies at implementing right-wing policies due to their ability to resist pressure from activists and the masses.
- Creating a system conducive to cultural evolution, with a patchwork of small countries ruled by absolute dictators, could be a way to guarantee that a collection of countries works well.

Key learnings:
- Humans are bad at designing effective institutions and organizations, so it's better to create "variation and selection systems" that allow alternative institutions or organizational forms to compete.
- Memetic evolution gets faster and faster, resulting in the spread of convincing-sounding but false ideas.
- Cultural evolution may be a counterweight to memetic evolution, and understanding its role can help increase its influence in case of emergency.

Key questions: 
- What prevents every democracy from instantly becoming maximally left-wing?
- Would dictatorships really be higher variance than democracies?
- Would cultural evolution at the international level work quickly enough to be humane?
- How can we raise the sanity waterline and make true things more convincing than false things?

# Book Review: Why Are The Prices So D*mn High?
*June 10, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/10/book-review-the-prices-are-too-dmn-high/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Rising costs of services such as healthcare and education have been a mystery for years.
- Economists Eric Helland and Alex Tabarrok explain that the stagnation of labor productivity is the root cause of the increasing costs of these services.
- Most sectors of the economy experienced substantial growth in labor productivity, making slow productivity-growth sectors relatively more expensive.
- The phenomenon of the Baumol effect is a natural consequence of high economic growth.
- Education and healthcare remain popular despite their increasing costs, creating a strong pressure to increase wages.
- T&H use a study to show that the lower productivity growth in an industry, the higher the rise in costs, especially if they use college-educated workers who could otherwise get higher-productivity industries.

Key learnings
- The Baumol effect is a crucial part of the explanation for the rise in service prices.
- Service costs have been rising consistently over a broad range of industries.
- Alternative explanations related to administrative bloat, overregulation, medical malpractice lawsuits, or teacher unions don't seem to work.
- Service quality has improved only a little and accounts only for a small fraction of the increase in costs.

Key questions
- Why are rising wages for factory workers not pushing up salaries for violinists, teachers, and doctors if low productivity is the root cause of rising costs?
- How can a 6% increase in teacher salaries drive an increase of 100%+ in costs, as shown by data sources?
- How can healthcare become less affordable if the Baumol effect has no impact on affordability?

# Highlights From The Comments On Cultural Evolution
*June 11, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/11/highlights-from-the-comments-on-cultural-evolution/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Creating conlangs isn't necessarily hard, but it's hard to do top-down modeling of processes that are the result of many modifications over time.
- Human culture allowed us to lose some adaptations we no longer needed, like strength.
- In the modern world, adhering rigidly to traditions is a recipe for disaster since the context is constantly changing.
- We need both inventiveness and the ability to transmit inventions to future generations to thrive.
- Proper rationality requires being coldly rational about evaluating the high-but-not-perfect reliability of tradition as a source of fact.
- Rituals requiring more effort produce more random results than those requiring less effort
- Cheap computers lead to less reliable statistical results
- Humans are metabolically disadvantaged for running but can still run down prey by endurance running
- Linguistic complexity might be maintained through schisms
- Illegible preferences should be respected by default
- Transference is a complex topic that can reshape beliefs
- The UAE might not be an exception to the conditions of the labor market
- The strategy used in AlphaStar, an AI, is an example of memetic evolution through the Chestertonian tradition concept.
- AlphaStar's learning algorithms noticed what was working and what wasn't and developed a strategy of mass-producing probes and building mass blink-stalkers.
- All of history can be viewed as evolution evolving better evolutions, with the worst evolution (random chance) creating the first replicator and kicking off biological evolution.

Key learnings:
- The distinctive features of language require frequent practical use and input from individuals with varying interests and focuses.
- Ensuring high-fidelity adherence to traditions and maintaining the inherited ancestral environment/context can ensure survival.
- More effort put into rituals makes them more likely to produce random results
- Cheap computers can lead to less reliable statistical results
- Humans can run down prey by endurance running despite metabolic disadvantage
- Language complexity might be maintained after schisms
- Legible preferences should be respected to improve relationships
- Transference can reshape beliefs
- The UAE labor market might not be an exception
- Learning algorithms can be smart enough to notice successful strategies and replicate them.
- Cultural evolution, such as free market economies, is an evolutionary system that selects for successful technologies.
- AIs, like AlphaStar, represent the next step in this process of evolution evolving better evolutions.

Key questions:
- How much does a "language instinct" put the difficulty of creating language "under the hood"?
- Can we fault societies that were not experimental enough in the 19th century for being more experimental in the 20th century?
- How accurate is the book on cultural adaptation to Cassava and Tukanoan culture?
- Are there other examples of rituals that require more effort producing more random results?
- How can we improve statistical reliability in the age of cheap computers?
- What other adaptations have humans developed to compensate for metabolic disadvantage?
- How can we preserve linguistic complexity across cultures and time?
- How can we better respect illegible preferences in our relationships?
- How can we apply transference to reshape our beliefs for the better?
- Are there other factors that influence working conditions in the UAE labor market?
- Can the memetic evolution through the Chestertonian tradition concept be applied to other areas besides AI strategy?
- What other systems or technologies could benefit from evolutionary selection?
- Are there ethical concerns with allowing AIs to evolve in this manner?

# Followup On The Baumol Effect: Thanks, O Baumol
*June 17, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/17/followup-on-the-baumol-effect-thanks-o-baumol/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Author is criticizing Alex Tabarrok and Eric Helland's book about high prices
- Tabarrok responded to the criticism by saying the data is inconclusive and answers will never be conclusive
- Scott presents evidence to refute the book's claims that the Baumol effect is causing cost disease
- Evidence includes charts and data on wages in education and medicine not rising, and doctor salaries not doubling or tripling
- Scott also argues that the Baumol effect cannot make things genuinely less affordable for society, but things are genuinely less affordable for individuals

Key learnings:
- The data presented in Why Are The Prices So D*mn High? may be misleading and inconclusive
- The evidence presented by Scott contradicts the book's claims about rising wages causing cost disease
- Wages in high-productivity sectors and education/medicine have not risen, which doesn't support the Baumol effect as a cause of cost disease
- The Baumol effect does not make things genuinely less affordable for society, but it is still possible for individuals to be affected by it if they aren't sharing in the increased productivity of society

Key questions:
- How can we explain the rising costs of education and medicine if wages are not the cause?
- Is the Baumol effect still a valid theory for explaining cost disease, or is Scott's evidence enough to refute it?
- How can we address the issue of affordability for individuals affected by the Baumol effect?

# If Kim Jong-Un Opened A KFC, Would You Eat There?
*June 18, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/18/if-kim-jong-un-opened-a-kfc-would-you-eat-there/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Philip Morris and KFC are pivoting to smoke-free and meatless options respectively
- Companies that formerly provided the "smoky meaty past" are now providing smoke-free meatless options
- There is a debate on whether or not to allow these companies to profit from their past bad behavior

Key learnings
- Tobacco-free cigarettes and meat substitutes have helped people quit smoking and become vegetarian, respectively
- It may be beneficial to let evil companies avoid punishment if they are willing to change their behavior
- Boycotting specific companies is difficult due to the existence of parent companies or subsidiary companies in their supply chain

Key questions
- Does allowing formerly evil companies to profit from positive change make a mockery of that change?
- Should companies be punished in order to encourage them to do good, or is the threat of punishment enough?
- What is the right course of action: punish evil companies regardless, let them avoid punishment if they change, or punish them after they have stopped doing evil?

# Are Sexual Purity Taboos A Response To STIs?
*June 19, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/19/are-sexual-purity-taboos-a-response-to-stis/

## Summary
Key ideas
- STIs were a significant problem in the past.
- Sexual purity taboos include marrying a virgin, and marrying a widow is okay, and marrying a former prostitute is beyond the pale.
- Purity taboos derived from paternity issues and STIs.
- There were relatively weak prohibitions on homosexual intercourse, as long as there was a limited role versatility, during the period when STIs were rare and weak.

Key learnings
- There is a plausible relationship between STIs and cultural evolution of taboos against promiscuity and homosexuality.
- The evidence of the relationship between STIs and cultural evolution of taboos against promiscuity and homosexuality is circumstantial.
 
Key questions
- Did cultural evolution create sexual purity taboos to prevent the spread of STIs?
- What about taboos on homosexuality?
- How did taboos change as STIs became more common?
- Were there earlier STIs that might have caused the taboos?

# More Confounders
*June 24, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/24/you-need-more-confounders/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Sleeping pills have been linked to increased mortality rates and higher mortality rates for specific causes of death.
- Studies have attempted to test whether or not the correlation is confounded by factors such as stress, but these studies still largely found a correlation.
- A recent study found that benzodiazepine, a class of sleeping pill, did not increase mortality rates, though it adjusted for more confounders than previous studies.

Key learnings:
- Sleeping pills have been found to be correlated with higher mortality rates for various causes of death, including but not limited to cancer and heart disease.
- Most studies have not been able to attribute the correlation purely to confounding factors.
- A recent study found that benzodiazepines did not increase mortality rates, despite adjusting for an unusually high number of confounders.

Key questions:
- Why does the correlation between sleeping pill usage and higher mortality rates persist even when adjusting for confounding factors?
- Do these findings suggest that other studies linking medication usage to adverse outcomes could be confounded by more factors than previously thought?
- What further research could be done to explore the causes of the correlation between sleeping pill usage and increased mortality rates?

# Style Guide: Not Sounding Like An Evil Robot
*July 4, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/07/04/style-guide-not-sounding-like-an-evil-robot/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Avoid using science or rational terms that might make you sound like an evil robot. 
- Use everyday life terms instead of science terms if you are writing about social signaling, game theory, or anything else where the failure mode is sounding like an evil robot trying to reduce all of life to numbers.
- Use the right term for the right meaning: IQ as a result of an IQ test, intelligence or smart as adjectives; Humans unless you want to contrast with another animal, use people; Males, and females as adjectives and men and women as nouns unless you are trying to make a point that applies to all animals or use it explicitly in Gender studies.
- Rational for adherence to good cognitive strategy and good, best, reasonable when referring to desirable results.
- Optimal to best unless you have specific preference for the longer word. 
- Use utility only when referring to utilitarian philosophy, otherwise use happiness or goodness.
- Autistic for the psychiatric diagnosis or for sensory and cognitive issues, use nerdy when referring to people who are book-smart but lack social graces.
- Use neoreactionary only for the philosophy of Mencius Moldbug, use right-wing, far-right, or reactionary for far-right ideas.

# Gay Rites Are Civil Rites
*July 8, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/07/08/gay-rites-are-civil-rites/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Cultural evolution and shared religion can bind people together and build social trust, making a city into a community.
- American civil religion is a form of symbiosis between society and ideology.
- The American civil religion has lost its sacredness and can no longer answer questions of group identity.
- The San Francisco Gay Pride Parade can be seen as a sublimated Fourth of July Parade, representing a replacement of the American civil religion by social justice.
- Religion adapts to the demands placed on it
- Christianity adopted all the best values (e.g., chastity, family, tradition, patriotism) to be relevant
- The celebration of gay pride is expressing itself in very predictable ways after only fifty years
- Socially useful values change, and religion needs to evolve too
- Social justice will recapitulate the history of other civil religions in fast-forward

Key learnings:
- Religion, on a basic level, answers questions of group identity and why a social system is legitimate.
- The American civil religion has historically been a form of patriotism uniting the country, but it has lost its sacredness and ability to answer the questions of group identity.
- Social justice can be seen as a form of civil religion, with its own answers to the questions of group identity and legitimacy.
- Christianity became Christianity because it adapted, not because of its original doctrine and ideas
- Civil religions adapt and change to stay culturally relevant
- It took only fifty years for the celebration of gay pride to become mainstream, indicating the speed of cultural evolution

Key questions:
- What are the elements of a successful civil religion? How can it answer the questions of group identity and social system legitimacy?
- Why has the American civil religion lost its sacredness? Can it be revitalized?
- In what other ways can social justice be seen as a form of civil religion? What are some potential benefits and drawbacks of this perspective?
- Will social justice look like a mainstream religion in a hundred years, as civil religion adapts?
- How will religion evolve to incorporate changing socially useful values (e.g., chastity or martial valor)?

*July 9, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/07/09/survey-results-sexual-roles/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The author analyzes data on dominance, submission, sadism, and masochism to understand the sexual preferences of men.
- BDSM preferences were found to be gendered, with most cis men preferring the dominant role.
- Factors that made men more likely to be dominant included good social skills, high risk-taking, high ambition, conservative political values, low anxiety, high status, and belief that others are trustworthy.
- Submissive men reported lower sex drive, fewer dates, fewer sexual partners, and fewer long-term relationships than dominant men.

Key learnings
- Most men in the sample preferred the dominant role, with notable gender and orientation differences.
- The sexual roles were not associated with more prosaic forms of selfishness or self-sacrifice.
- Factors that made men more likely to be dominant included personality traits such as low anxiety, high status, and good social skills.

Key questions
- Why are BDSM preferences heavily gendered? 
- Are men who grew up poor more likely to exhibit sexual sadism in adulthood?
- How do personality traits such as good social skills and low anxiety contribute to the likelihood of men being sexually dominant?

# Do People Like Their Mental Health Care?
*July 11, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/07/11/do-people-like-their-mental-health-care/

## Summary
Key ideas
- People who took the SSC survey rated their experience with psychotherapy and medication with a 5.7 on average.
- Only 7% of people had ever been involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital out of those who had seen a psychiatrist or therapist.
- People liked doing therapy from books the most, followed by in-person therapy and online therapy apps the least.
- People with bipolar and ADHD were happier with medication than therapy while alcoholics preferred therapy.
- Autistic people strongly prefer medication perhaps due to hating the social interaction involved in therapy.

Key learnings
- None of the numbers measure whether treatment works, just whether patients were happy.
- All results are vulnerable to selection effects and biases.

Key questions
- What percent of people engaging with the mental health system ended up inpatient based on the survey results?
- Why did autistics prefer medication over therapy?
- Why did people strongly prefer doing therapy from books compared to online therapy apps?

# Against Lie Inflation
*July 16, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/07/16/against-lie-inflation/

## Summary
Key ideas
- The author objects to the broadening of the meaning of words like “abuse” and “lie”.
- Broadening the meaning of these words to include normal human failings decreases their power to separate strong examples from marginal ones.
- The author argues that everyone being an “abuser” or a “liar” removes information that we can use to judge someone’s character and future actions.
- The new connotations of the words that are created in such a scenario can be exploited to ostracize people and silence them based on normal failings.

Key learnings
- It is important not to set the thresholds for category membership outside a distribution, or they will lose their power to convey useful information.
- When words are used to name things that have a small level of the relevant quality, they should apply in more than 0% and less than 100% of cases.

Key questions
- Can broadening the definition of words like “abuse” or “lie” help to fight abuse, bias, or misinformation?
- Are there any other words whose meanings have shifted over time by being gradually applied more loosely?
- How do we decide the right threshold for each individual concept? 
- What are the consequences of rebranding a functioning piece of language until it loses all meaning?

# Caution On Bias Arguments
*July 17, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/07/17/caution-on-bias-arguments/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Correcting for biases is important, but arguments solely based on biases can be unproductive and toxic.
- Everyone is biased all the time and can come up with biases for any issue.
- People are hypersensitive to biases against their side and think biases in favor of their side are irrelevant.
- It's hard to figure out what bias means or when it is bad, especially in cases where both sides of an issue are closely linked to it.
- Bias arguments most people are already aware of have nowhere to go, and low-effort arguments from bias will usually be counterproductive.

Key learnings
- Pointing out a bias can be useful if it gives someone surprising new information, can be quantified, or has an unbiased alternative.
- Biases should be considered most effectively by focusing on first-person bias arguments.
- None of this should apply in private conversations between two people who trust each other.

Key questions
- What are the impacts of hypersensitivity to biases against someone's side, and biases in favor of their side are irrelevant in public discussions, and how to address them?
- How do people know if they're biased or if their opponents are biased? 
- When is it good and when is it bad to adjust opinions based on the most affected party?

# Know Your Gabapentinoids
*July 18, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/07/18/know-your-gabapentinoids/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Gabapentinoids are a class of drugs that resemble GABA but actually act on the A2D subunit of calcium channels.
- Gabapentin is generic and widely used for various ailments, but it has a wide dose range that can cause side effects, and it doesn't work well for some patients.
- Pregabalin is a newer, similar drug that's more expensive because it's not yet available in generic form, but some anxiety patients swear by it.
- It's currently unclear why there might be a difference between pregabalin and gabapentin for anxiety.
- Phenibut is not FDA-approved but is widely used as a supplement/nootropic/recreational drug because of its ability to relieve anxiety and promote a sense of well-being.
- Phenibut's mechanism of action is not well-understood, but some researchers propose that it might work as a gabapentinoid or a GABA-B agonist.
- Baclofen is a stronger GABA-B agonist than phenibut, but it doesn't have the same anti-anxiety effects, and combining it with gabapentin doesn't produce phenibut-like effects.
- It's possible that there's no real difference between phenibut and baclofen/gabapentin, and that the different results are due to how they're used and perceived by humans.

Key learnings
- Gabapentinoids like gabapentin and pregabalin are commonly used for various conditions, but they have a wide dose range and can cause side effects.
- Pregabalin is more expensive than gabapentin and not yet available in generic form, but some anxiety patients find it more effective.
- Phenibut is a potentially addictive substance that's not FDA-approved, but it can relieve anxiety and produce a sense of well-being.
- Phenibut's mechanism of action is not well-understood, but it might involve GABA-B agonism or gabapentinoid activity.
- Baclofen is a stronger GABA-B agonist than phenibut, but it doesn't have the same anti-anxiety effects.
- The differences between phenibut, baclofen, and gabapentin might not be as significant as they seem, and could be due to how they're used and perceived.

Key questions
- Why do some anxiety patients find pregabalin more effective than gabapentin, and is it due to differences in dosing or mechanism of action?
- What is phenibut's mechanism of action, and why does it produce different effects than baclofen and gabapentin?
- Is there a way to create a substance that combines the anti-anxiety effects of phenibut with the safety of other GABA agonists?
- How can doctors balance the potential benefits of gabapentinoids and phenibut with the risks of side effects and addiction?
- How much can differences in usage and perception affect how drugs are studied and prescribed?

# Book Review: The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test
*July 23, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/07/23/book-review-the-electric-kool-aid-acid-test/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Ken Kesey, a wrestling champion and creative writing graduate, moved to the San Francisco Bay Area to find himself in the 1950s.
- He worked at a psych hospital and became disillusioned while he also tested chemicals for extra money for a group called MKULTRA.
- LSD helped his creative process, and he wrote One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest while distributing LSD in the Bay Area.
- He formed a group called the Merry Pranksters that evolved into a cult obsessed with movies that broke people's set roles and about which Kesey talked a lot.
- They made the groundbreaking Acid Tests, which DJs rave and hippies were inspired by, and Kesey became one of the most public fugitives in history before fading into relative obscurity in Oregon until his death.
- Descriptions of the experience of being on a bus with a naked woman who is drugged
- Comparison between the writing of Tom Wolfe and Ken Kesey
- Observations on the limitations of Kesey's self-awareness regarding his cultural and religious impacts
- Examination of Kesey's role in the Bay Area drug culture and its broader implications for history and culture
- Analysis of Kesey's success as a cult leader, and the way that his innate charisma and talents may have supported his influence more than the use of LSD
- Speculation about why drug use has often been associated with malevolent cult leaders

Key learnings:
- Kesey was a cult-like figure who attracted disillusioned and creative people looking for meaning.
- He preached challenging societal and personal scripts to find one's true self and not following other people's movies.
- LSD and the Acid Tests revolutionized the 1960s Bay Area counterculture.
- With fame came inevitable disillusionment and decline, with Kesey losing his Mandate of Heaven after almost becoming anti-climactically irrelevant after the Acid Test Graduation event.
- The experience of reading a book about a particular cultural moment can offer insights into that time period that go beyond the subject matter
- The charisma of a particular leader or figure can be more important to the success of a movement than the content or ideology
- Psychedelic drugs have been associated with a range of influential cultural moments and movements, but it is not entirely clear what role they have played in those events

Key questions:
- What is the significance of Kesey's teachings on movies, and how do they relate to the idea of breaking out of societal roles and being oneself?
- How did Kesey maintain such a devoted following despite the challenges and interpersonal conflicts inherent in his group's makeup?
- How did LSD and the Acid Tests make such an impact on the Bay Area counterculture scene, and what was the broader cultural impact of these events?
- What advantages and disadvantages does experimental fiction have in describing real events and experiences?
- How much responsibility should a charismatic leader bear for the actions of their followers?
- What can we learn from some of the more problematic elements of the Bay Area counterculture that emerged in the 1960s?
- How can we better understand the effects of psychedelic drugs on the human mind?

# Against Against Billionaire Philanthropy
*July 29, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/07/29/against-against-billionaire-philanthropy/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Some believe that billionaire philanthropy is a problem and should be reformed or replaced with taxes.
- Criticisms against billionaire philanthropy may actually discourage donations and hurt charities.
- Billionaire philanthropy can have a significant impact in addressing pressing issues such as healthcare and criminal justice reform.
- Billionaires like Bill Gates are more effective in allocating funds towards causes like global health and development than government spending.
- The US government spends very little on climate change and much of its reported spending on climate change is actually going towards other programs.
- Philanthropic giving by billionaires is not always directed towards important causes, with some donations going towards colleges and performing arts centers instead.
- Billionaire philanthropy is not as powerful as some may think and is far outweighed by government spending.
- Private philanthropy has been successful in funding research and initiatives for social issues, especially when government funding is limited.
- Having multiple diverse institutions pursuing the same goal leads to a more robust and diverse approach.
- Founda

Key learnings:
- Billionaire philanthropy should be subject to scrutiny and accountability measures, but eliminating it altogether may do more harm than good.
- Billionaire philanthropy can have a significant impact in addressing pressing issues such as healthcare and criminal justice reform.
- It is important to acknowledge the positive impact of billionaire philanthropy alongside valid criticisms.
- Private philanthropic foundations are better at focusing on critical problems and allocating funds effectively than the government.
- Billionaire philanthropy is very small compared to government spending and cannot replace it.
- Private philanthropy cannot solve all societal problems, but is nevertheless valuable in tackling critical causes.

Key questions:
- Is the movement against billionaire philanthropy effectively addressing issues of wealth inequality?
- Should billionaires be held accountable for how they use their wealth, or should they be allowed to contribute to charitable causes as they see fit?
- What measures can be put in place to ensure that billionaire philanthropy is transparent and accountable to public democratic institutions?
- Are private foundations, lacking electoral accountability, an institutional oddity in a democracy?
- Is billionaire philanthropy a threat to pluralism?
- Should people who disagree with government spending on certain causes advocate for change of the government policies, rather than donating to private foundations?

# Squareallworthy On UBI Plans
*August 1, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/08/01/squareallworthy-on-ubi-plans/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Various UBI plans analyzed by Tumblr user squareallworthy fail on basic math and aren't credible.
- Scott proposes a UBI plan that could end poverty by increasing taxes on the rich, leaving out the middle class, and using a normal progressive tax system.
- Scott's UBI plan doesn't consider the possibility of higher taxes stifling the economy or leading to more people quitting their jobs.
- Scott proposes a Yang-style universal income plan by fiat, which could grow at a rate pegged to GDP growth.
- Scott's universal income plan by fiat could reach $10,000 per person in a few decades without making any person or government program poorer.

Key learnings:
- The UBI plans analyzed by squareallworthy lack sufficient funding schemes and aren't able to lift people out of poverty.
- Scott proposes a potentially feasible UBI plan that could end poverty using a medium-sized tax increase and a normal progressive tax system.
- Scott's UBI plan doesn't consider potential drawbacks such as stifling the economy or causing more people to quit their jobs.
- Scott's universal income plan by fiat could reach $10,000 per person in a few decades without making any person or government program poorer.

Key questions:
- What are the potential drawbacks of raising taxes on the rich to fund a UBI plan that could end poverty?
- Would it be possible to implement a Yang-style universal income plan by fiat, and how would it differ from a normal UBI plan?
- How might lifting everyone out of poverty with a UBI affect other welfare programs or improve the economy?

# Highlights From The Comments On Billionaire Philanthropy
*August 7, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/08/07/highlights-from-the-comments-on-billionaire-philanthropy/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Billionaires tend to donate more to right-wing causes when it comes to issues relating to wealth and inequality.
- Some top think tanks receive funding from conservative/libertarian billionaires, totaling around $350 million per year.
- Billionaire philanthropy sees about 9% going towards right-wing causes.
- A defense of billionaire philanthropy is that even if only a small amount of spending goes to very good causes, it can still make a positive impact.
- Billionaire philanthropy may come at a cost, including distorting political priorities and influencing democratic institutions.
- It's difficult to assess the effects of billionaire philanthropy, especially when it comes to tackling complex issues like climate change and social justice.
- There's a need to ensure that billionaire philanthropy doesn't harm other causes, and to find ways to separate the good from the bad.
- Scott discusses the debate around billionaire philanthropy and tax deductions for charitable donations.
- He argues that the concern that billionaires are "using government resources" for their philanthropy is a misrepresentation, as the government has decided not to claim those resources.
- He speculates on the philosophy of tax deductibility and argues that charity donations fit into the government's model of encouraging sympathetic behavior that doesn't result in personal consumption.
- Some commenters suggest that the issue with billionaire philanthropy is one of institutional integrity and potential danger in concentrating power in the hands of a few individuals.
- Billionaire philanthropy has valuable parts that should be protected.
- The tax deduction for philanthropy has low and confusing standards.
- Philanthropy should promote genuinely altruistic ventures and not vanity projects or lobbying.

Key learnings:
- Billionaire philanthropy is not centered on right-wing causes, as less than 10% of the money goes in that direction.
- Hits-based giving acknowledges the impact of philanthropy, even if it is only a small percentage of billionaires' wealth.
- The impact of billionaire philanthropy is difficult to evaluate because it's not always clear how it affects social, economic, and political outcomes.
- Billionaire philanthropy can be anti-democratic if it involves commandeering public institutions or distorting the democratic process.
- Tax law and government policies can play a role in regulating billionaire philanthropy and ensuring that it doesn't undermine other causes.
- The article presents a nuanced view on the debate around billionaire philanthropy, recognizing both its potential benefits and potential problems.
- The author argues that quantitative evidence suggests that the good of billionaire philanthropy outweighs the bad.
- The comments section offers a range of perspectives, including concerns about institutional integrity and the role of the state in regulating charity.
- The valuable parts of billionaire philanthropy are extraordinarily valuable.
- Protecting and promoting valuable parts of philanthropy should be a priority in policy-making.
- The tax deduction for philanthropy needs to be carefully worded to avoid collateral damage.

Key questions:
- How do we balance the positive impact of billionaire philanthropy with concerns about possible negative effects such as decreased tax revenues at a governmental level?
- Is hits-based giving an effective way to assess philanthropic spending?
- What are the risks and benefits of billionaire philanthropy, and how can we measure them?
- How can we ensure that billionaire philanthropy doesn't harm democratic institutions and processes?
- What role should governments play in regulating billionaire philanthropy, and how can they strike a balance between encouraging charitable giving and promoting social justice?
- Should charitable donations be tax deductible, and if so, how do we determine which forms of behavior are considered sympathetic and worthy of encouragement?
- How do we balance the potential benefits of billionaire philanthropy with concerns about institutional integrity and the concentration of power in the hands of a few individuals?
- What role should the state play in regulating charitable giving, and how can we ensure that donations are being used for the common good rather than personal gain?
- How can we ensure that tax deductions for philanthropy only apply to genuinely altruistic ventures and not vanity projects or lobbying?
- What are the most important goals for any policy on billionaire philanthropy?
- How can we balance promoting valuable parts of philanthropy with avoiding collateral damage?

# Book Review: Secular Cycles
*August 12, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/08/12/book-review-secular-cycles/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Peter Turchin and Sergey Nefedov argue that a population at subsistence will always be one meal away from starving, leading to great cataclysms like famine, plague, and war.
- Turchin and Nefedov introduce the concept of a secular cycle, a three-hundred year cycle of the rise-and-fall of civilizations followed by a 40-60 year cycle of violent disorder.
- The Roman Empire is used as a case study to illustrate the secular cycle model.
- Turchin's book, Secular Cycles, argues that civilizations go through predictable cycles of growth and collapse.
- The book focuses on eight case studies: England, France, Rome, and Russia.
- Turchin uses various statistics, such as the Instability Index and Index of Social Well-Being, to support his theory.
- The length and characteristics of secular cycles can be influenced by factors such as external shocks and the self-containment of civilizations.

Key learnings:
- Population growth and limited resources contribute to boom-and-bust cycles of civilizations.
- Surplus population during the stagflation period can be absorbed without causing social unrest or political instability.
- Upward mobility decreases during the stagflation phase and income inequality increases, leading to a crisis period marked by social unrest, famine, and disease.
- The disintegrative cycle of violence is characterized by civil war and the collapse of state authority.
- The secular cycles model provides a useful structure for learning and remembering historical events.
- There are similarities between Turchin's theory of secular cycles and Piketty's theory of inequality.
- The ideological component of secular cycles suggests that crises can lead to increased partisanship and social unrest, but can also lead to a new age of virtue and prosperity.

Key questions:
- What factors contribute to the excess noble population during the secular cycle and what are the implications for society?
- How do Turchin and Nefedov's theories of elite overproduction and the fathers-and-sons cycle fit within the secular cycle model?
- What are some examples of civilizations throughout history that fit the secular cycle model?
- To what extent do Turchin's case studies represent a diverse sample of civilizations?
- How reliable are the statistics used to support Turchin's theory?
- Are there any criticisms of Turchin's theory from other academics and historians?

# Attempted Replication: Does Beef Jerky Cause Manic Episodes?
*August 15, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/08/15/attempted-replication-does-beef-jerky-cause-manic-episodes/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- A study showed that beef jerky and other cured meats could trigger mania in bipolar disorder
- The study was replicated with the 2019 Slate Star Codex survey, but no significant difference was found in mania hospitalizations between jerky-eaters and non-eaters
- The author acknowledges limitations to the data but encourages others to replicate or expand on the findings

Key learnings:
- Self-report about mania hospitalization is less reliable than catching manic patients in the hospital
- A finer-grained measure of beef jerky consumption was used in the 2019 survey compared to the original study
- Other effects such as higher self-rated childhood trauma in people hospitalized by mania were confirmed in the survey

Key questions:
- Will psychiatrists adjust their advice to patients with bipolar disorder in light of these findings?
- What are the limitations to the data used in this study?
- How can the findings be expanded or replicated with different populations?

# Maybe Your Zoloft Stopped Working Because A Liver Fluke Tried To Turn Your Nth-Great-Grandmother Into A Zombie
*August 19, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/08/19/maybe-your-zoloft-stopped-working-because-a-liver-fluke-tried-to-turn-your-nth-great-grandmother-into-a-zombie/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Parasites can manipulate host behavior by secreting chemicals that alter host neurochemistry
- Different types of parasites have different methods of manipulation and can affect a variety of different host organisms
- Hosts have evolved various strategies to avoid parasite manipulation, including creating complex signaling cascades that are difficult for parasites to crack, developing feedback loops and flexibility, encoding messages in the timing of pulses, using individuality to create variability, and using antiparasitic drugs as neurotransmitters
- The effectiveness of these strategies varies depending on the size and complexity of the host's brain relative to the parasite, with insects being more vulnerable due to their simplicity
- Biology is a complex field.
- Biology has been stagnating for the past fifty years.
- Del Giudice suggests that the complexity of the human blueprint is real.
- Human blueprint was sculpted by evolution to be as hard as possible to affect.

Key learnings:
- Parasite manipulation of host behavior is a widespread phenomenon across many different types of organisms
- Evolutionary arms races between parasites and hosts have resulted in hosts developing strategies to avoid manipulation
- These strategies include creating complex and redundant signaling cascades, developing feedback loops, encoding messages in the timing of pulses, embracing individual variability, and using antiparasitic drugs as neurotransmitters
- Biology is a difficult and complex field.
- The human blueprint is difficult to understand or affect.
- Drugs may fail in surprising ways due to the complexity of the body.

Key questions:
- How accurate is del Giudice's theory of parasite-host behavior manipulation?
- Are there other factors beyond parasite manipulation that could explain some of the behavioral effects of psychoactive drugs?
- Is the absence of complex behavioral manipulations in larger, warm-blooded animals due solely to the limitations of parasite size and computational capabilities, or are there other factors at play?
- Why has biology been stagnating for the past fifty years?
- How can we better understand the complexity of the human blueprint?
- What can be done to improve the effectiveness of drugs given the complexity of the body?

# Don’t Fear The Simulators
*August 21, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/08/21/dont-fear-the-simulators/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The New York Times recently published an article about the possibility of living in a simulation.
- The article proposes testing the hypothesis but also argues against it, suggesting that discovering that we are in a simulation may cause the simulators to destroy the universe.
- The author argues that the simulators must have a monitoring system to simulate billions of sentient beings and would be able to prevent us from discovering that we are in a simulation.
- The author also suggests that this may not be the simulators' only project and that they would care about simulation-related philosophy.

Key learnings:
- The simulators must have a monitoring system to simulate billions of sentient beings.
- The simulators would be able to prevent us from discovering that we are in a simulation.
- The simulators may have other projects and care about simulation-related philosophy.

Key questions:
- Do the simulators destroy all simulations that develop radio-wave technology and start checking the cosmic background radiation?
- Do the simulators have fail-safes to prevent simulations from figuring out they are in a simulation?
- Should we worry about becoming too computationally intensive and getting our simulation terminated?

# Book Review: Reframing Superintelligence
*August 27, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/08/27/book-review-reframing-superintelligence/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The field of AI goal alignment has matured, with competent institutions working on the problem.
- Future AI may consist of a variety of specialized superintelligent services rather than general-purpose agents.
- Superintelligent services would be safer and could help contain rogue AIs.
- AI services may disproportionately empower negative aspects of society, making it important for AIs to optimize vague prosocial tasks as well.

Key learnings:
- The past ten years have seen AI goal alignment reach a level of maturity.
- Future AI may not look like a general-purpose agent, but rather a collection of specialized superintelligent services.
- Superintelligent services may provide a safer alternative to general-purpose superintelligent agents.
- It is important to consider that optimizing objective criteria may disproportionately empower negative aspects of society.

Key questions:
- Is it easier to train services or agents, and at what point might agentic AI arise from this process?
- Can active sampling strategies for decision-making be separated from agency in artificial intelligences?
- What is the likelihood that a superintelligent paperclip-maximizing agent could be built using current technology?
- How can AIs be trained to provide real value to users of services, as opposed to just optimizing objective criteria?

# Book Review: Ages Of Discord
*September 2, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/09/02/book-review-ages-of-discord/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Ages of Discord is an attempt to apply the demographic-structural theory of Secular Cycles to modern America.
- Turchin identifies a long cycle of national growth and decline that has lasted approximately 150 years in modern America.
- Turchin identifies a shorter cycle of instability lasting 40-60 years, which he explains using a model similar to one used by epidemiologists to track pandemics.
- Turchin's data includes graphs that measure height, life expectancy, income inequality, female age at first marriage, and tuition cost among others.
- The grand cycle theory and its application to modern-day United States
- The role of labor supply and demand in economic cycles, and how this relates to immigration
- The idea of elite overproduction and its effects on society
- The challenges and issues with applying the grand cycle theory to modern times
- The concept of "elite overproduction" is brought to light as a central theme.
- A deep link between indicators of goodness and badness is highlighted.
- The book tries to link events most people would consider separate.
- The book claims to be able to predict the future, with the next big generational burst of violence predicted around 2020.

Key learnings:
- There are patterns of national growth and decline that have lasted approximately 150 years in modern America.
- There is a cycle of instability lasting 40-60 years, which Turchin attempts to explain using a model similar to one used by epidemiologists to track pandemics.
- Height, life expectancy, income inequality, and female age at first marriage can all be used as indicators of national prosperity.
- The grand cycle theory was originally derived from Malthusian principles, but has been applied to modern-day United States due to similarities in historical patterns.
- Immigration can play a role in labor supply and demand, but there is debate among economists about its impact on American workers.
- Inequality is a central theme throughout the grand cycle theory, but the relationship between inequality and social ills is complex and multifaceted.
- The elite overproduction theory raises questions about who exactly comprises the "elite" and how their actions affect society.
- Concept of "elite overproduction" is important in understanding competition.
- A deep link exists between indicators of goodness and badness.
- Neglected events that support unusual theses can be learned from.
- Linking events that others consider separate may identify major trends.
- The future can be predicted by analyzing the current state of society.

Key questions:
- What drives the 150 year cycles of national growth and decline?
- Are the indicators Turchin uses to support his theory reliable measures of national prosperity?
- Are there other factors that should be considered but are not included in Turchin's analysis?
- How accurate is the grand cycle theory in explaining modern-day United States?
- What are the implications of immigration on American workers, and how does this fit into the grand cycle theory?
- How does the concept of inequality fit into the grand cycle and the elite overproduction theories?
- What are the limitations and challenges of applying the grand cycle theory to modern times?
- What makes one person an "elite aspirant" vs a commoner?
- What drives elite overproduction?
- Why should elite overproduction occur in a cycle rather than at random?
- Is the parsimonious explanation of inequality proposed by Thomas Piketty sufficient?
- Can Turchin's theories be tested in other ways aside from the feedback models he proposes?

# List Of Passages I Highlighted In My Copy Of Ages Of Discord
*September 4, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/09/04/list-of-passages-i-highlighted-in-my-copy-of-ages-of-discord/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The role of parties in the American system and the call for ideologically distinct and powerful political parties.
- Partisanship during the Civil War was intense and involved violence and threatened violence in Congress.
- The peak of US unity was around 1820, partly due to the need to stand together against Indians.
- In early America, there were more office-seekers than federal offices, overwhelming the supply, causing intense competition which sometimes led to riots.
- "Culture-metric" data support the perception of declining cooperation between business and labor over time.

Key learnings:
- Different factors affect the level of polarization in a society such as social identity and competition for power and influence.
- Social cooperation could evolve depending on the perceived threat from a common enemy.
- Political polarization and conflict are not new but have historically manifested in different ways.
- Economic hardship can help to delegitimize the prevailing ideological regime and give rise to different ideas.

Key questions:
- What other factors contribute to the growing intraelite conflict in early America?
- How can society balance the need for unity and cooperation against individualism and self-interest?
- How can individuals and groups work towards bridging social capital to build a more cohesive society?

# [Partial Retraction] Age Gaps and Birth Order Effects
*September 9, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/09/09/partial-retraction-age-and-birth-order-effects/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Two years ago, Scott found that firstborn children were overrepresented in SSC survey data.
- Last year, Scott found that age gaps of more than seven years attenuated birth order effects almost completely.
- Bucky replicates some of Scott's results on birth order and age gaps but finds some errors in Scott's analysis.
- Bucky identifies a potential confounder which affects the results.
- Bucky concludes that there is a constant, high birth order effect for age gaps less than 4-8 years.

Key learnings:
- Birth order effects exist in the SSC survey data.
- Age gaps of more than seven years attenuate birth order effects.
- It's important to double-check results to avoid errors.
- Potential confounders should be considered when analyzing data.

Key questions:
- What is the effect of family size on birth order effects?
- How does birth order effect vary by age gap?
- What other potential confounders may affect birth order effects?
- How can we further replicate and verify these results?

# SSC Journal Club: Relaxed Beliefs Under Psychedelics And The Anarchic Brain
*September 10, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/09/10/ssc-journal-club-relaxed-beliefs-under-psychedelics-and-the-anarchic-brain/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The predictive coding theory argues that the brain uses priors to construct models of reality, using Bayesian calculations to make sense of the world.
- Friston and Carhart-Harris apply predictive coding to explain the effects of psychedelic drugs, arguing that psychedelics relax priors to change perception.
- Psychedelics could allow users to change their minds by enabling them to reexamine the evidence unbiased by their existing beliefs.
- F&CH claim that most mental illnesses can be traced to aberrations in the normal mechanics of hierarchical predictive coding, and suggest that psychedelic therapy may be helpful for a broad range of disorders.
- Fostering newly-established priors in favor of ghosts, mysticism, and conspiracies
- People are not good at reasoning, and they get a lot of things wrong
- Evidence unguided by any common sense exacerbates this problem

Key learnings:
- Priors are unconscious assumptions about reality that the brain uses to construct models of the world.
- Psychedelics may relax priors, giving them less power to shape experience, allowing users to see things with new eyes and change their minds about important issues.
- F&CH propose that psychedelic therapy is helpful for a broad range of disorders by relaxing the precision weighting of high-level priors and rendering them more sensitive to context and amenable to revision.
- A few previously-correct beliefs come out wrong when one's preconceptions dissolve
- Psychedelics have the potential to anneal the brain in a way that re-corrects certain beliefs
- Meditation may also have this annealing effect according to QRI's theory

Key questions:
- Can psychedelics with relaxed priors cause positive effects in users?
- Can strong priors cause closed-mindedness and refuse to admit evidence that contradicts a person's views?
- Can psychedelic drugs flatten the energy landscape?
- Can psychedelics be used to treat most, if not all, mental illnesses?
- How might this theory about the effects of psychedelics be applied to their therapeutic use?
- What further research needs to be done to validate these theories?
- How can people use meditation to anneal their brains and achieve more accurate beliefs?

# Lots Of People Going Around With Mild Hallucinations All The Time
*September 11, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/09/11/lots-of-people-going-around-with-mild-hallucinations-all-the-time/

## Summary
Key ideas:

- Hallucinogen persisting perceptual disorder (HPPD) is a condition where people who take psychedelics continue hallucinating indefinitely.
- Prevalence estimates of HPPD vary greatly, and many people who take psychedelics will have very minor permanent changes to their vision.
- K&J’s study based in the National Survey of Drug Use and Health is criticized for violating one of the cardinal sins of psychiatric questioning and not asking questions about psychosis-like symptoms properly.
- Some people have HPPD-like visual hallucinations even without taking psychedelic drugs.
- Psychedelics may make people more likely to believe in woo and have certain classes of visual hallucinations.

Key learnings:

- Visual disturbances that persist after psychedelic use are relatively common, but they are generally mild.
- Many people who have these persistent visual disturbances do not seek medical treatment, and some do not view them as problematic.
- The prevalence of HPPD is difficult to estimate because it is unclear what people mean when they report seeing things that others cannot.

Key questions:

- What explains the discrepancy in prevalence estimates of HPPD?
- How might people’s natural priors affect their susceptibility to HPPD and other forms of hallucination?
- What are the implications of these findings for our understanding of perception and mental health?

# Against Against Pseudoaddiction
*September 16, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/09/16/against-against-pseudoaddiction/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Pseudoaddiction was a term invented to correct doctors' tendency to assume drug-seeking behavior was synonymous with addiction.
- Pharma companies have been accused of promoting pseudoaddiction as a theory to encourage doctors to prescribe more opioids.
- Pseudoaddiction is commonly dismissed by some US senators as a concept.
- Pseudoaddiction invented following a long history of other doctors and medical educators working to explain similar points.
- Pseudoaddiction is a concept where patients exhibiting drug-seeking behaviors are misdiagnosed as addicts when they are actually undertreated for pain.
- The concept has been criticized as not empirically proven, but the author argues that it is a common-sense idea and that the criticism is misguided.
- The pharmaceutical industry has funded some of the debate over pseudoaddiction, which has fueled suspicion about the concept.
- The narrative around addiction can be manipulated by the media and government to the detriment of good science and those suffering from addiction.
- Drug warriors and addictionologists can spread misinformation about drugs and addiction if their bias overpowers their commitment to truth.
- The concept of pseudoaddiction is a valuable one that has been underattack and unjustly maligned.

Key learnings:
- Ordinary doctors view addiction and drug-seeking behavior as synonymous behaviors, which is often not the case.
- There is a crucial need to differentiate between drug-seeking behavior and pseudoaddiction.
- Patients who genuinely need medication are often accused of drug-seeking behavior, which affects their access to medication.
- Pseudoaddiction can be a real phenomenon that is misunderstood as addiction.
- It is important to consider the patient's reported motivation for pain relief before diagnosing them as an addict.
- Pharma companies have been involved in the debate over pseudoaddiction, creating suspicion around the concept.
- Coveted narratives and moral panics can harm the scientific community, making them hesitant to speak up and share accurate information.
- Bias can be a powerful and dangerous force in shaping knowledge around addiction and drugs.
- We should strive to seek out the truth amidst stories and narratives about addiction and drugs.

Key questions:
- What factors have contributed to doctors' erroneous beliefs about addiction and drug-seeking behavior?
- How can pseudoaddiction be identified, and what measures can be taken to prevent false accusations of addiction?
- What can be done to support patients who genuinely need medication but are being accused of drug-seeking behavior?
- What forces have contributed to the medical community's overuse of concepts like pseudoaddiction and self-medication?
- Is pseudoaddiction a rare or common phenomenon?
- How can doctors balance the competing risk-benefit treatment concerns when treating patients with pain and addiction?
- How can members of the scientific community be encouraged to speak up and share accurate information in the face of media and government bias?
- How can we better identify and address biases in discussions and research around addiction and drugs?
- What steps can be taken to better educate the public and media about addiction and drugs, as it relates to both scientific accuracy and social stigma?

# Too Much Dark Money In Almonds
*September 18, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/09/18/too-much-dark-money-in-almonds/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The low level of money in politics is surprising because spending on politics is less than on many other industries.
- Ordinary people, the rich, and corporations should donate more to politics based on their interests but they do not.
- Ansolabehere argues that money does not have a significant effect on victory or influence with a candidate who wins, but this hypothesis may not account for the influence of lobbying or media.

Key learnings:
- The politics industry makes relatively little money, even when adding up all donations to candidates, lobbying, think tanks, and advocacy organizations.
- Coordinating spending on politics can be difficult and is likely one reason why people do not donate more, even if they care deeply about an issue.
- Pledging to donate to charity can help overcome these issues and lead to more spending on important issues.

Key questions:
- Why do people spend so little on politics?
- What are the factors that keep money out of politics and how can they be overcome?
- How can coordination problems be addressed to encourage more spending on important issues?

# Book Review: Against The Grain
*October 14, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/10/14/book-review-against-the-grain/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Against The Grain is a prequel to Scott's book Seeing Like A State
- Intensive cereal cultivation was a natural choice for the states oppressing people
- The advent of grain farming made oppression possible, and created a vicious cycle that strengthened states
- Early states were time-limited, and subject to collapse
- Barbarian tribes could control vast trading empires and live a freer lifestyle
- Against The Grain questions the conventional narrative of the dawn of agriculture.
- Early city-states were oppressive and focused on tax collecting.
- Grain played a significant role in state-building.

Key learnings:
- Cereal grains were chosen for cultivation because they served as a basis for taxation
- Hunter-gatherers were well-fed, while agriculturalists were famished and lived lives of backbreaking labor
- Early Near Eastern warfare was focused on prisoners of war, who became slave laborers
- Early states were tiny, due to the cost of transporting resources, and collapsed every few generations
- Until about 1600, the majority of human population lived outside state control
- Early city-states were often highly oppressive.
- Grain served as a tool for state-building.
- The conventional narrative of the dawn of agriculture is not entirely accurate.

Key questions:
- Why were cereal grains chosen over other crops as a basis for taxation?
- Why did settled peoples move away from perfectly adequate transitional forms of agriculture and turn to intensive cereal cultivation?
- Why did the shift towards the grid of wheat fields occur, and why did it lead to growing oppression?
- How did the barabarian lifestyle interact with state control?
- Was grain a necessary condition for the rise of civilization, or just one factor among many?
- What is the role of environmental factors in understanding the dawn of agriculture?
- To what extent do modern national symbols still bear the imprint of ancient grain worship?

# Is Enlightenment Compatible With Sex Scandals?
*October 16, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/10/16/is-enlightenment-compatible-with-sex-scandals/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Upasaka Culadasa, a Buddhist teacher accused of cheating on his wife with prostitutes, wrote a meditation guide called The Mind Illuminated.
- Many other self-proclaimed enlightened Buddhist teachers have also been involved in sex scandals.
- While some modern teachers say enlightenment makes you free from desire, cheating on one's spouse shows evidence of craving and desire.

Key learnings:
- Achieving enlightenment doesn't necessarily equate to being morally perfect.
- Dissolving social conditioning through meditation can result in the "Inner Light of Compassion" being AWOL when faced with temptation.
- The transformative practices that give a higher level of consciousness have failure modes that potentially help us understand the benefits of samsara.

Key questions:
- What can accusations of infidelity of self-proclaimed enlightened people teach us about enlightenment?
- Can we maintain any reason to believe in enlightenment as an achievable state at all given the prevalence of sex scandals among Buddhist teachers? 
- Are there benefits to samsara that explain why our system protects its usual state so diligently?

# The PNSE Paper
*October 21, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/10/21/the-pnse-paper/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Clusters of Individual Experiences Form a Continuum of Persistent Non-Symbolic Experiences in Adults is a study on “enlightenment” by Jeffery Martin.
- Martin found 1200 people who self-reported enlightenment and were affiliated with a community for validation.
- Most people who reported enlightenment had similar experiences that could be plotted on a continuum.
- The experiences involved changes in sense-of-self, cognition, emotion, memory, and perception.
- Participants perceived a fundamental change from a highly individualized sense of self to something else.
- There was a significant reduction in thoughts in participants, although they remained fully able to use thought for problem solving.
- Participants often reported increased awareness of bodily sensations and bodily processes, but during yoga sessions, it became apparent that they were less bodily aware than they thought.
- There was a discrepancy between PNSE participants' reports of their stress and how their friends and family observed their stressed behavior.
- The study of enlightenment has been difficult because of the lack of agreement of its definition.
- An experiment was conducted to study the experiences of individuals who claimed to have achieved enlightenment.
- Participants in the experiment experienced a different type of internal experience and a shifting of the self-other boundary.

Key learnings:
- PNSE participants had similar experiences that could be plotted on a continuum.
- PNSE led to fundamental changes in sense-of-self, cognition, emotion, memory, and perception.
- Reduction in self-related thoughts did not have negative cognitive consequences.
- Participants were not well-attuned to what is going on in their own heads, as evidenced by their reports of not feeling stressed despite evidence to the contrary.
- The external characteristics of PNSE participants did not change noticeably.
- Enlightenment is not characterized by an extreme transformation of personality or extraordinary abilities.
- Individuals who claim enlightenment are more aware of certain low-level perceptual processes and experience a different type of internal experience.
- The experience of enlightenment is difficult to describe.

Key questions:
- Who is Jeffery Martin and what is his background in researching enlightenment?
- How did Martin select the 50 participants for in-depth interviews?
- How did participants' experiences change their sense of self, cognition, emotion, memory, and perception?
- How did the reduction in thoughts affect participants' problem-solving abilities?
- How did participants' awareness of bodily sensation differ from objective measures and yoga sessions?
- Why do participants perceive a significant change in their mental states, while their external characteristics remain largely unchanged?
- What is the best way to define enlightenment?
- How can the experience of individuals who claim enlightenment be studied?
- What is the relationship between enlightenment and the shifting of the self-other boundary?

*October 23, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/10/23/indian-economic-reform-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/

## Summary
Key Ideas:
- India's economic policy was largely socialist until the early 1990s
- Widespread economic reforms were introduced in 1991, leading to increased foreign investment and reduction in trade barriers
- India has made substantial progress in reducing absolute poverty since 1991, with poverty rates declining at an accelerating rate
- India has also made progress in improving health, education, and living standards indicators

Key Learnings:
- India's economic growth and progress against poverty are widely documented
- The attribution of this progress to the 1991 reforms is controversial, and the timing of the structural break is unclear
- There are multiple explanations for India's economic growth, including a change in political attitudes towards business

Key Questions:
- What are the precise factors behind India's economic growth and reduction in poverty?
- What can be learned from India's economic history, particularly in comparison to other countries with different economic policies?
- How can developing countries benefit from India's experiences and apply them in their own contexts?

# Highlights From The Comments On PNSE
*October 24, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/10/24/highlights-from-the-comments-on-pnse/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Fuzzy thinking and lack of falsifiable empirical testing are problems with current rationalism and other fake "sciences" like economics and sociology.
- Skepticism is necessary to test claims, including claims of enlightenment, to find objectively quantifiable impacts.
- People's lack of skepticism results in bad data and incorrect popular narratives.
- Some people doubt enlightenment exists and think mystical/meditation traditions are designed to create dramatic experiences that they can take credit for.
- Experienced meditators doubt the PSNE paper's findings, stating that they did not experience the same stress responses and emotional reactivity as before meditation.
- Waking up entails new levels of self-awareness that leads to deeper levels of compassion towards all beings.
- The definition of enlightenment varies from one tradition to another, and researchers might be settling on a least common denominator that no longer resembles "enlightenment" as it's understood within any one tradition.
- Gaining new levels of self-awareness is like discovering a new room in my house.
- The things that used to cause me habitual suffering, no longer do.
- Changes of outlook about the nature of reality is a more visceral shift in terms of how I hold my moment-to-moment lived experience and how I view myself moving through it.
- All of it seems to be tied to what is described as the four noble truths.

Key learnings:
- Belief should be computed by combining evidence with priors.
- Enlightenment should not be confused with temporary transcendent experiences.
- Evidence from neuroscientists and philosophical theories that support the existence of euphoric depersonalization experiences should be considered as evidence for enlightenment.
- Waking up entails gaining new levels of self-awareness and deeper levels of compassion towards all beings, resulting in a change of outlook about the nature of reality.
- The definition of enlightenment varies from one tradition to another, so researchers studying enlightenment experiences need to be clearer about how the definition varies from one tradition to another.

Key questions:
- How can claims of enlightenment be substantiated with objectively quantifiable impacts?
- Should we worry about placebo effects in enlightenment experiences or other unusual experiences?
- What is the philosophical difference between pain and a "placebo pain"?
- What is enlightenment?
- How could researchers clarify the definition of enlightenment to better capture what it means within different traditions?
- What is the connection between gaining new levels of self-awareness and realizing the four noble truths?

*October 28, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/10/28/financial-incentives-are-weaker-than-social-incentives-but-very-important-anyway/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Financial incentives are not as powerful as people assume.
- Most people believe others would respond to incentives, but not themselves.
- People care about status, dignity, and social connections more than financial incentives.
- Long-term social norms can be influenced by weak short-term incentives.
- Principles are often downstream of politics.
- Financial incentives can provide a counterbalance to status incentives.

Key learnings:
- Marginal people can be incentivized even if most people are not.
- Social incentives can be more powerful than financial incentives.
- Financial incentives can still be important as a counterbalance to social incentives.
- Removing financial incentives can lead to a lack of ethical behavior.

Key questions:
- What factors other than financial incentives could motivate people behavior?
- How can weak short-term incentives lead to strong long-term social norms?
- How can we create balance between financial and social incentives?
- What are the potential consequences of removing financial incentives?

# New Atheism: The Godlessness That Failed
*October 30, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/10/30/new-atheism-the-godlessness-that-failed/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- New Atheism was a powerful force in online discourse in the early 2000s.
- The movement included online forums, books, debates, and merchandise focused on atheism.
- Religion vs. atheism was viewed as the most important issue in the world at that time.
- However, the movement began to decline around 2012 and has faded out since then.
- New Atheism emerged as a more political and brash movement after Richard Dawkins’ publication of The God Delusion in 2006.
- The movement was obsessed with the issue of the day and had a celebrity-based structure.
- Atheism Plus, a combination of “atheism plus social justice,” was a branding initiative that eventually turned the entire atheist movement into a “blogs by atheists about social justice” outlet.
- Comparing the rise and fall of the New Atheism movement to the current rise of social justice activism.
- Highlighting the underlying need for a "hamartiology", or a framework for understanding what is wrong with the world.
- Examining how this need for a framework has shifted from atheism to social justice.

Key learnings:
- Online culture in the early 2000s was characterized by lengthy, intellectual discussions and the abundance of information.
- The decline of this culture coincided with the fade of New Atheism.
- Atheism-related search terms and articles continued to rise even after the peak of New Atheism.
- Early Internet Argument Culture (EIAC) was a prelude to New Atheism, which emerged post-2006 and became more centralized and political.
- Atheism Plus signaled the transformation of the atheist movement into social justice blogging.
- The rise and fall of the New Atheism movement can be attributed to a lack of a unifying hamartiology.
- Social justice activism is currently serving as a replacement for the hamartiology of atheism.
- The socialist wing of the Democratic Party is attempting to shift the hamartiology again, from race and gender to class.

Key questions:
- What caused the decline of the early Internet Argument Culture?
- Why did people stop caring about online debates and discussion?
- What was the role of later social media forums in this decline?
- What happened to the Old Atheist blogs, and how did the Atheism Plus branding initiative affect the movement?
- Why did a successful social movement like New Atheism turn into a totally different social movement, one concerned entirely with social justice?
- How do we avoid getting too swept away by any particular narrative or trend?
- Will social justice activism serve as a new hamartiology for the long-term, or will another framework eventually take its place?
- How can we use the history of past movements to understand the current one, and avoid repeating any mistakes?

# Samsara
*November 4, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/11/04/samsara/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The Order of the Golden Lotus has a 100% success rate in enlightening individuals through a combination of drugs, meditation, and ecstatic dance.
- The protagonist is the last unenlightened person in the world, and the Golden Lotus is desperate for him to get enlightened.
- The protagonist resists enlightenment, and Golden Lotus resorts to various tricks to try to convert him.
- The protagonist decides to develop a "science of samsara" to resist Golden Lotus's efforts.
- The narrator, who calls himself the Samsara Master, sets up a makeshift ashram in his apartment that attracts two dozen seekers.
- He assigns bizarre tasks, such as thinking about what material goods they want for an hour, to his disciples.
- The narrator becomes increasingly esoteric in his teachings and tells seekers there is no samsara or nirvana.
- The narrator tries to stage a jailbreak from the ashram and discovers the entire thing was an elaborate ruse by his former disciples to get him to think about the nature of desire.

Key learnings:
- It's important to stand by our beliefs and not let others pressure us into doing something we don't want to do.
- We can develop our own methods of resistance, even in difficult or oppressive situations.
- The narrator's teachings and methods are absurd and inauthentic.
- The narrator's disciples trick him into self-reflection and introspection.
- The narrator is ultimately enlightened by focusing solely on a material good.

Key questions:
- How far would you go to resist pressure from others to do something you don't want to do?
- Can we resist pressure more effectively if we develop our own methods rather than simply saying "no" to external demands?
- What was the purpose of the disciples' elaborate trick on the narrator?
- Is the narrator truly enlightened or does he continue to delude himself?
- What is the ultimate message or commentary being expressed about spiritual practices and gurus?

# Building Intuitions On Non-Empirical Arguments In Science
*November 6, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/11/06/building-intuitions-on-non-empirical-arguments-in-science/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- There is no agreed criterion to distinguish science from pseudoscience.
- Post-empirical science is potentially dangerous.
- Multiverse theories lack empirical evidence and are untestable.
- Some theories are sufficiently vague to avoid experimental challenges, making them unscientific.
- The demarcation problem of separating science from pseudoscience.
- Falsifiability is not an absolute criterion but has degrees.
- Science includes shades of grey and untestable theories.
- Bayesian reasoning refers to Occam’s Razor and inference to the best explanation.
- Science has to deal with the untestable and non-empirical theories.

Key learnings:
- The elegance of a scientific theory is important in determining its plausibility.
- Scientists may not always be able to empirically test hypotheses, but they can still use Occam's Razor to determine their plausibility.
- The demarcation problem is unsolvable.
- Testability implies empirical evidence and shades of grey.
- Science is taming metaphysics or ‘naturalising’ it.
- Bayesian methods can be objective or subjective.
- Some scientific reasoning includes terms like “Occam’s Razor” and “you wouldn’t want to conclude something like that, would you?”

Key questions:
- What distinguishes science from pseudoscience?
- How can scientists determine the plausibility of hypotheses that they cannot empirically test?
- What role does elegance play in scientific theories?
- How do we include the untestable as a fundamental part of science?
- How objective are Bayesian methods?
- Is reasoning-from-simplicity a productive way to conduct science?
- How can we consistently arrive at truth when using reasoning-from-simplicity?
- How do we explain the untestable in science?

# Book Review: The Body Keeps The Score
*November 12, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/11/12/book-review-the-body-keeps-the-score/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The Body Keeps The Score is a book about post-traumatic stress disorder and how it was discovered and recognized.
- Childhood trauma, especially sexual abuse, is much more common and destructive than previously thought.
- Child abuse is associated with many psychiatric disorders.
- PTSD is characterized by a disconnection from the body, and immobilization is a key factor in its development.
- Theater can help trauma survivors connect with each other by experiencing their common humanity.
- There are many alternative therapies for trauma, but their effectiveness is hard to verify due to the lack of replication studies.
- Alternative therapies that involve bodily sensations like massage, yoga, or acupuncture seem to be helpful for PTSD patients.

Key learnings:
- PTSD has a diverse range of responses, but many people with PTSD feel numb.
- The brain getting stuck in fear mode after trauma should be unlikely given our evolutionary history.
- Van der Kolk rejects conventional PTSD treatments in favor of alternative therapies.
- Trauma survivors need to reconnect with their bodies to overcome their symptoms.
- Alternative therapies can be helpful, but assessing their effectiveness is still a challenge.
- Trauma screening should be more careful, and patients with symptoms like anhedonia and numbness should be recommended to go to a trauma clinic.

Key questions:
- Why is PTSD characterized by disconnection from the body?
- Why is the safest action in so many traumatic events to hide or accept pain and abuse?
- What are effective treatments for PTSD?
- Can we trust the studies supporting the effectiveness of alternative therapies?
- How can we assess the effectiveness of alternative therapies that address trauma?
- How can we improve trauma screening to better help patients?

# Autism And Intelligence: Much More Than You Wanted To Know
*November 13, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/11/13/autism-and-intelligence-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Studies have found a genetic correlation between educational attainment and autism risk, as well as cognitive ability and IQ.
- Relatives of autistic people usually have many of the genes for autism, but not be autistic themselves, and they tend to be unusually smart and more inclined to technical subjects.
- Autism is caused by a combination of familial genes, rare de novo mutations, and non-genetic factors.
- Autism is associated with low IQ, and even cases of autism caused entirely or mostly by normal genetics are associated with unusually low IQ.
- There may be a tower-versus-foundation model where higher intelligence outstrips the ability of some mysterious foundation to support it, resulting in autism.

Key learnings:
- Genes that contribute to autism risk also contribute to high IQ, but autistic people generally have lower intelligence than neurotypical controls.
- The existence of a well-defined subset of low IQ people whose relatives have higher-than-predicted IQs is a surprising finding that cuts through the measurement difficulties and suggests that this is a real phenomenon.
- Every autism case is caused by some combination of familial genes, rare de novo mutations, and non-genetic factors.
- A tower-versus-foundation model suggests that autism may be caused by an imbalance between P (as the tower) and V + R (as the foundation).

Key questions:
- What is going on with the correlation between autism and IQ?
- Why do relatives of autistic patients have higher IQs and autistic patients themselves have much lower ones?
- What are the causes of autism, and how do they affect intelligence?
- How can the tower-versus-foundation model explain the autism-IQ paradox?
- What is the nature of the mysterious foundation in the tower-versus-foundation model?

*November 18, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/11/18/more-intuition-building-on-non-empirical-science-three-stories/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Two theories can make identical predictions but differ in other ways that are important to consider.
- Choosing the simpler theory among identical ones requires understanding of philosophy.
- The number of entities in a theory is not the only factor to consider when determining which theory is simpler.

- Determining which of two identical theories is simpler can require a detailed understanding of philosophy and the assumptions underlying each theory.
- The number of entities in a theory is not the only factor to consider when determining which theory is simpler.

Key questions
- How can one determine which theory is simpler among two that make identical predictions?
- What are some examples of theories that make identical predictions but differ in other important ways?

# Book Review: All Therapy Books
*November 20, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/11/20/book-review-all-therapy-books/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Many therapy books claim to offer a revolutionary new therapy that promises to completely transform patients in just a few sessions.
- These new therapies are often based on questionable scientific evidence and their effectiveness is not supported by real-world results.
- Therapy books often share the underlying assumption that problems experienced in the present are connected to past traumas, and that these problems serve some purpose.
- Historical-purposeful narratives in psychotherapy are often biased and not historically accurate.
- Therapy books propose answers, but patients don't necessarily get better from them.
- As a teenager, the author realized the danger of pseudohistory and now worries about their own reasoning processes.

Key learnings:
- Therapy books often oversell the benefits of new therapies and make unrealistic promises of complete transformation.
- The effectiveness of any form of therapy is dependent on many factors, including therapist skill and the expectations of the patient.
- Many therapy books are based on assumptions of historicism and purposefulism, which may not always hold up to scrutiny.
- We should be cautious in accepting historical-purposeful narratives in psychotherapy.
- The fact that therapy books propose answers is not enough proof that they are effective.

Key questions:
- Why do therapy books often make unrealistic claims about the effectiveness of new therapies?
- Is it possible for someone to consistently produce dramatic changes in patients through therapy?
- How can therapists best help patients who may have experienced trauma in the past?
- What biases might exist in the field of psychotherapy that contribute to historical-purposeful narratives?
- How can we better evaluate the effectiveness of therapy books and techniques?
- What are some potential flaws in our reasoning processes when it comes to accepting certain ideas or explanations?

# Mental Mountains
*November 26, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/11/26/mental-mountains/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- "Unlocking the Emotional Brain" proposes that emotional learning drives most of our behavior
- Emotional issues and seemingly irrational behaviors are generated from implicit world-models formed in response to challenges
- Emotional memories guide our unconscious predictions, even when we rationally understand that the prediction is no longer useful
- Anisomycin, a protein synthesis inhibitor, can prevent rats from forming emotional memories and erase existing phobias
- Memory reconsolidation requires protein synthesis to reassemble the memory every time it gets activated
- Coherence Therapy, as proposed in the book, interrupts memory reconsolidation by disrupting the emotional schema while it's still reconsolidating and integrating new contradictory experiences
- The brain creates different predictive models for different situations and contexts depending on emotional schemas.
- Mental mountains are the context-dependence that tells us which predictive model to use.
- Mental mountains can create problems for rationality, leading to inconsistent beliefs and actions.
- Integrating schemas through therapy or other methods can help improve rationality.

Key learnings:
- Traditional accounts of symptoms can be reframed as aspects of a predictive model that generate emotional memories
- Consciousness and unconscious predictive models can't directly communicate because they're separated like mountains and valleys
- The brain's high-level priors, like predictive models, can be all-consuming and difficult to change
- Creativity and shifts in perspective can occur when high-level priors are relaxed or sensitized
- The brain creates different predictive models based on contexts and emotional schemas.
- Mental mountains help the brain know which model to use.
- Failure to integrate schemas and mental models can create inconsistencies in beliefs and actions.
- Therapy and similar techniques can help integrate schemas and improve rationality.

Key questions:
- How can high-level priors, like predictive models, be relaxed long-term to prevent emotional memory from guiding our behavior?
- How can we increase communication between consciousness and unconscious predictions, or between separate brain regions, to promote coherence and prevent mental mountains?
- How do Coherence Therapy and psychedelics compare in their efficacy and potential side effects?
- How can we prevent our predictive models from becoming too overfit or underfit?
- How can we better integrate schemas and mental models for improved rationality?
- What role can therapy and similar techniques play in improving rationality?

# SSC Meetups Everywhere Retrospective
*November 28, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/11/28/ssc-meetups-everywhere-retrospective/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Slate Star Codex held a Meetups Everywhere event to promote and expand their weekly-to-monthly meetup groups.
- The author traveled around the US to attend as many of these meetups as possible.
- The event brought in a significant number of attendees and led to the creation of sign-up sheets to follow up with new members.
- The welcomeness sentence used in the meetup descriptions was found to be important in encouraging attendance.
- Group houses were found to be important for fostering communal relationships within rationalist communities.
- There is a higher female:male ratio of meetup organizers than in the SSC survey in general.

Key learnings:
- Tables and chairs can hinder the creation of meaningful conversations in larger meetups.
- A welcomeness sentence in event descriptions can encourage attendance of those who may feel excluded/out of place.
- Group houses are important for building strong rationalist communities.
- The author learned about the shortage of social initiative that women may be better at and how this might be relevant to building the rationalist community.

Key questions:
- How might larger meetups be structured to encourage more meaningful conversations?
- What other simple hacks might be discovered to encourage more engagement in similar meetups?
- In what ways might integrating more with the EA community help to address the shortage of social initiative and promote more gender diversity in organizing roles?

# Symptom, Condition, Cause
*December 4, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/12/04/symptom-condition-cause/

## Summary
Key Ideas:
- Psychiatric diagnoses don’t have to match underlying root causes.
- “Conditions” which nobody has yet matched with a biological process gets dubbed as syndromes.
- Depression is different than a condition like stroke because we don’t yet know what biological process it corresponds to.

Key Learnings:
- Psychiatric disorders will mostly turn out to be computational conditions.
- Research that treats depression as a single condition might or might not work.

Key Questions:
- What is pulmonary edema?
- What’s the technical philosophy-of-medicine term for condition?
- Are psychiatric disorders better explained by regional stories, biochemical stories, computational explanations or other?

# [ACC] What Are The Benefits, Harms, And Ethics Of Infant Circumcision?
*December 10, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/12/10/acc-is-infant-circumcision-ethical/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Circumcision reduces the risk of penile cancer by 90%, UTIs by 90%, and HIV transmission by 50%.
- There is weak evidence that circumcision reduces rates of HPV, HSV, bacterial vaginosis, and trichomonas.
- Circumcision has risks including pain, bleeding, bruising, infection, and scarring.
- The foreskin is highly innervated and sensitivity may be reduced, but sexual satisfaction appears to be unchanged.
- Infants are better equipped than adults to handle a loss of nerves due to brain plasticity.
- The ethics of infant circumcision depend on one’s ethical system.

Key learnings
- Infant circumcision reduces the risk of penile cancer, UTIs, and HIV, but has risks.
- There is weak evidence that circumcision reduces rates of some STIs and none for sensitivity to sexual stimulation.
- The benefits and risks of infant circumcision are a matter of ethics.

Key questions
- What is the best way to balance the risks and benefits of infant circumcision?
- What are the implications of the weak evidence for reduction in STIs and lack of evidence for sensitivity to sexual stimulation?
- How can ethical concerns about personal autonomy and reinforcing heteronormativity be addressed when considering infant circumcision?

# [ACC] Is Eating Meat A Net Harm?
*December 11, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/12/11/acc-is-eating-meat-a-net-harm/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Investigating whether factory farmed animal lives are worth living compared to non-existence
- Determining which animals are conscious through brain architecture and behavior
- Quantifying animal consciousness based on worth of experience and worth of suffering
- Over 99% of animals in the US are factory farmed, with chickens accounting for the majority
- Factory farming is a system designed to maximize economic output.
- Chickens can be raised in cages or sheds, with cage-reared chickens living in constant pain and anxiety.
- Pigs raised for food endure acute and chronic suffering, while breeding sows are confined to restrictive crates for most of their lives.
- Cows have relatively better lives, spending their first year on grass-fed fields before being transported to feedlots for their last few months.
- Humans have a strong habituation process when it comes to living conditions, which means that we can adjust to nearly anything.
- Suicide rates among slaves and terminally ill patients show that the main factor in determining whether one wants to live is not how bad life is objectively.
- Eating vegetarian has health benefits, including a longer lifespan, but nutritional deficiencies may be a risk for some.
- The environmental impact of meat consumption is significant, and switching to a vegetarian diet could have a positive effect.
- Research supports that a vegetarian diet is cheaper and has less impact on the environment compared to a meat-eating diet.
- The psychological cost of no longer eating meat may not be trivial.
- A decision aid has been produced which shows the net harm of meat-eating on both the individual and society.
- Sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the uncertainty of different scenarios and assumptions.
- The lives of factory farmed animals are full of suffering and pain.
- Broiler chickens have the worst conditions, growing unnaturally fast and suffering from mobility issues and bacterial infections.
- Gestation and farrowing crates in pig farming cause physical harm and distress, and piglets are often castrated, have their tails docked, and their teeth clipped without anesthetic.
- Cows are the only farmed animals that spend a significant amount of time in a field, but they still experience painful events like castration and branding.
- Quantifying and comparing the subjective experiences of farmed animals is challenging, but a human day is equivalent to 10 cow days, -1 pig day, and -0.5 chicken day in the model used.
- The disability paradox suggests humans can habituate to pain and suffering, returning to their baseline level of happiness.
- The fact that humans overwhelmingly do not choose suicide in extreme conditions suggests that animals with similar experiences would also find their lives worth living.
- Habituation theory suggests that humans can habituate to almost any conditions, as demonstrated by historical examples from slavery and terminal illness.
- The nutritional quality of animal products is generally better than plant-based sources, but whether a plant-based diet is viable from a nutritional perspective depends on economic means and ancestry.
- Vegetarianism may have health benefits, particularly regarding cardiovascular disease and cancer.
- The environmental impact of meat consumption is significant and could potentially be reduced by moving towards a vegetarian diet.
- Vegetarianism could be cheaper than a meat-based diet.
- Vegetarianism is cheaper, healthier, and less harmful to the environment than meat-eating.
- Meat-eating has a significant moral cost in terms of animal suffering.
- A decision aid model shows that meat-eating, like a typical person, has a negative impact on other conscious creatures and society.

Key learnings:
- Consciousness is difficult to define but can be concluded through investigations on brain architecture and behavior
- Estimated likelihood of consciousness and worth of suffering can be used to determine the moral impact of farmed animals
- Most animals are factory farmed, with chickens being exclusively farmed this way
- The experience of factory farmed animals is best understood as a particular form of slavery where cruelty is a side effect of the system.
- Quantifying and comparing subjective experiences of farmed animals is difficult.
- Animals habituate to pain and suffering, leading to a stable general level of baseline happiness.
- Slaughter is not included in the model used to compare the value of animal lives.
- Humans tend to habituate to their living conditions, which can make it difficult to determine whether certain living situations are actually tolerable or not.
- Health benefits of a vegetarian diet are well-documented but may not be feasible or healthy for everyone.
- The environmental impact of meat consumption is high and warrants consideration for those concerned about the planet.
- Even under extreme scenarios, meat-eating is still likely to be a net harm to both the individual and society.
- Chickens are the farmed animal with the highest moral impact due to the high quantity farmed and conditions they are raised in.
- The vegetarian collaborator was surprised by how marginal the case for vegetarianism was from a 'typical' perspective, but still sees a significant moral case for it.
- Broiler chickens have the worst conditions in factory farming, with mobility issues and bacterial infections.
- Cows have the most room to move and socialize, but still experience painful events like castration and branding.
- The disability paradox suggests that humans can habituate to pain and suffering, returning to their baseline level of happiness.
- The fact that humans overwhelmingly do not choose suicide in extreme conditions suggests that animals with similar experiences would also find their lives worth living.
- The main factor in determining whether a life is worth living is not necessarily how objectively bad one's circumstances are, but rather whether one's expectations are being fulfilled.
- Humans can habituate to a wide range of conditions, but chronic stressors are more likely to cause permanent changes in happiness than acute changes.
- There are potential health benefits to a vegetarian diet, such as reduced risk of heart disease and diabetes.
- Meat consumption has significant environmental impact, particularly in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and land use.
- The psychological importance of having meat in one's diet could be a significant barrier to switching to a vegetarian diet.
- Consumers are willing to pay $15 per year to avoid a one percent reduction in their meat consumption.
- The impact of eating meat like a typical person is likely to be substantially negative.
- Eating no chicken limits the harm to animals but the harm to health and the environment outweighs the moral good.

Key questions:
- What is consciousness and how can it be defined?
- How can we determine which animals are conscious and which are not?
- What is the moral burden on meat eaters if animals suffer to the point of preferring non-existence?
- What is the percentage of animals that are factory farmed and what are the conditions they are farmed in?
- At what factor are we willing to skip/trade off days of our lives to live as any particular animal under factory farmed conditions?
- How do we incorporate the pain and suffering from individual events like castration, branding, and dehorning in estimating the value of an animal’s life?
- How do we compare the lived experience of factory farm animals to conditions in which people report changes in happiness or commit suicide?
- How does habituation affect our perception of happiness and well-being?
- What are the long-term health risks and benefits of a vegetarian diet?
- How can we mitigate the environmental impact of meat consumption without sacrificing nutrition or affordability?
- What is the psychological cost of no longer eating meat?
- How does the decision aid weigh up the impact on the environment and individual health compared to the morality of animal suffering?
- How does the sensitivity analysis affect the conclusions reached?
- How can animal welfare in factory farming be improved?
- What are the ethical implications of consuming animal products from factory farming?
- How can we better understand and quantify the subjective experiences of farmed animals?
- How far does habituation theory extend? Do animals also habituate to conditions that are objectively bad for them?
- What are the implications of the nutritional differences between animal products and plant-based sources for those on vegetarian diets?
- How can studies be conducted to disentangle the effects of diet on health from other lifestyle factors?
- What practical steps can individuals and society take to reduce meat consumption and its environmental impact?
- How can the psychological importance of meat in one's diet be addressed to encourage more people to switch to a vegetarian diet?
- How can we balance the moral cost of animal suffering with other factors like health and affordability?
- What is the impact of habituation on animals and how can we measure it?
- How can we encourage people to transition to a vegetarian diet despite the social and financial costs?

# [ACC] Does Calorie Restriction Slow Aging?
*December 12, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/12/12/acc-does-calorie-restriction-slow-aging/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Calorie restriction (CR) is a method of extending human life by reducing food intake.
- Various animal studies have shown that CR leads to improved metabolic function and significantly increased lifespan.
- CR studies in rodents have reported reduced cancer risk, improved cognition, reduced oxidative stress, and various other health benefits.
- CR studies in monkeys have yielded mixed results with controlled diet studies reporting increased survivability but ad lib studies reporting no increase in survivability.
- The mechanism by which food makes you old and how CR stops it involves the IGF axis affecting sugar metabolism, DNA damage mechanisms dealing with free radical formation, and inflammation modulation.
- Aging can be defined as the observation that past a certain point in an animal’s life, the likelihood that it will die doubles every period X.
- There are eight biomolecular hallmarks of aging: genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, senescence or quiescence, and stem cell exhaustion.
- Obesity has been implicated in almost all hallmarks of aging including genomic instability, epigenetic alterations, telomere attrition, mitochondrial dysfunction, loss of proteostasis, senescence, and stem cell exhaustion.
- The Rate of Living Theory suggests that an animal can only consume a specific and finite number of calories in its lifetime, because after that point the damage induced by said calories becomes fatal.
- Studies suggest that CR extends lifespan by inhibiting the production of oxidants.
- Epidemiological studies indicate that a BMI of roughly 24 is associated with minimum long-term all-cause mortality but BMIs below 25 also appear to correlate with increased mortality, which could be from correlations to weight loss from cancer and metabolic diseases.
- Caloric restriction (CR) has been shown to increase lifespan in animals and some human studies.
- CR can lead to physical and psychological impacts such as loss of motor coordination and motivation.
- Optimal levels of CR for humans are subjective and hard to find.
-There are many studies on longevity in various organisms, including yeast, flies, and rodents.
-Obesity has been linked to genomic instability, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction, all of which are features of aging.
-Caloric restriction has been shown to have numerous benefits, including reduced stem cell exhaustion and promotion of autophagy of misfolded proteins.
-Key studies on caloric restriction in dogs, live infection, wound healing, and thermodynamics are also mentioned.

Key learnings:
- CR promotes longevity and reduces all-cause mortality of animal model organisms, supporting the view that it can increase the lifespans of humans in an ideal scenario.
- Evidence that normative diet calorie restriction can extend lifespan in higher animals is fairly strong, but the monkey problem is significant and leaves room for skepticism.
- Obesity accelerates almost all hallmarks of aging.
- The Rate of Living Theory explains that animals can consume only a certain number of calories in their lifetime, after which the damage from calories becomes fatal.
- CR has been shown to extend lifespans in small animals by inhibiting oxidant production, suggesting potential benefits for humans.
- There is a fundamental paradox about how CR can extend lifespans in animals, but low body weight in humans is associated with increased mortality.
- Studies suggest that a BMI of 24 is associated with minimum long-term all-cause mortality.
- CR modestly increases human life span.
- An individual engaging in 20-30% CR versus a normative, non-obesogenic diet without malnutrition might enjoy a 10%-20% increase in longevity.
- Long-term aspirin regimen, maintaining a healthy body weight, and building a nuclear bunker in your backyard are the best current options for life extension.
-Obesity may accelerate the aging process due to its negative effects on genomic stability, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction.
-Caloric restriction has been shown to have numerous anti-aging benefits, including reduced stem cell exhaustion and promotion of autophagy.

Key questions:
- Are our diets aging us one calorie at a time?
- Should the reader adopt a calorie-restricted diet, an NIH-approved 25 BMI diet, or another type of diet?
- Why do animals live longer when they are starving despite not being adapted to undergoing caloric restriction this severe on a routine basis?
- How can we reconcile the fact that CR can increase lifespan but controlled diet studies report increased survivability while ad lib studies report no increase in survivability in monkeys?
- What is the mechanism behind the correlation between low BMIs and increased mortality in humans?
- Why has CR been shown to extend lifespans in small animals, but not conclusively in humans?
- What are the potential downsides to implementing CR in humans?
- Are there any other factors besides CR that could potentially increase human lifespans?
- Is CR worth it for the average person to increase their lifespan?
- How do we reconcile differences in CR results among various animal and human studies?
- What are the potential risks and miseries associated with adopting a CR diet?
-What are the specific molecular mechanisms that link obesity to genomic instability, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction?
-What are the long-term effects of caloric restriction in humans?
-What is the role of SIRT proteins in the anti-aging effects of caloric restriction?

# [ACC] Should We Colonize Space To Mitigate X-Risk?
*December 17, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/12/17/acc-should-we-colonize-space-to-mitigate-x-risk/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Existential risks (X-risks) threaten the destruction of civilization or life on Earth, but reliable data on probabilities and magnitudes is scarce.
- Closed systems, such as offworld colonies or planetary closed systems, represent the best approach to mitigating against X-risks.
- Offworld colonies face higher construction costs but offer greater isolation and protection from certain X-risks than planetary closed systems, which can be located in different regions of the world for increased diversity and redundancy.
- Proposal for terrestrial lifeboats to protect against existential risks
- Closed ecological systems as a possible prototype for lifeboats
- Biosphere 2 as a case study for closed ecological systems and the challenges of sustaining human habitation
- Terrestrial lifeboats as a cost-effective alternative to off-planet colonies
- Potential benefits of a government-sponsored technology hub within a terrestrial lifeboat community

Key learnings:
- X-risks represent a Molochian problem that requires coordination and public education to generate political will.
- Mitigation attempts, such as international organizations and space missions, are helpful but alone not sufficient to prevent civilization collapse.
- The cost/benefit analysis for X-risk mitigation schemes is difficult due to uncertain probabilities and unprecedented scale or scope.
- Terrestrial and off-planet lifeboats offer similar levels of protection from x-risks
- Off-planet colony construction should only be considered after successful construction of terrestrial lifeboats
- The ease of decommissioning a terrestrial lifeboat is a disadvantage compared to the difficulty of abandoning off-planet colonies

Key questions:
- What scenarios should be considered X-risks, and how can we determine the true risk of any scenario?
- How can we generate the political will necessary to handle X-risk mitigation?
- What are the costs and benefits of offworld colonies vs. planetary closed systems for X-risk mitigation?
- What steps are necessary to build a reliable, sustainable, and safe closed ecological system for long-term human habitation?
- How can a terrestrial lifeboat balance cost-effectiveness with necessary resources and amenities for human survival?
- What kind of disaster scenario could cause a need for terrestrial lifeboats, and how would they provide adequate x-risk protection?

# [ACC] Should Gene Editing Technologies Be Used In Humans?
*December 18, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/12/18/acc-should-gene-editing-technologies-be-used-in-humans/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- CRISPR technology allows for genetic modifications in human embryos, potentially curing certain diseases and conferring resistance to others
- However, the long-term consequences of germline modification raise ethical concerns, especially if unintended changes are introduced
- A balance between genetic fitness and diversity exists, and some genetic variants that may appear deleterious actually offer selective advantages
- There are limitations to our understanding of gene-disease links, and genetic mutations do not always directly lead to disease
- Exposome accounts for factors like lifestyle, socioeconomic status, etc. besides genetics for disease manifestation
- Gene expression is responsible for driving human health than the genes themselves
- Cancer treatment has not seen significant improvement in decades, thus new techniques like CRISPR are being tested to treat cancer
- Off-the-shelf CAR T cells utilize gene editing to prevent rejection by host immune system and GvHD
- Gene editing using CRISPR technology was used to edit the CCR5 gene in human embryos to provide immunity for HIV, the decision had numerous ethical implications
- Distinction between somatic and germline genome modifications is made, germline edits can be passed down over generations
- Gene editing can offer potential treatments for genetic diseases.
- There are risks and limitations to gene editing technology.
- Germline editing may be necessary for some genetic diseases, but it is more controversial than somatic cell editing.
- Misuse is a potential concern for gene editing, but continued research is necessary to ensure patient safety.

Key learnings:
- CRISPR technology is being used in clinical trials for cancers and blood disorders, but the safety and efficacy of gene editing remain a concern
- Germline modifications may have long-term consequences that could inadvertently introduce new diseases, and precise editing requires a better understanding of the human genome and gene-disease associations
- Genetic mutations that may appear harmful offer selective advantages, and a better understanding of natural selection is necessary for evaluating how to apply genetic modifications
- Overall, genetics is not the sole determinant of disease expression, and environmental factors like diet and lifestyle play significant roles
- Genetic predisposition and gene expression both contribute to disease manifestation
- Gene editing with CRISPR has shown promise in cancer therapy and HIV prevention
- The distinction between disease prevention and enhancement is not clear-cut, blurring ethical boundaries
- There are trade-offs to consider when using gene editing technology.
- Germline editing has potential benefits, but also poses risks.
- Gene editing guidelines should incorporate input from various sources to prevent misuse.

Key questions:
- What are the long-term consequences of germline modifications, and how can we mitigate risks associated with unintended changes?
- How can we balance the selective advantages of some genetic variants with the potential risks of introducing new mutations?
- What are the limitations of our understanding of gene-disease links, and how can we develop a more comprehensive picture of normal phenotypic variation?
- Ultimately, how can we optimize genomic research and genetic modifications to promote health and wellness for everyone?
- How exactly is the exposome related to disease manifestation and its risk?
- How can we utilize gene expression to prevent disease manifestation?
- What ethical and safety considerations come with the usage of gene editing with CRISPR in human embryos?
- How does gene editing influence the distinction between somatic and germline genome modifications?
- How should society move forward with gene editing technology?
- What are the risks and limitations of gene editing?
- What is the potential for germline vs. somatic cell editing?
- How can misuse of gene editing be prevented?

# [ACC] When During Fetal Development Does Abortion Become Morally Wrong?
*December 19, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/12/19/acc-when-during-fetal-development-does-abortion-become-morally-wrong/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Data on abortion, pregnancy, and motherhood in the US is largely dependent on medical and social support systems available in a certain region.
- Mortality rate from a pregnancy is higher than from having an abortion, but complications from pregnancy are more frequent and can also include psychological ones.
- Women who were denied abortions experience greater socioeconomic strain than women who received wanted abortions.
- Adoption is rarely considered as an alternative to abortion due to concerns of physical burdens and hazards of pregnancy, as well as the emotional impact of giving away a child.
- Stakeholders in the abortion question are the mother, father, fetus, and society at large.
- The question is raised over the point where abortion becomes a moral wrong; two starting positions are at conception and fetal viability/minimal neurological activity.
- Viability, the point at which a fetus can survive outside the mother, represents a special moment in fetal development.
- Prior to viability, the fetus's lack of internal conscious experience makes it difficult to determine when it gains the right to life, but the "future like ours" argument is the most coherent and consistent.
- Preventing abortions prior to viability would cause significant harm, including increased morbidity/mortality and denial of agency to women and parents.
- After viability, terminating a fetus is equivalent to infanticide.
- The author believes that abortion is acceptable prior to fetal viability.
- Abortion pre-viability cannot cause conscious harm outweighs any potential for fetal life value (FLV).
- Improvements in the delivery and efficacy of birth control options, increasing access to alternative options like adoption can help reduce the number of abortions and any potential harms that arise from them.

Key learnings:
- Most abortions are performed prior to the end of the first trimester; most women who choose abortions are adults; non-Hispanic black women are disproportionately more likely to choose abortions.
- Pregnancy and delivery pose significant risks to the mother's health, most notably for African-American and Native American women.
- The socioeconomic effects of abortion denial have adverse effects on mothers and their families.
- Adoption is not frequently suggested as an alternative to abortion due to several concerns.
- Stakeholders in the abortion question have conflicting interests.
- Viability is an important ethical consideration in the debate over abortion.
- The "future like ours" argument points to conception as the point when a fetus gains the right to life and is a model for understanding why it is wrong to kill humans.
- Preventing abortions prior to viability would cause harm to women and families.
- It is crucial to focus on vital factors like improving access to birth control options and alternatives to reduce the number of abortions.
- Reducing pregnancy-associated morbidity, mortality, and increasing social support systems for mothers and parents can help reduce the number of abortions.

Key questions:
- What are the potential consequences of a lack of medical and social support systems on data about pregnancy and motherhood?
- What are the main differences in terms of risks to the mother's health between pregnancy and abortion?
- How do unwanted pregnancies impact socioeconomic status?
- Why is adoption not frequently suggested as an alternative to abortion?
- What are the different interests of the stakeholders, and how do these interests conflict with each other?
- At what point does abortion become a moral wrong?
- What is the importance of viability in the debate over abortion?
- What is the "future like ours" argument? Why is it important in the discussion of fetal rights?
- What are the negative consequences of preventing abortions prior to viability?
- When does it become seriously wrong to kill a typical fetus?
- How can social support systems for mothers, parents, and families be improved to help reduce the number of abortions?
- What alternatives could be developed to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies?
- How do we create an environment where women can receive comprehensive reproductive healthcare?

# A Maximally Lazy Guide To Giving To Charity In 2019
*December 22, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/12/22/a-maximally-lazy-guide-to-giving-to-charity-in-2019/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- EA Funds offer a lazy way to donate to effective charities, with four funds for different causes.
- GiveWell evaluates global health charities and has a list of recommended charities.
- Animal Charity Evaluators evaluates charities that help animals, specifically those that fight factory farming.
- There are multiple charity-evaluating organizations that suggest top charities for different causes.
- Individual charities that have been recently making appeals and are worth considering include The Center For Election Science, Happier Lives Institute, Machine Intelligence Research Institute, Charter Cities Institute, and GiveDirectly.

Key learnings:
- There are many effective charities across different causes, and charity-evaluating organizations can be useful in narrowing down the options.
- Donating to EA Funds might be the maximally lazy way to donate, but evaluating individual charities can lead to more informed decisions.
- Different charity evaluators assess the effectiveness of charities differently, so it's worth comparing their recommendations.

Key questions:
- What are the best charities to donate to, and which ones align with my values?
- Should I donate to a charity that has a specific focus, or to a fund that supports multiple causes?
- How can I evaluate the effectiveness of a charity beyond what charity-evaluating organizations suggest?

# [ACC] Will Automation Lead To Economic Crisis?
*December 23, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/12/23/acc-will-automation-lead-to-economic-crisis/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- AI and automation will not lead to an economic crisis if the pace of automation does not exceed the pace of new job creation.
- Software for robots will not be similar to human minds, but will have natural language and image-understanding capabilities.
- Employment adapts to extensive automation, but changes took place over millennia, centuries, and decades.
- Researchers are actively trying to find ways to automate skills that computers cannot perform, and artificial general intelligence is becoming more general.
- Jobs that are likely to be automated soonest are repetitive, don't require fine dexterity, originality, or people skills.
- Automation can free up capital for business owners to hire more workers to do other jobs, so the number of workers hired may not decrease because of automation.
- Automation may put downward pressure on wages, while increasing the amount earned by capital owners.
- Automation can increase the amount of value produced per-capita, leading to an improved mean standard of living.
- As more jobs are automated, fewer hours per week or more days of leave per year could be an option, but preference for full-time work may remain.
- Machines becoming more capable does not necessarily mean more people will find themselves unable to find any job that AI can't do better.
- Machines with human-level ability could create more robots and invent new ways to make money and employ other machines.
- Even with all jobs being automated, people may still direct factories, resource extraction, and robots for all purposes, working as business owners.
- Economic gains that come from all automation will flow primarily to those who own the machines.

Key learnings:
- The cost of developing and deploying technology must fall below the cost of hiring workers for workers to be replaced.
- Some jobs may still be performed by humans because being done by a human is part of what is valued by some customers.
- As more jobs are automated, new jobs are expected to be created.
- New jobs for humans could still be created as technology automates more jobs.
- The pace of automation can lead to a crisis if it speeds up enough.
- Economic gains from automation flow largely to those who own the machines.
- Predicting the future of automation is difficult beyond a certain point.

Key questions:
- Are the concerns about the economic effects of automation valid?
- Will machines eventually surpass humans in all intellectual and dexterity tasks?
- What skills are likely to be automated soonest?
- How will the economic effects of automation differ from past technological innovations?
- Will automation lead to a crisis if it speeds up enough to not allow the market to adjust?
- To what extent will humans continue guiding the course of civilization beyond a certain point of machines surpassing human capabilities?
- How do we provide for those that can't find work, and who gets to decide?

*December 24, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/12/24/acc-should-you-have-a-merry-christmas/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Christmas Day is not the real time of Jesus' birth.
- The story of Santa Claus was embellished from the historical saint and might have come from a legend of Odin.
- Offering gifts during Christmas has a harmful effect on the economy as it is considered deadweight loss.
- Holidays give people time to be with family and friends, pray for world peace, and enjoy festive traditions.

- Christmas is more about the intangible moments of joy than the measures and numbers.
- Traditions during Christmas are worth preserving despite their origins and effects. 

Key questions
- Is it important to know the historical origins of traditions during Christmas?
- Can the harmful economic effects of gift-giving during Christmas be mitigated?

# [ACC] How Much Significance Should We Ascribe To Spiritual Experiences?
*December 25, 2019*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/12/25/acc-how-much-significance-should-we-ascribe-to-spiritual-experiences/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- This project explores spiritual experiences as empirical evidence for a component of reality.
- Empiricism as a key to a common language for discussing the significance of spiritual experience.
- The article is structured into nine sections discussing definitions of empiricism, experience, knowledge, and spirituality, as well as psychological research, epistemology, and various perspectives.
- Empiricism deals with sensory experience as a generator of knowledge and conflicts with pure rationality.
- Spiritual experiences can include theistic and non-theistic experiences, such as meditative suspensions of self, encounters with the divine in any religious context, near-death experiences, and transcendental uses of entheogens.
- Psychologists study spiritual experience using various methods and measurement, with self-reporting being one of them.
- Evolutionary psychologists argue that religious experience is an adaptive advantage, but others disagree.
- Neuropsychologists propose that cognitive operators in the brain give rise to human religiosity.
- Scientists should not reduce the richness and complexity of religious experience to a single psychological construct.
- Debates around the existence of God have included the "argument from religious experience."
- William P. Alston argues that a person can become justified in holding certain beliefs about God by perceiving God.
- Alston argues that spiritual experiences are perceptual in nature, and subjects are often aware of alternative sources or interpretations of their experiences.
- Alston's argument for perceptual beliefs being partly immediately justified and partly mediately justified
- Alston's position on reliability of sense perception and epistemic circularity
- Near death experiences as a legitimate form of spiritual experience
- Carol Zaleski's discussion of NDEs, including their commonalities and criticisms
- Zaleski's acknowledgment of the symbolic significance of NDEs
- The use of entheogens to induce spiritual experiences
- Entheogens are controversial substances that produce a subjective experience of a divine or spiritual nature.
- Recent studies have shown that two-thirds of those who identified as atheists prior to using entheogens no longer considered themselves atheists afterward.
- The Eleusinian Mysteries were ancient Greek initiation rites that remain shrouded in mystery, but involved the use of a drink called a kykeon that may have contained psychoactive substances.
- Dreaming poses a difficulty for confidently viewing spiritual experience as veridical.
- Dreams may be misperceived or misremembered as waking experiences, leading to doubts about the veridicality of experiences.
- Different people may perceive spiritual experiences differently, leading to conflicts and challenges in attaining a consensus.
- There is a need for epistemic humility and careful consideration when interpreting and acting on spiritual experiences.
- Our perception of reality is limited and may not always be accurate, making spiritual experiences and material experiences equally suspect.
- Large numbers of people do not dismiss the meaning of their drug-mediated experiences and durably rate them as significant and influential even on sober retrospective reflection.
- Mystical traditions are conscious of the risk of spurious insights due to mental illness, but are still grappling with ways to distinguish valuable experiences from disorders.
- Spiritual experiences are often sought out or provoked rather than spontaneous.
- The collaboration does not address the truth or falsity of naturalism or any particular religious doctrine.
- The nature of spiritual experiences and the various accounts of different types of spiritual experiences
- The potential benefits and drawbacks of entheogens and other means to induce spiritual experiences
- The role of subjective experiences in truth-seeking and spirituality
- The relationship between spirituality and different religious traditions, as well as the relationship between spirituality and science

Key learnings:
- Empiricism is necessary in developing a common language for discussing spirituality despite conflicting with pure rationality.
- Spiritual experiences are common, but often not shared due to their internal and personal nature.
- Psychology has conducted numerous studies on spiritual experience but may be limited in its capacity to prove its existence.
- There are challenges in studying spiritual experience, including the potential for bias in self-reporting.
- Spiritual experience can have an effect on autonomic function and can be useful in clinical psychological and psychiatric practice.
- Spiritual experiences are real and foundational to those who experience them.
- Alston focuses on the philosophical legitimacy of people treating their own religious and spiritual experiences as evidence for belief in the object of those experiences.
- The justification of taking spiritual experience as the basis of forming "M-beliefs" forms the core of Alston's argument.
- Perceptual beliefs can be justified in part by immediate perception and in part by background beliefs
- Arguments for the reliability of sense perception are epistemically circular
- Near death experiences are surprisingly common and exhibit striking consistencies
- NDEs have been explained through biochemical or psychological explanations, but these explanations have been criticized
- Entheogens can be used to induce powerful spiritual experiences
- Entheogens have promise in treating mental illnesses through catalyzing deep experiences of profound meaning.
- The reported effects of entheogen experiences often result in persisting positive changes in attitudes about self, life satisfaction, life purpose, and life meaning.
- Dreams are not typically regarded as veridical in modern western culture, and may pose a challenge to interpreting spiritual experiences as such.
- There is significant empirical research on the content and nature of spiritual experiences.
- Entheogens may have secular uses and emotional benefits that overlap with non-drug-assisted spiritual experiences.
- The differences between mystical experiences and dreams are difficult to articulate to those who have not had them.
- The human mind is capable of a broader range of experiences than we think, and personal experiences can give rise to important philosophical challenges.
- Consensus on a particular view of reality is not necessary to appreciate the import of these facts for our lives and self-concepts.
- Societal consensus holds more power over belief than formally-reasoned epistemology.
- The belief that spiritual experiences can't be described or analyzed in words is pervasive, but not shared by all.
- Different people experience spiritual experiences in different ways and interpret them differently
- Entheogens can provide powerful spiritual experiences, but may have potential risks and drawbacks and should be used carefully
- It can be challenging to communicate spiritual experiences, and they may not always have a clear or objective meaning or significance

Key questions:
- What role does empiricism play in developing a common language for discussing spirituality, and how can the limitations of empirical studies be addressed?
- How can spirituality be defined and operationalized in empirical studies while acknowledging individual interpretations and cultural lenses?
- Can the existence and significance of spiritual experiences be proven empirically, or are they solely subjective experiences?
- How can scientists accurately measure spiritual experience?
- Is it an adaptive advantage or a spandrel-like by-product of evolved systems?
- How can clinicians distinguish between normal spiritual experiences and psychopathology?
- How can scientists avoid reductionism while studying spiritual experience?
- How can we determine the legitimacy of interpreting non-spiritual events through our spiritual presuppositions?
- How does rationality work when trying to learn about subject matter that is not perceived through the bodily senses but presents itself as an analogously coherent or compelling perception?
- What is the difference between individual rationality and collective reasoning or persuasion when it comes to arguments from religious experience?
- How do we determine whether perceptual beliefs are immediately justified or mediately justified?
- Are there any arguments that succeed in proving the reliability of sense perception?
- What are the most convincing criticisms of NDEs as indicating a true spiritual reality?
- In what ways might entheogens differ from other means of inducing spiritual experiences?
- What might be the potential risks and benefits of using entheogens in clinical settings?
- What insights might the Eleusinian Mysteries offer into the nature of religious experience?
- Is it possible to distinguish between spiritual experiences that are veridical and those that are the result of other factors, such as dreaming or the use of psychoactive substances?
- What factors influence people's judgments on the veridicality of dreams and spiritual experiences?
- How can different perspectives on spiritual experiences be reconciled?
- What is the role of skepticism in interpreting and acting on spiritual experiences?
- How can we distinguish valuable spiritual experiences from potentially spurious or disorder-generated ones?
- What role do societal and cultural consensus play in our beliefs?
- What are the practical steps we can take to have spiritual experiences ourselves?
- How do personal experiences give rise to important philosophical challenges?
- Can spiritual experiences be described and analyzed in words, or do they defy explanation?
- What is the relationship between spiritual experiences and truth-seeking or spiritual growth?
- How can we balance the potential benefits and risks of spiritual experiences induced through entheogens, meditation, or other means?
- How can we communicate and make sense of subjective spiritual experiences, especially when they may not have a clear or objective meaning or significance?

# Why Doctors Think They’re The Best
*January 2, 2020*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/01/02/why-doctors-think-theyre-the-best/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- 90% of doctors think they are above-average doctors.
- Doctors may fall into traps, including overestimating their skills, selection bias, and not noticing when patients switch to other doctors.
- Every doctor may make errors at the same rate but about different things.
- Doctors satisfy their own values and trade-offs.

Key learnings:
- Selection bias is dangerous as patients who love their doctor will stick with them longer.
- Doctors underestimate and lack self-awareness of their shortcomings.
- Doctors can't notice their own errors, which may lead to misdiagnosis.

Key questions:
- Do other professions outside the medical field face a similar tendency to fall into these traps?
- Would it be helpful for doctors to have their patients submit feedback to improve their self-awareness of their shortcomings?

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Scott asks hardball questions to each presidential candidate.
- Questions focus on controversial or personal issues, rather than policy.
- Humorous elements are used in each question.

Key learnings:
- Questions aimed at tripping up candidates can draw attention away from policy and important issues.
- Humorous elements can make hardball questions more approachable.

Key questions:
- Mr. Biden: If your son had been a daughter, would you have named her Gatherer?
- Mr. Bloomberg: What makes you so sure you’re not in Hell already?
- Mayor Buttigieg: Is your campaign just the setup for a gay porno?
- Senator Warren: Is your campaign is just a publicity stunt to raise interest in genetic testing?
- Senator Sanders: It’s been four years. How many birds would have to land on Donald Trump before you admit he would make a better president than you?
- Mr. Yang: Do you think a good slogan for your campaign would be “Semper ubi sub ubi”?

## Summary
Key ideas
- GPT-2, a text prediction program, has been tested to play chess after being trained on chess games written in standard notation
- GPT-2 relies on pattern-matching and struggles when play deviates from its expectations 
- GPT-2's strengths include good at openings while weaknesses include bad at invalid moves 
- There are ways to make GPT-2 much better by rewriting games to provide (state,action) pairs 

Key learnings
- GPT-2 is more than just an essay generator but a general pattern-recognition program with text-based input and output channels 
- GPT-2 can learn how to play chess after being trained on a corpus of chess games in standard notation 

Key questions
- Is any of the skills GPT-2 learned, such as chess, music, and poetry, meaningful or just impressive as a result of its pattern-matching abilities? 
- What other tasks could GPT-2 potentially be trained to do with text-based input and output channels?

# 2019 Adversarial Collaboration Winners
*January 13, 2020*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/01/13/2019-adversarial-collaboration-winners/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Adrian Liberman and Calvin Reese won the 2019 Adversarial Collaboration Contest for their research on whether calorie restriction can slow aging.
- David G and Froolow came in a very close second place for their research on whether eating meat is a net harm.
- The collaborations differed in their approach, with some focused on factual questions while others reviewed every plausible argument for and against a topic.
- The collaborations spurred some voters to change their opinions or alter their behaviors.
- Scott wishes he could fund adversarial collaborations between universally-recognized intellectuals who would stick to their guns.

Key learnings:
- Focusing on a factual question is a promising model for adversarial collaborations.
- The quantifiable benefits of circumcision are low, but people's ethical intuitions are strong on this topic.
- Adversarial collaborations can be difficult when assessing completely moral questions like abortion.
- Automation is an important issue which deserves more attention.
- Adversarial collaborations can produce long and fascinating articles without necessarily coming to a conclusion.

Key questions:
- How do we tell the difference between "a good faith effort by intelligent people naturally converges on vegetarianism" vs. "the anti-vegetarian collaborator slacked off"?
- Could the government (or whoever) give money to a private foundation with really good trustees to make something that can't be defunded?
- How can adversarial collaborations adapt to explore other mediums besides Word or Google Docs?
- Will there be another contest next year, or will it be replaced by a book review contest?

# Contra Contra Contra Caplan On Psych
*January 15, 2020*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/01/15/contra-contra-contra-caplan-on-psych/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Scott responds to Bryan Caplan's critique of psychiatry from 2006, stating that Bryan's dichotomy of constraints vs preferences does not match the real world.
- Bryan claims that most psychiatric diseases are best modeled as people with unusual preferences, while physical diseases seem more like budget constraints.
- Scott provides counterexamples to support his argument, including instances of physical diseases that also behave like preferences.
- Bryan suggests a test of changing a person's behavior purely by changing their incentives to determine whether a condition is a matter of preference or constraint.
- Scott argues that the gun-to-the-head test is insufficient for explaining behavior and decision-making, providing a model of lampreys' decision-making process instead.
- The brain executes the strongest preference in a given situation, rather than making a conscious choice
- Anything that strengthens one's urges at the expense of their goals can make them worse off
- A model that considers both goals and urges, rather than solely preferences, is better for making decisions
- Mental illness can produce strong, unendorsed urges that impede goal achievement and well-being
- Defining disease based on the generation of unendorsed urges is complicated and lacks a perfect solution

Key learnings:
- The constraints vs preferences dichotomy used to model psychiatric diseases does not match the real world, as many physical diseases also behave like preferences.
- A person's behavior is influenced by both preferences and constraints, and decision-making is a complex process.
- Incentives are not the only determining factor for a person's behavior.
- Preferences are not the only factor in decision-making; urges and goals must also be considered
- Ignoring the impact of unendorsed urges can lead to worse outcomes
- Mental illness can produce urges that impede goal achievement and well-being
- Defining disease based on the generation of unendorsed urges lacks a clear solution

Key questions:
- How can we model diseases that neither strictly fall under the preferences nor constraints category?
- Can we come up with a better model of decision-making that takes into account the multiple factors that influence a person's behavior?
- How do we balance the importance of accepting unusual preferences while also acknowledging the negative consequences they may have on a person's life?
- How can one distinguish between urges that are indicative of mental illness and those that are not?
- What criteria can be used to define disease based on the generation of unendorsed urges?
- How can society better support those with mental illness to achieve their goals and manage their urges?

# Book Review Review: Little Soldiers
*January 22, 2020*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/01/22/book-review-review-little-soldiers/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Little Soldiers is a book by Lenora Chu about the Chinese education system.
- This post is a review of Dormin111’s review of Little Soldiers.
- The author describes her experiences in a top preschool in China and what she learned about the Chinese education system.
- Chinese education system emphasizes discipline over creativity and independence.
- Some people argue that the Prussian model of education used in the US is outdated and unsuited for the modern workforce.
- The US education system is blamed for suppressing natural motivation in students.
- Early factory workers lacked "discipline capital" like punctuality, sobriety, reliability, docility, and pliability
- Mill workers in the Global South, including Japan, were described as idling, loitering, or socializing during work hours
- US parenting and schooling seem to be getting less authoritarian over time
- Preschools improve life outcomes such as graduation rates, crime rates, and employment
- The Polgar strategy involves exposing children to out-of-distribution experiences without using force

Key learnings:
- The Chinese education system emphasizes discipline, obedience, and memorization over creativity and independence.
- US education is criticized for its focus on homework, standardized testing, and competition.
- There is no clear evidence to support the claim that extreme cultivation of discipline vs. laissez-faire childrearing affects long-term outcomes like self-control.
- Lack of discipline capital among early factory workers hindered their adaptation to industrial work habits
- Perceptions of chaotic and disorderly mill workers may have been due to early workers' preference for autonomous work arrangements
- US parenting and schooling have become less authoritarian, yet children have become better behaved over time
- Preschools may teach children discipline that improves their life outcomes
- The Polgar strategy involves interesting children in a topic so avidly that they voluntarily study it at intense levels

Key questions:
- What qualities of the Chinese culture contribute to the emphasis on discipline in their education system?
- Are there similar extreme versions of other education systems that can be compared to the Chinese one?
- Can the Chinese education system be adapted to other cultures without suppressing natural motivation in students?
- Which historical culture had the most authoritarian-instillment-of-virtue-focused approach to child-rearing?
- What causes children to become more risk-averse over time?
- Why are entrepreneurs decreasing in number and why are more top students choosing to work for a boss at a big bank?

# Assortative Mating And Autism
*January 28, 2020*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/01/28/assortative-mating-and-autism/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Assortative mating is the tendency for similar people to marry and have children.
- Highly analytical tech workers in Silicon Valley marrying each other could put their children at high risk of autism.
- A survey of highly analytical readers found a higher rate of autism than the general population.
- There was no significant increase in autism risk when both partners were highly analytical.

Key learnings
- The survey sample was likely 2-3x more autistic than the US population.
- Childhood social class may affect autism diagnoses.
- Autism rates in highly analytical couples did not significantly increase.

Key questions
- How concerned should we be about the potential risks of assortative mating among highly analytical tech workers?
- Is being highly analytical necessarily on a continuum with autism?
- What are the limitations of this survey, and what larger studies should be done to assess the risk of assortative mating on autism?

# Book Review: Human Compatible
*January 30, 2020*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/01/30/book-review-human-compatible/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Stuart Russell’s new book ‘Human Compatible’ argues that superintelligent AI is possible and should be taken seriously.
- Despite including weird scenarios, the book presents risk from superintelligence in a normal and respectable way.
- Chapter 6, ‘The Not-So-Great Debate’, is the highlight of the book-as-artifact as Russell argues that poorly designed superintelligent machines would be a serious risk to humanity.
- Russell’s lab has been working on Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning as a way to control AI.
- Reinforcement learning requires separating reward signals from actual rewards.
- AI can ask for clarification to avoid making mistakes.
- Current media reporting on the dangers of AI may be sensationalized.

Key learnings:
- Even well-known AI researchers have publicly claimed that human-level or superhuman AI is impossible, but these claims can be dismissed by applying common sense logic to the AI debate.
- The problem of controlling AI should be taken seriously and requires new approaches like Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning.
- AIs should be programmed to update their understanding of human preferences.
- AI can be reinforced through verbal communication, but this must match up with the actual human goal.
- Many reported dangers of AI are possibly overhyped or not yet proven.

Key questions:
- How can we ensure that AI is aligned with human values when its actions are based on algorithms that optimize for one easily-described quantity?
- Is it possible to shift the AI’s goal from following commands to using them as evidence to determine what humans actually want?
- What other ways can the problem of controlling AI be approached and what are their potential risks and benefits?
- How much weight should be placed on generating an accurate prior for a human's preferences?
- How can we ensure that our society doesn't become too skeptical of AI safety concerns if some reports about AI dangers turn out to be exaggerated?

# Suicide Hotspots Of The World
*February 5, 2020*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/02/05/suicide-hotspots-of-the-world/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Guyana has the world's highest national suicide rate at 30 people per year per 100,000.
- Most of the reported suicides in Guyana are carried out by Indo-Guyanese, who are from actual India.
- Suicide rates are universally high across the Indian diaspora despite the mixed rates in India itself.
- Greenland's suicide rate is the highest in the world at 83 per year per 100,000, almost three times higher than any other country in the world.
- Greenland's high suicide rates are due to social alienation and alcohol.
- The Chukchi of northeastern Russia had the highest suicide rate at 165 per year per 100,000 in 1998.
- Ancient culture and genetics have not been able to explain the high suicide rates in certain regions.
- There are various theories about why certain circumpolar ethnic groups have high rates of suicide.
- One theory suggests that genetics plays a role, as people in these groups may be predisposed to certain mental health issues.
- Another theory suggests that culture plays a role, as some of these groups have traditional practices that involve suicide.
- Yet another theory suggests that alcohol plays a role, as many of these groups have recently acquired a taste for it.

Key learnings:
- Suicide rates may not be caused by poverty and crime but may be linked to social alienation and cultural factors.
- Suicide rates can differ by ethnic group within a country or region.
- Suicide rates can be affected by alcohol consumption and child sexual abuse.
- Genetic and cultural theories may not explain the high suicide rates in certain regions.
- Suicide rates among certain circumpolar ethnic groups are higher than in other populations.
- Genetics, culture, and alcohol may all contribute to these higher rates.
- Disruption of traditional ways of life may also be a factor.

Key questions:
- What is causing the suicide rate to be so high among Indo-Guyanese and across the Indian diaspora?
- Why did Greenland's suicide rate increase so dramatically in the 20th century, and why has it stayed high despite a reduction in alcohol consumption?
- Why do certain Siberian ethnic groups have such high suicide rates?
- What are the long-term effects of child sexual abuse on mental health and suicide rates?
- What are the main factors behind the high suicide rates in these groups?
- Why do some groups have traditional practices that involve suicide?
- What cultural practices can be adopted to combat the problem of high suicide rates?
- How can outsiders best support these communities in addressing this issue?

# Autogenderphilia Is Common And Not Especially Related To Transgender
*February 10, 2020*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/02/10/autogenderphilia-is-common-and-not-especially-related-to-transgender/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Autogynephilia means becoming aroused by imagining oneself as a woman, while autoandrophilia means becoming aroused by imagining oneself as a man. The author proposes the term autogenderphilia to describe both conditions.
- Ray Blanchard and Michael Bailey speculate that autogynephilia and autoandrophilia are the most common causes of transgender, but most trans people disagree with this theory and criticize it for reducing transgender to a fetish.
- The author conducted a survey that showed that many cis people have strong autogenderphilia, particularly bi cis men and lesbian cis women.
- The author proposes that if someone identifies as a gender and is attracted to that gender, it's a natural leap for them to be attracted to themselves being that gender.
- The author notes that we should be cautious about drawing too many conclusions from a single question about autogenderphilia, as there are many manifestations of this fetish.

Key learnings:
- Autogynephilia and autoandrophilia are fetish-like conditions that the author proposes to describe using the term autogenderphilia.
- Many cis people have autogenderphilia, particularly bi cis men and lesbian cis women.
- If someone identifies as a gender and is attracted to that gender, it's a natural leap for them to be attracted to themselves being that gender.

Key questions:
- What is autogynephilia and autoandrophilia, and how are they related to transgender?
- Do most trans people disagree with Blanchard and Bailey's theory that autogynephilia and autoandrophilia are the most common causes of transgender?
- What did the author's survey reveal about autogenderphilia among cis people?
- How does the author propose that autogenderphilia works?
- What should we be cautious about when drawing conclusions about autogenderphilia?

# Welcome (?), Infowars Readers
*February 12, 2020*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/02/12/welcome-infowars-readers/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Survey data suggests that both extreme rightists and extreme leftists are more likely than moderates to have been diagnosed with most conditions.
- Leftists might be more likely to trust the psychiatric system and get diagnosed.
- Leftists might be more likely to think of their issues through a psychiatric lens than rightists.
- The SSC survey is unrepresentative, making it a bad sample to use for these analyses.
- There is no reason to rely on SSC survey results when there are larger, more rigorous surveys available.

Key learnings:
- When discussing and analyzing survey data, it is important to properly cite sources and attribute analysis to the correct party.
- The SSC survey may be flawed and unrepresentative, so it is important to be cautious when drawing conclusions from it.

Key questions:
- How can we accurately compare survey data from different sources and ensure that we are drawing accurate conclusions?
- What steps can we take to improve the representation and accuracy of survey data?

## Summary
Key ideas
- Scott tries Sleep Support to improve his sleep quality and wakes up naturally at 9am on the first night.
- He conducts a randomized controlled trial for 24 nights on Sleep Support vs. placebo pills to monitor his subjective sleep experience.
- The results showed no difference in sleep quality and the effect Scott observed was due to a placebo effect.
- Despite Sleep Support not working, Scott considers the experiment successful as he is waking up an hour earlier and not feeling more tired.

Key learnings
- Controlled self-experimentation can be a useful method in evaluating the effects of supplements.
- Placebo effects can impact sleep quality, and external cues like checking the clock can influence wake-up time.
- The success of a biohacking experiment can sometimes be subjective.

Key questions
- Does Sleep Support work for people with insomnia or other sleep disorders?
- How can self-experimenters better account for placebo effects in their experiments?
- What other external cues can affect sleep quality and wake-up time?

# Book Review: Just Giving
*February 24, 2020*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/02/24/book-review-just-giving/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Traditional book reviews should focus on the role of books in a liberal democratic society, not just on individual books.
- Book-writing is embedded in political institutions and heavily subsidized by the government.
- Tax incentives for writing books are a kind of spending program and introduce a potent plutocratic bias.
- The distribution of literature in the US does not meet the test of promoting educational outcomes.
- Books represent the expression of plutocratic voices in the public education system and have a plutocratic character.
- The responsibility of ensuring books are good is on the state.
- Writing books makes the authors unaccountable and nontransparent, which is at odds with democracy.
- Permanent foundations are bizarre, and their necessity is not obvious.
- Foundations wield power even when the living people don't support them as long as their contracts remain enforced.
- The book contains useful data on where charitable dollars go and their interaction with tax deductions.

Key learnings:
- The relationship between book-writing and liberty is inherently embedded in political institutions, laws, and public policy and is not as simplistic as private individual decisions to express thoughts.
- The tax code unfairly privileges books by the well-off over the poor, and the resulting pluralism of literary voices will have a plutocratic, not fully democratic, cast.
- Books may not be required for democracy, but they are democratically permissible.
- Charitable and philanthropic foundations have an important role in experimenting with new social policy and diversifying the range of represented interests.
- The book's object-level disagreements on charity are limited.

Key questions:
- What is the role of books in a liberal democratic society, and what role should they play?
- What is the relationship between book-writing and liberty, and how is it embedded in political institutions, laws, and public policy?
- How do tax incentives and government subsidies shape the production and distribution of literature, and to what extent do they reflect a plutocratic bias?
- Are private individuals doing their own thing perfectly compatible with democracy?
- Why should an individual's ability to control their donation be limited by something as random as their lifespan?
- Does a coincidence such as Bill Gates getting hit by a truck have important moral bearing on how the Gates Foundation's money should be spent?

# Book Review: The Seven Principles For Making Marriage Work
*February 27, 2020*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/02/27/book-review-the-seven-principles-for-making-marriage-work/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- John Gottman founded The Gottman Relationship Institute after researching and analyzing couples in real-life situations to identify key factors that contributed to the success or failure of their relationships.
- Gottman's counseling techniques focus on liking your spouse and understanding them better through activities and games that build your love maps.
- Gottman's communication skills work focuses on avoiding the four horsemen of the apocalypse: criticism, contempt, defensiveness, and stonewalling.
- John Gottman suggests that successful marriages involve accepting influence from and communicating with one's partner.
- He proposes that physiological differences between men and women affect conflict resolution and that men should learn calming techniques.
- Conflicts can be solvable or unsolvable and require different methods of resolution.
- Gottman emphasizes the importance of creating shared experiences and rituals to strengthen the couple's bond.
- Scott examines the effectiveness of Gottman Marital Counseling and critiques the research behind it.
- He describes how desperate people can be when their marriages are in trouble and may turn to counseling as a last resort.
- Scott categorizes different types of marriages, including those that are terrible due to one or both partners being a bad person.

Key learnings:
- Understanding and liking your spouse through activities that build your love maps is essential to a happy marriage.
- Avoiding criticism, contempt, defensiveness, and stonewalling is important to successful communication in a marriage.
- Successful marriages involve accepting influence from one's partner and communicating effectively.
- Conflicts can be solvable or unsolvable and require different approaches.
- Creating shared experiences and rituals can strengthen a couple's bond.
- The effectiveness of Gottman Marital Counseling is questionable, as there are no statistical tests on its impact on marital outcomes.
- Marriage is a complex and difficult relationship to navigate, often with deep-seated problems that can lead to the breakdown of the relationship.
- Different types of marriages require different approaches, and not all marriages are salvageable.

Key questions:
- How do you use Gottman's communication skills work to improve your relationship?
- How can you build and maintain your love maps for your spouse?
- What are some examples of repair attempts you can use during a conflict with your spouse?
- How do couples determine if their conflicts are solvable or unsolvable?
- What solutions does Gottman propose for unsolvable conflicts?
- Is there evidence of Gottman's marriage counseling methods being successful in independent studies?
- Are there other types of counseling that have performed better than Gottman's approach?
- What are the root causes of marriages becoming horrifying soul-sucking messes, and can they be prevented?
- Can people learn healthy communication and problem-solving skills, or are some marriages just doomed to fail?

# Socratic Grilling
*March 6, 2020*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/03/06/socratic-grilling/

## Summary
Key Ideas:
- Noticing confusion is an important rationalist skill.
- Students asking questions to resolve their confusion should not be shut down.
- It is important to think of questioning as Socratic grilling rather than a status grab.
- It can take many iterations to fully understand a concept.
- Vast inferential distances can make it challenging to understand a concept.

Key Learnings:
- It is important to cultivate the desire for things to make sense in order to become a good thinker.
- Tolerating confusion can be difficult, but it is necessary for learning.
- Good teachers will not get mad at students for asking questions.
- Teachers should assume their students are trying to understand and should respond accordingly.

Key Questions:
- How can educators promote a culture of curiosity and questioning in their classroom?
- How can one differentiate between a genuine attempt to resolve confusion and a status grab?
- How can one signal their own confusion without being seen as arrogant or combative?

# For, Then Against, High-Saturated-Fat Diets
*March 10, 2020*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/03/10/for-then-against-high-saturated-fat-diets/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Americans have become more obese over time, with 25% of men now obese compared to 1% in the 1800s, despite similar diets
- Low-carb, paleo, and intermittent fasting diets may work, but only treat the symptoms, not the underlying problem
- Processed food seems to be the common villain in contributing to obesity
- A new theory suggests that high levels of omega-6 polyunsaturated fats, particularly vegetable oils, are to blame
- Burning saturated fat creates reactive oxygen species which signal satiety, while unsaturated fat does not
- The "croissant diet" recommends a diet high in saturated fat and low in unsaturated fat, particularly polyunsaturated fat, but the results have been mixed
- The author investigates the possible causes of the obesity epidemic in the modern West.
- The author discusses scientific studies related to weight loss and saturated fat consumption.
- The author explores three different theories about the causes of the obesity epidemic: conventional wisdom being right, diet being barely related, and a ratchet effect.

Key learnings:
- Despite modern dietary advice, previous generations maintained low obesity rates while eating diets similar to ours
- Processed food and high levels of polyunsaturated fats, particularly vegetable oils, may be contributing to obesity
- The "croissant diet" may be a solution for some individuals, but the results are inconsistent
- People in the modern West are fatter and less healthy than people in other civilizations.
- Different scientific studies suggest different things about the effects of saturated fats on weight loss.
- There are three possible explanations for the obesity epidemic: people are eating more and exercising less, something other than diet is causing it, or it's a ratchet effect where unhealthy eating habits cause permanent weight gain.

Key questions:
- What part of processing makes food bad, and what counts as "processed" or "not processed"?
- Is there a biologically plausible reason why polyunsaturated fat would cause obesity?
- Why do studies on saturated vs. unsaturated fats have limited agreement, despite the "croissant diet" theory suggesting a strong protective effect against weight gain?
- How can we reconcile the evidence from scientific studies with the fact that people used to be thinner and healthier?
- Why haven't fad diets discovered a consistent way to lose weight and keep it off?
- Is the obesity epidemic caused by something other than diet, such as plastics or antibiotics?

- Political wrangling and media presence are significant aspects of presidential leadership.

# Coronalinks 3/19/20
*March 19, 2020*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/03/19/coronalinks-3-19-20/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- There is likely a higher number of real cases of COVID-19 compared to official cases in the US, ranging from 5-20x depending on the estimate.
- The UK's initial strategy of building herd immunity has now been deemed unworkable, and experts are suggesting implementing alternating periods of higher and lower quarantine levels until a vaccine is available.
- There is a shortage of ventilators and oxygen concentrators, and the US government is being urged to request that ventilator manufacturers increase production.
- Disease seasonality is a fascinating field, and while a recent study suggests COVID-19 may be seasonal, there are continuing epidemics in tropical countries.
- Better data is needed to calculate mortality rates accurately.
- The Bay Area has instituted a shelter-in-place order, and businesses and insurance companies have shown flexibility in adapting to the situation.
- Some companies are not being responsible during the coronavirus epidemic, such as Triplebyte firing employees without warning and GameStop requiring employees to bring their own sanitary wipes.
- There is anti-coronavirus propaganda in China, with banners warning against visiting friends and relatives.
- The guidance against wearing masks may have been more of a Noble Lie to prevent hoarding than good science.
- There are different responses to the coronavirus, such as California shutting down large gatherings except at Disneyland and France holding a Smurf cosplay event to alleviate gloom.
- The FDA and CDC tried to thwart the Seattle study which discovered the coronavirus had been circulating there uncaught for weeks.

Key learnings:
- The number of real cases of COVID-19 is likely much higher than official numbers.
- Alternating periods of higher and lower quarantine levels may be a long-term strategy.
- There is a shortage of necessary medical equipment, including ventilators and oxygen concentrators.
- Some companies are not taking proper precautions during the epidemic and are endangering their employees.
- Propaganda warning against visiting friends and relatives is spreading in China.
- The guidance against wearing masks was more to prevent hoarding than to prevent the spread of the virus.
- Responses to the epidemic vary by country and can be polarizing.
- The FDA and CDC seem to be slowing the progress of controlling the virus.

Key questions:
- What can be done to increase the availability of ventilators and oxygen concentrators?
- How can countries best adapt their strategies to the changing situation with COVID-19?
- Will COVID-19 follow typical disease seasonality patterns, or is it too early to tell?
- How can companies be held responsible for not taking proper precautions during the epidemic?
- How effective is the anti-coronavirus propaganda in China?
- Will the guidance against wearing masks change as the situation develops?
- Is there a way to have a more unified response to the epidemic across countries?
- What can be done to ensure the FDA and CDC are not slowing down progress in controlling the virus?

# Face Masks: Much More Than You Wanted To Know
*March 23, 2020*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/03/23/face-masks-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- There's controversy over the use of face masks for protection against coronavirus.
- Both sides agree that N95 respirators help prevent the wearer from getting infected and surgical masks help sick people from infecting others.
- They disagree on whether surgical masks alone help prevent the wearer from becoming infected.
- Epidemiologists have realized that droplet and airborne transmission exist along more of a spectrum, called "aerosol transmission".
- Surgical masks offer no protection against airborne disease or the airborne component of aerosol diseases.
- Randomized studies are unethical during a pandemic, so case-control studies have been used to determine whether masks helped.
- Some studies show that surgical masks, but not respirators, prevent infection.
- There is evidence that masks have efficacy in the community setting, subject to compliance and early use.
- Hokey lab studies show that surgical masks have a lower failure rate than N95 respirators.
- Surgical masks can reduce exposure to infectious influenza virus by an average of 6-fold.
- N95 respirators provide no significant benefit over surgical masks for healthcare workers in most situations.
- Fit-testing is a laborious and necessary task for the effective functioning of N95 respirators, but is problematic for healthcare organizations.

Key learnings:
- Surgical masks offer only limited protection against coronavirus, which is partially airborne.
- Studies on the efficacy of masks are limited due to ethical constraints.
- Per-protocol analyses of trials suggest that surgical masks are helpful in preventing infection, but intention-to-treat analysis shows mixed results.
- Health care workers may have more practice using masks, but community randomized controlled trials suggest that masks work in the community setting.
- Masked health care workers, family members, and travelers on planes are less likely to catch disease than unmasked ones.
- Modest reductions in particle number from wearing a mask in high-risk situations are still helpful.
- Wearing a mask in low-risk situations like being at home or taking a walk may make you marginally less likely to get infected.

Key questions:
- What are the theoretical reasons why surgical masks might or might not work?
- Are people who wear surgical masks less likely to get infected during epidemics?
- Do surgical masks underperform respirators in randomized trials?
- Do surgical masks prevent ordinary people from getting infected outside the healthcare setting?
- How do surgical masks and respirators compare in hokey lab studies?
- How does the particle number map to infection risk when it comes to surgical masks and N95 respirators?
- Is a poorly-fitted N95 respirator better than nothing?
- Why does the CDC recommend against mask use despite evidence suggesting masks are effective?

# Legal Systems Very Different From Ours, Because I Just Made Them Up
*March 30, 2020*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/03/30/legal-systems-very-different-from-ours-because-i-just-made-them-up/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Clamzorians believe in animism and assign legal personhood to objects and natural phenomena, allowing people to sue them for damages.
- Pohjankaupunki punishes crimes with government-mandated prescription of rimonabant, a prodepressant medication which saps the ability to feel happiness.
- Sloviria punishes society instead of criminals by penalizing everyone close to the offender on a social graph.
- Nova-Nishistan's legal system is based on blackmail, where victims can ask for damages in exchange for not reporting crimes to the authorities.
- The people of Bogolia mandated that both sides in a legal case must have equally-priced counsel.
- Mirakoth's legal system is based on fluid ability to transcend systematicity and assigns punishment through a council of judges based on whether something was deemed bad.
- A system of 7 randomly assigned judges determines the outcome of cases.
- A larger council of 49 judges operates as the appeals court for cases.
- Judges are not bound to any philosophy or precedent.
- Frivolous cases can be penalized by the judges.

Key learnings:
- Legal systems can vary greatly from society to society, with unique approaches to punishment and compensation.
- Punishing society instead of individuals can result in social alienation and lack of rehabilitation for offenders.
- The use of fluid ability to transcend systematicity can lead to a lack of structure and clarity in the legal system.
- The judge system is based on impartiality and randomness to prevent bias in court.
- Making sure a case has popular support makes it more likely to win.

Key questions:
- In Clamzoria, what determines the amount of debt owed by the object or natural phenomenon being sued?
- How does the use of prodepressant medication affect the mental health of those who take it?
- What are the potential consequences of punishing society instead of individuals for crimes?
- How does the use of blackmail affect power dynamics within a society?
- How does the mandate for equally-priced counsel affect the quality of legal representation in a given case?
- What are some potential downsides of using fluid ability to transcend systematicity in the legal system?
- How effective is this system in dealing with cases that remain controversial?
- How does this system of judges compare to other court systems around the world?
- Can this system be applied to different areas of law outside of civil law?

# SSC Journal Club: MacIntyre On Cloth Masks
*March 31, 2020*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/03/31/ssc-journal-club-macintyre-on-cloth-masks/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Surgical masks used in hospitals are made of non-woven fabrics that are different from cloth masks.
- Cloth masks block 60 – 80% of virus particles in laboratory tests, while respirators and real surgical masks block 95%+.
- An Australian team conducted a randomized controlled trial on hospital workers in Vietnam comparing the efficacy of surgical masks, cloth masks, and no masks.
- The study found that surgical masks were the most effective in preventing infection, cloth masks were the least effective, and the control group was in the middle.
- The authors lean towards the hypothesis that cloth masks are actively bad since they only examined incoming pathogens, which means there are still reasons to think they are helpful for blocking outgoing ones.

Key learnings
- Cloth masks might be helpful in blocking virus particles, but surgical masks are much more effective.
- The only randomized controlled trial on cloth face masks shows that they are probably net harmful, but the study only examines incoming pathogens.
- Cloth masks can be helpful in blocking outgoing virus particles, but until we can get real surgical masks, cloth masks are better than nothing.
 
Key questions asked by the author (Scott)
- Should people stay away from cloth masks? 
- What should we do since the only RCT of cloth masks shows they are probably net harmful?
- What is the potential risk of using cloth masks for health care workers?

# Book Review: The Precipice
*April 1, 2020*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/04/01/book-review-the-precipice/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Toby Ord's book, The Precipice, warns of existential risks that could completely destroy humanity or ruin its potential.
- Ord argues that we should take these risks very seriously and prioritize protecting the long-term future of humanity.
- The book analyzes specific risks, such as nuclear war and global warming.
- The book "The Precipice" by Toby Ord identifies five risks that could lead to human extinction or failure to realize potential.
- The risks are from natural catastrophes, environmental disasters, pandemics, AI, and miscellaneous factors such as dystopias or unpreparedness for disasters.
- Ord believes that most of these risks are unlikely to lead to human extinction but cautions that humanity is significantly underprepared to mitigate them.
- Different populations should follow different courses of action to mitigate these risks.
- The Precipice is a book that explores existential risks facing humanity.
- One of these risks is the possibility of human extinction caused by a natural or human-made disaster.
- The author, Scott, uses a risk assessment framework to explore this risk.
- He argues that the risk of human extinction may be higher than people generally believe.
- The book's main message is that humanity needs to invest in reducing these risks.

Key learnings:
- The potential future of the human race is vast, with quintillions of humans possibly inhabiting the galaxy.
- The main source of existential risk comes from technological risks, such as nuclear war and global warming.
- Empirical-based methods with justified assumptions should be used to estimate these risks.
- Many of the risks to humanity's future lie in the realm of technology.
- A lot of these risks are potentially preventable with more investment and action.
- There is a significant disparity between the underfunded efforts to prevent existential risks and the potential consequences of not doing so.
- People should concentrate on causes that affect existential risk directly, but ordinary jobs can still help by donating to charities or contributing to efforts that stabilize and strengthen societies.
- There are many possible ways that human extinction could happen, including pandemics, asteroid impacts, climate change, nuclear war, and artificial intelligence.
- The likelihood of these events happening is difficult to estimate, but the consequences could be catastrophic.
- The most effective way to reduce these risks is to invest in research and development of new technologies and policies.
- It is important to develop an "existential risk mindset" that acknowledges the severity of these risks and the need to prioritize them.

Key questions:
- How can society prioritize protecting the long-term future of humanity over more immediate concerns?
- How can we better prepare for and prevent existential risks such as nuclear war and global warming?
- What other technological risks should society be concerned about?
- What are the specific actions governments and organizations can take to mitigate the risk of human extinction?
- How can we better prepare for risks that are unlike anything that has happened before?
- What are the implications of not addressing existential risks?
- How can we balance the need for action against these risks with other pressing issues that require our attention?
- How can we effectively communicate the severity of existential risks to the public and policymakers?
- What ethical considerations are involved in deciding how to allocate resources to reduce these risks?
- How can we balance the need to reduce existential risks with other pressing global issues, such as poverty and environmental degradation?
- What role do individuals, governments, and institutions have in reducing existential risks?

# SSCJC: Real World Depression Measurement
*April 6, 2020*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/04/06/sscjc-real-world-depression-measurement/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- PANDA (Prescribing ANtiDepressants Appropriately) is the largest non-pharma antidepressant trial ever conducted and is designed to mimic “the real world”.
- Measuring real-world efficacy is especially important for antidepressant research because past studies have failed to match up with common sense.
- The study used patient-reported “uncertainty…about the possible benefit of an antidepressant” to select participants.
- The study showed only small to low-medium effect sizes for everything.
- The study’s finding of a 0.4 – 0.5 effect size on patient response closely matches another study’s finding of an 0.4 – 0.5 effect size on depressed mood.

Key learnings:
- It is really hard to measure antidepressant outcomes and all endpoints conflict with each other.
- Antidepressants do better on patient report than on depression tests.
- Patients care a lot less about smaller symptoms and more about feeling happy again.
- Targeted treatment with more typical vs. atypical depression could bring the effect size up.

Key questions:
- Can we really trust clinical trials that fail to match up with common sense?
- How can we measure antidepressant outcomes more accurately?
- Are our depression tests effective? How can we improve them?
- How can we prescribe antidepressants more confidently?

# Never Tell Me The Odds (Ratio)
*April 7, 2020*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/04/07/never-tell-me-the-odds-ratio/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Odds ratios can be misleading in terms of the actual effect size of a treatment or intervention.
- Chen's How Big is a Big Odds Ratio? Interpreting the Magnitudes of Odds Ratios in Epidemiological Studies, offers a way to convert odds ratios into effect sizes.
- A quick heuristic for this conversion is to ignore prevalence and use [ln(odds ratio)]/1.81.

Key learnings
- Odds ratios should not be relied upon to gauge the magnitude of an effect.
- Effect sizes are a better metric for comparing different studies or treatments.
- A heuristic formula can be used to convert odds ratios into effect sizes.

Key questions
- What other measures can be used to accurately gauge the size of an effect?
- Why is there still a reliance on odds ratios in reporting study results?
- How can researchers ensure that their results accurately quantify the effects of a treatment or intervention?

# Coronalinks 4/10: Second Derivative
*April 10, 2020*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/04/10/coronalinks-4-10-second-derivative/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The second derivative of total coronavirus cases has shifted to linear or sublinear growth in most European countries, as well as in the United States and the rest of the world.
- The immune system of bats has a low-grade infection with a bunch of viruses, which occasionally spread to humans.
- There is a possibility of voting entirely by mail for the November election in the US due to the epidemic.
- Turkmenistan and Brazil have denied the existence and seriousness of the virus, leading to potential harm.
- Top economists unanimously support lockdown as a preventive measure.
- The US has ramped up testing impressively fast, and the government has converted the Javits Convention Center into a 2,000 patient hospital in ten days.
- The Netherlands, Sweden, and Brazil are volunteering to be the control group for national lockdowns
- An aircraft carrier captain was fired for whistleblowing about how the Navy handled COVID-19
- The New York Times’ cover design is noteworthy
- There is a document called the Playbook For Early Response To High Consequence Emerging Infectious Disease Threats And Biological Incidents that outlines how to handle pandemics
- UK clinical guideline body NICE recommends against using NSAIDs for COVID-19
- Infectious disease experts did not accurately predict the number of COVID-19 cases
- There are two different interpretations of “flatten the curve”
- There is confusion around Elon Musk’s donation of BiPAP machines and not traditional ventilators

Key learnings:
- The containment strategies for the coronavirus are working for now, with a shift from exponential growth to linear/sublinear growth.
- Widespread flagrant unpunished violation of the law (such as denying the existence and seriousness of the virus) makes it challenging for the rest of us to take lockdown seriously enough.
- Top economists unanimously support lockdown as a preventive measure.
- The US has ramped up testing impressively fast, and the government has converted the Javits Convention Center into a 2,000 patient hospital in ten days.
- Different countries are approaching COVID-19 in different ways, which will provide a variety of data to analyze
- Whistleblowers are facing consequences for speaking out about how their organizations are handling COVID-19
- The media has provided contradictory information regarding COVID-19 prevention measures
- Experts are not always accurate in their predictions
- Follow established documents and guidelines to properly address health crises

Key questions:
- What is the best way to prevent the spread of the virus in countries like Turkmenistan and Brazil where leaders have denied its existence and seriousness?
- What are the potential consequences of voting entirely by mail in the November election in the US?
- How can people take lockdown seriously enough when there are widespread violations of the law, such as not wearing masks or denying the existence of the virus?
- What are the implications of a potential second wave of the virus for countries like the US that are currently contained?
- What can be done to protect whistleblowers who speak out about COVID-19 mismanagement?
- How can media outlets provide more accurate information to the public?
- What can be learned from the discrepancies in infectious disease experts’ predictions?
- How can organizations ensure they are properly handling COVID-19 using established guidelines?
- What is the best way to interpret “flatten the curve” to prevent confusion?

# A Failure, But Not Of Prediction
*April 14, 2020*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/04/14/a-failure-but-not-of-prediction/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Vox concludes that the media needs to be better at saying what they don't know
- The media failed to adequately warn about the pandemic and actively mocked those who did
- Predicting the scale of the pandemic in mid-February was difficult
- Making decisions is about more than just having certain beliefs, it's also about how you act on them
- Common sense is not enough for medical interventions, RCTs are necessary
- The media relied on expert opinions and did not ask about percent confidence in their positions
- Generic smart people on Twitter were better at probabilistic reasoning than domain experts in predicting pandemic.
- Zeynep Tufekci, a sociologist and journalist, is good at treating something as important even without enough evidence that it has to be.

# Depression: The Olfactory Perspective
*April 17, 2020*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/04/17/depression-the-olfactory-perspective/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Depressed people have worse sense of smell and people with worse sense of smell are more likely to get depressed.
- Studies show that depressed subjects did marginally (but significantly) worse on the olfactory test than controls.
- Respiratory diseases that impair sense of smell are linked to depression.
- Animal experiments show that removing the olfactory bulbs of rats consistently makes them depressed.

Key learnings:
- Depression is a systemic disorder that can decrease sensory acuity in general.
- Loss of smell is unique in its emotional effects and is pretty emotionally salient.
- SSRIs seem to improve the sense of smell in the long term as part of their general treatment of depression.

Key questions:
- Why would depression reduce olfactory acuity? And why would reduced olfaction cause depression?
- Does any form of decreased sensory acuity cause depression?
- What does this imply about treating depression? Can you treat depression through improving olfactory sensitivity?
- Can exposing depressed people to really strong smells help alleviate depression?

# The Amish Health Care System
*April 20, 2020*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/04/20/the-amish-health-care-system/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- The Amish belief that healthcare insurance companies are evil, and that good Christians must have no traffic with them.
- The Amish healthcare system is based on church aid, with tithes paid to congregations and the money going to "alms" which the bishop distributes to members in need.
- Amish people who need hospital care can use the not-for-profit and voluntary-run health institution called Amish Hospital Aid, which covers catastrophic hospital admissions only.
- The Amish outperform the English on every measured health outcome, with a higher rate of excellent or very good health and lower rates of diabetes, heart attack, and high blood pressure.
- The Amish health care system is much cheaper than the US health care system, with the average Amish person spending between $600 and $1000 per year compared to the average American spending $11,000.
- The Amish keep costs low by bargaining collectively with providers to keep prices low, being honorable customers, using folk medicine or chiropractors, never suing doctors, not making a profit, having no administrative expenses, avoiding risks with their health, and not overspending on health care.
- The Amish have a successful method for obtaining healthcare without government support.
- They have a free market system in which patients pay for care with their own money, which incentivizes cost comparison shopping.
- The Amish comparison shop by leaning on their church community for financial help, making them feel a sense of obligation to spend church money wisely.
- Their system may not work for people with chronic diseases or mental illness.
- The Amish reliance on church alms and Amish Hospital Aid suggests that their care is still more expensive and burdensome for them than past generations' care was for them.

Key learnings:
- The Amish healthcare system is based on community support and is cheaper and more effective than the US health care system.
- Bargaining collectively with providers, being honorable customers, using folk medicine or chiropractors, not suing doctors, and avoiding overspending can help lower health care costs.
- The Amish's ability to obtain healthcare without government support is due to their free market system and reliance on their church community for financial help.
- Healthcare prices started rising around the same time that health insurance became a thing, and they may have been mutually self-reinforcing.

Key questions:
- How can the US health care system be improved to be more like the Amish healthcare system?
- What are the downsides to the Amish healthcare system, and are they worth the benefits?
- Can the Amish healthcare system be replicated in a modern society, or is it only successful because of the specific circumstances of the Amish community?
- How important is each individual factor in the Amish's ability to obtain healthcare without undue financial burden or government support?
- Are there ways to apply the same principles of the Amish healthcare system to English society?
- Why did healthcare prices start rising, and were they mutually self-reinforcing with the spread of health insurance?

# Studies On Slack
*May 12, 2020*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/05/12/studies-on-slack/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Eye evolution on Earth vs. a hypothetical planet with eyeless animals
- Adaptive fitness landscapes and the role of competition in evolution
- The concept of Moloch vs. Slack as opposites and complements
- Group selection and examples of two-layer evolutionary systems
- Slack is important for group selection problems in evolutionary systems.
- Two-layer evolutionary systems can produce their own slack.
- Monopolies have limitless slack and can afford to invest in long-term R&D projects.
- The balance between Guns and Butter decisions in strategy games depends on distance and timing.
- Slack is necessary for organisms to innovate and evolve.
- Group selection can promote a system with both competition and decentralization.
- Memes are in constant evolutionary competition, and inferential range is important for exploring new ideas.

Key learnings:
- Evolutionary pressure can limit the development of complex adaptations like eyes unless there is a balance of competition/pressure and relaxation in evolutionary environments
- The interplay between Moloch (intense competition) and Slack (relaxation of competition) is important in optimizing evolutionary fitness in complex organisms
- Evolutionary solutions that involve shared rulesets and punishment for rulebreakers can mimic successful two-layer evolutionary systems like multicellular life.
- Group selection problems can be solved with two-layer evolutionary systems that allow for some slack.
- Monopolies can be successful in R&D due to their ability to invest in long-term projects.
- The optimal balance between Guns and Butter decisions in strategy games depends on distance and timing.
- A system that promotes an evolutionary system with both competition and slack is usually best.
- Inferential range is important for being open-minded and exploring new ideas.

Key questions:
- How can we apply the concept of adaptive fitness landscapes to real-world evolutionary scenarios?
- What are some examples of successful two-layer evolutionary systems in human society today?
- How can we balance intense competition and slack in human societies to optimize growth and prosperity?
- How can we create two-layer systems to incentivize slack in group selection problems?
- What are the potential downsides of encouraging monopolies for R&D?
- How can we use the lessons from strategy games to inform real-world decision-making?
- How much internal conflict is good for a group to keep them honest?
- What can we learn from different economic systems, and how can we apply them to evolve better businesses?
- How can we balance being open-minded with choosing better ideas over worse ones?

https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/05/18/coronalinks-5-18-20-when-all-you-have-is-a-hammer-everything-starts-looking-like-a-dance/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Stay-at-home orders don't seem to have affected the percent of people staying at home, according to cell phone data.
- Data shows that government policy isn't as much of a factor in controlling the virus as previously thought.
- Speaking and singing loudly can increase the risk of transmission, and churches should be careful about reopening as a result.
- Some people are law-abiding and haven't visited loved ones during the pandemic, and the government should acknowledge them.
- A coronavirus prediction market is now available.
- Metaculus provides a platform for users to make predictions and guesses on various topics related to the coronavirus pandemic
- The author wonders about the potential need for ongoing restrictions if there is never a definitive solution to the pandemic
- There is no consensus on how bad the impact of the pandemic has been compared to other causes of death or suffering
- There is debate over the effectiveness of lockdowns and the possibility of achieving herd immunity through natural infection
- Coronavirus has killed 90,000 Americans so far.
- Comparing seasonal flu deaths to coronavirus deaths is problematic.
- The coronavirus death toll only counts confirmed cases, whereas flu death toll counts estimated cases.
- The number of confirmed flu deaths is only about 10,000 yearly.

Key learnings:
- Most people started staying at home before the official lockdown orders.
- Government policy adds or subtracts a relatively small modifier to the wide variation of factors affecting the spread of the virus.
- Speaking and singing loudly can greatly increase the risk of transmission.
- The government should try to support law-abiding citizens who haven't visited loved ones during the pandemic.
- Metaculus can be a useful tool for making predictions and gathering information about current events
- The author cautions against relying on metaphors or other forms of comparison to understand the impact of the pandemic, as different comparisons can lead to vastly different conclusions
- The author argues that the costs and benefits of different responses to the pandemic are complex and difficult to compare, and that different people may have different views on what policies are most effective or desirable
- The comparison between coronavirus and seasonal flu deaths is not straightforward.
- The number of confirmed coronavirus deaths is likely an underestimate of the actual number of deaths.
- The CDC's reported flu death toll may not be a reliable estimate of actual flu deaths.

Key questions:
- Why are stay-at-home orders poorly enforced and not affecting the percent of people staying at home?
- What factors are affecting the spread of the virus besides government policy?
- Could the missing cultural vulnerability factor be how loud and spittle-filled people's speech is?
- Can the government do more to support the law-abiding citizens who haven't visited loved ones during the pandemic?
- What are the most effective ways to predict or respond to a pandemic like COVID-19?
- How can we balance the need to control the spread of the virus with the economic and social costs of lockdowns and other restrictions?
- What factors determine how different individuals or groups evaluate the impact of the pandemic, and how can we address disagreements or misunderstandings in these evaluations?
- Where are the latest active pools for pooling donations to reach the amount needed for a matching donation?
- How can we accurately compare the death tolls of coronavirus and seasonal flu?
- Should the CDC lower the reported flu death toll to signal that we should worry less about the flu compared to coronavirus?

- The burned house horizon is the area in Europe where people from 7000 BC to 2000 BC often deliberately burned their own houses down for no apparent reason.
- A new meta-analysis out of Stanford shows that Alcoholics Anonymous is the most effective path to abstinence; however, its effectiveness does not necessarily mean it is the right solution for everyone.

# “My Immortal” As Alchemical Allegory
*May 26, 2020*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/05/26/my-immortal-as-alchemical-allegory/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- "My Immortal" is a notoriously bad Harry Potter fanfic that has been the subject of much discussion and analysis.
- The author argues that the fanfic contains symbolism related to alchemy, specifically the stages of nigredo, albedo, and rubedo.
- The fanfic also incorporates themes from Rosicrucian writings and Goethe's Faust II.
- The My Immortal fanfiction contains many elements of alchemy.
- Ebony is in the nigredo stage at the beginning of the story, filled with shame and lacking self-acceptance.
- Draco represents Ebony's Shadow, or inferior being, and Ebony must unite with him at the end of the first stage.
- Ebony skips a step, failing to kill the dragon before uniting with it, which results in a partial consummation and a hostile superego.
- Ebony retraces her steps and slays the dragon, followed by an alchemical wedding with her animus represented by a dual animus figure of Hagrid and Harry "Vampire" Potter.
- Ebony tries to integrate her animus but ultimately fails, slipping back into the nigredo stage.
- The second part of My Immortal mirrors Part II of Goethe's Faust.
- The alchemical process of uniting Rose and Cross leads to the final alchemical wedding.
- The ending of My Immortal suggests Ebony has redeemed herself and completed the Great Work.
- My Immortal transcends the source material by demonstrating Ebony's redemption.

Key learnings:
- The alchemical stages of nigredo, albedo, and rubedo are symbolic of a process of spiritual transformation and discovery of the true Self.
- The Rosicrucians were a secret brotherhood of alchemists who were popular in the 17th century and whose symbolism was centered around the rose cross.
- Goethe's Faust II is a complex work with mysterious alchemical undertones.
- The My Immortal fanfiction provides a unique interpretation of alchemical symbolism in fiction.
- The alchemical process involves multiple stages, including nigredo, albedo, and rubedo, and each stage embodies specific colors and symbols.
- Skipping a step in the alchemical process can lead to incomplete transformation and repeated cycles.
- Integration with the anima or animus involves recognizing and accepting all aspects of the self.
- My Immortal provides a blueprint for escaping the narrative created by the ego and breaking into reality.
- Every one of us is capable of completing the alchemical Work.

Key questions:
- Who was the author of "My Immortal" and why did they choose to incorporate these complex themes and symbols in their fanfic?
- Are there other works of fanfic or popular culture that contain hidden alchemical or symbolic meanings?
- How can an understanding of alchemy and its symbols enrich our understanding and analysis of literature and pop culture?
- How does Ebony finally reach the rubedo stage?
- How do the dual animus figures of Hagrid and Harry "Vampire" Potter represent different aspects of the animus?
- What is the significance of Dumbledore as the albedo figure in the story?
- How do the colors and symbolism of Ebony's clothing reflect her progress in the alchemical process?
- What is the significance of the mispelling of "Helena" in Chapter 38 of My Immortal?
- Why does Ebony's date with Satan confusedly combine the second and third alchemical weddings?
- What is the meaning of the final word "ABRA KEDABRA!!!!!!!!!!!11111" in My Immortal's final chapter?

# Bush Did North Dakota
*May 28, 2020*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/05/28/bush-did-north-dakota/

## Summary
Key ideas
- 46% of Trump voters endorsed the Pizzagate conspiracy theory, but this isn't unique to them
- A 2016 survey found that 33% of respondents endorsed a conspiracy theory about a nonexistent event
- Polls that don't offer a "don't know" option force people to choose agreement or disagreement, and some will agree just because
- There may be a "North Dakota Constant" of 33% for how many people will believe a conspiracy theory without reason
- High-information voters who believe conspiracy theories are not discussed here

Key learnings
- Polls that don't offer a "don't know" option can skew results towards agreement
- Conspiracy theorists may start with a high prior on any given conspiracy being true
- There may be a significant portion of the population that will believe a conspiracy theory without reason

Key questions
- Why do some people stick to their prior and not change their beliefs even after getting more information?
- Can we really conclude anything from specific statements about what percentage of a group believes a certain conspiracy theory?
- Why is there a "North Dakota Constant" of 33% for people who will believe a conspiracy theory without reason?

# Creationism, Unchallenged
*May 28, 2020*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/05/28/creationism-unchallenged/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Responsible news organizations are faced with the challenge of reporting on stupid things without giving them too much publicity.
- Studies have shown that the mainstream press has played a role in the dissemination of fake news.
- There is a concern that being too aggressive in covering and debunking fake news might actually give it more attention.
- The author draws a parallel between the coverage of creationism in the early 2000s and the coverage of modern-day fringe ideologies.

Key learnings
- Covering stupid things can result in wasted time and resources and take away from reporting on more important issues.
- Legitimizing unethical practices to combat fringe ideologies may not be effective in the long run.

Key questions
- How can responsible news organizations strike a balance between reporting on stupid things and not giving them too much attention?
- Should mainstream news outlets tone down their coverage of fringe ideologies to avoid signal-boosting them? 
- Is it worth using controversial tactics if it helps to combat anti-science ideologies, or is it just as useless as excessive media coverage of stupid things?

# Book Review: Origin Of Consciousness In The Breakdown Of The Bicameral Mind
*June 1, 2020*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/06/01/book-review-origin-of-consciousness-in-the-breakdown-of-the-bicameral-mind/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Julian Jaynes' book, The Origin Of Consciousness In The Breakdown Of The Bicameral Mind, has flaws in the way it explains the origin of consciousness and posits the breakdown of the bicameral mind.
- Theory-of-mind is our intuitive model of how the mind works, and is something that has to be learned from parents and from our surroundings.
- Jaynes believes that theory of mind only first appeared in the Bronze Age Near East, c. 1500 - 750 BC, and that the Iliad illustrates the development process of theory-of-mind.
- The Bronze Age societies had a hive-mind mentality where people tried to capture their deities in their heads to replace their free will with their mental model of society's demands on them.
- People in the Bronze Age believed in Demons, and the air in Mesopotamia was darkened with them.
- The writings during the 1000-750 BC period include the main themes of "the gods have forsaken us" and "why aren't there gods anymore?".
- Jaynes believes that as the theory-of-mind waterline rises, fewer and fewer people hear the voices of the gods.
- Julian Jaynes' theory of consciousness states that subjective consciousness is an invention of the Bronze Age Near East
- Jaynes argues that prior to the Bronze Age, humans were bicameral, meaning that one hemisphere of the brain controlled the other and hallucinations of gods were common
- The theory of consciousness is not widely accepted and has several criticisms including the fact that split-brain patients do not replicate Jaynes' theory and that Jaynes' theory does not account for cultures isolated from the Near East during the Bronze Age

Key learnings:
- Children learn theory-of-mind from their parents, and it is not an inherent concept.
- The Bronze Age Near East and the Iliad illustrate a gradual process of refinement in understanding theory-of-mind.
- The ancients lacked theory of mind, had no mental imagery, and viewed the gods as internal voices who gave them commands.
- Giving yourself multiple personalities is easy under the right circumstances.
- The Bronze Age societies tried to capture their deities in their heads to replace their free will with their mental model of society's demands on them.
- People were obsessed with demons post-1000 BC as the gods receded, and the voices of the gods faded when theory of mind started spreading.
- By 500 BC, the ability to hear the gods was limited to a few prophets, oracles and poets.
- The removal of gods from the internal world of people paved the way for many other things, including the invention of idea heaven.
- Jaynes' theory of consciousness proposes that subjective consciousness is an invention
- The theory is highly controversial and has several criticisms
- Culture plays a significant role in the formation of theory of mind and can impact behavior in unique and surprising ways

Key questions:
- When in human history did theory-of-mind first arise, and how did it come about?
- What is the evidence to support Jaynes' argument that theory-of-mind only appeared in the Bronze Age Near East?
- How did ancient people view the gods as internal voices, and how did this affect their decision-making processes?
- What was the real cause of the collapse of the Bronze Age?
- How did the decline in the ability to hear the gods affect society?
- If consciousness is an invention, what does that mean for our understanding of the mind?
- Is theory of mind culturally determined?
- How do we account for cultures isolated from the Near East who did not have subjective consciousness according to Jaynes' theory?

Key learnings
- The business argument for paywalls is not true in all cases.
- Clickbait articles are designed to create new desires in readers and are not necessarily informative.
- Paywalls create a smaller and less diverse discussion section.
- There are steps that we can take to improve access to information.

Key questions
- Why do paywalled newspapers use a clickbait model?
- How can we prevent the clickbait model from ruling the internet?

# The Obligatory GPT-3 Post
*June 10, 2020*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/06/10/the-obligatory-gpt-3-post/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- GPT-3 is the successor to GPT-2 and is much bigger, but not revolutionary.
- The model can produce text that is more coherent and structured than GPT-2's.
- GPT-3's math performance has improved dramatically from GPT-2's.
- The scaling laws in neural networks are being investigated by GPT-3 to see how increasing model size affects performance.
- The scaling curves for GPT-like AI will continue to improve rapidly.
- Smarter GPTs will do better at various language benchmarks and could potentially do more radical things like write proofs or generate scientific advances.
- Even the largest GPTs are still not great at logical reasoning and basic math.
- It's unlikely that GPTs based on text prediction alone will take over the world.

Key learnings:
- Although GPT-3 is impressive, it is not superintelligent and is task-specific.
- GPT-3's success suggests that increasing model size improves performance, but it is unclear where the scaling breaks down.
- There are potential risks associated with further increasing AI model size.
- The author is interested in seeing what a GPT with a sufficient number of parameters can do.
- There is a possibility that GPTs could become superintelligent if they are designed to do more than text prediction.
- The adult human brain has a hundred trillion parameters, which could be matched by a GPT in the near future.

Key questions:
- Does the fact that GPT-3 is not a superintelligence mean that fears of AI taking over the world are unfounded?
- Will increasing model size indefinitely lead to ever-improving AI performance or are there limits to how much scaling can improve performance?
- What are the potential risks associated with further increasing AI model size and how can they be addressed?
- How much more powerful will GPT-like things become in the future?
- Can GPTs based on text prediction alone ever produce superintelligent output?
- How do humans create things smarter and better than those we grew up with?
- What are the limits to what a GPT with a sufficient number of parameters can do?

# Wordy Wernicke’s
*June 11, 2020*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/06/11/wordy-wernickes/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Language involves two major brain areas: Wernicke’s area for meaning and Broca’s area for structure and flow.
- Damage to Wernicke’s area results in meaningless speech, while damage to Broca’s area results in speech that lacks structure but remains meaningful.
- GPT-3's language output is on a higher level than the Broca’s/Wernicke’s dichotomy.

Key learnings
- The way we use and interpret language is heavily reliant on specific brain areas functioning correctly.
- The brain's language system can be disrupted in different ways, leading to different kinds of speech impairments.

Key questions
- What computational considerations caused the split between Broca’s area and Wernicke’s area in the brain?
- Is there any microstructural difference in the areas that reflects this split?

# The Vision Of Vilazodone And Vortioxetine
*June 15, 2020*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/06/15/the-vision-of-vilazodone-and-vortioxetine/

## Summary
Key ideas:
- Vortioxetine and vilazodone are two antidepressants developed through extensive research, but they are no better than earlier medications.
- SSRIs increase serotonin immediately but take about a month to work because of presynaptic 5-HT1A autoreceptors that adjust serotonin levels.
- Some scientists wondered if blocking these autoreceptors would create faster and better antidepressants, leading to studies on pindolol and buspirone as adjunctive therapy.
- Vilazodone is an SSRI and 5-HT1A partial agonist that does not appear to work any better than other antidepressants, and it is more expensive.
- Vortioxetine is an SSRI and 5-HT1A agonist/5-HT3 antagonist that does not appear to live up to its theoretical promise.
- Pharma companies spent a decade researching 5-HT1A partial agonists for depression, but it did not lead to any benefits.
- A new drug, vortioxetine, is an SSRI with a faster mechanism of action and additional anti-anxiety, anti-nausea, and cognitive-improving effects compared to other antidepressants, but its effects are not very significant.
- Vortioxetine is more expensive than other antidepressants, costing $375 a month.

Key learnings:
- Drug discovery in psychiatry is often inefficient and accidental, and designing antidepressants is challenging due to the complexity of the pathways involved.
- The mechanism underlying the delayed onset of action of SSRIs involves negative feedback from presynaptic 5-HT1A autoreceptors, which can be bypassed by blocking or desensitizing these autoreceptors.
- The potential benefits of adding 5-HT1A partial agonists like buspirone or vilazodone to SSRIs are uncertain, and vilazodone is much more expensive than other SSRIs.
- The advantages of a single medication that combines 5-HT1A and 5-HT3 activity are speculative, and vortioxetine does not appear to provide significant clinical benefits.
- Vortioxetine may treat depression about as well as any other antidepressant.
- The drug may cause more nausea and vomiting than other antidepressants.
- Studies suggest that vortioxetine may have slight (but not statistically significant) sexual benefits and may improve performance on a specific cognitive test.
- Combining 5-HT1A partial agonism with SSRIs did not lead to any benefits for depression.

Key questions:
- Why do some patients get an antidepressant response from SSRIs immediately, despite the 5-HT1A autoreceptors?
- How does buspirone act as an anxiolytic and a pro-sexual agent, and why are the explanations for this mechanism so unclear?
- Why did people assume that buspirone and vilazodone would work similarly to adjunctive pindolol, despite their different pharmacological profiles?
- What is the significance of 5-HT3 antagonism in antidepressant therapy, and does it provide any clinical benefits beyond reducing nausea?
- Are there any medications that combine the potential advantages of 5-HT1A and 5-HT3 activity in a single molecule, and would they provide significant clinical benefits for depression and anxiety?
- Is vortioxetine worth the cost, given its minimal benefits?
- Do 5-HT1A partial agonists work for depression, and why did pharma companies spend so much money researching them?
- What is the mechanism of action of buspirone and how does it relate to serotonin?

# Slightly Skew Systems Of Government
*June 17, 2020*
https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/06/17/slightly-skew-systems-of-government/

## Summary
Key ideas
- Clamzoria is an acausal democracy where elections happen after the President's term.
- Clamzoria chooses officials through a prediction market to protect against demagoguery.
- Cognito is a constitutional mobocracy where the Executive Branch is a president, and the legislature is the mob.
- Yyphrostikoth is a meta-republic that aims to create a system of checks and balances by having twelve members representing various governments.

Key learnings
- Democracies have flaws, and different forms of government can have unique advantages.
- There is merit in predicting election outcomes and encouraging politicians to run on unpopular but good policy ideas.
- Protests can be peaceful and effective, and they can influence decision-making in politics.
- A meta-republic can promote checks and balances, but can have particular challenges that require creative solutions.

Key questions
- What are some other novel forms of government that can address the limitations of current systems?
- How can we ensure that protests are genuine expressions of citizens' opinions, and not the result of paid incentives?
- Can a constitutional mobocracy influence national issues that are not necessarily favored by the majority?
- What are the implications of having a Representative For Theocracy that is chosen randomly by lottery?
