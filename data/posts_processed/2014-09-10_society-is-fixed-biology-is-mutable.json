    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- There is a stereotype that the Left believes in social determinism and the Right believes in biological determinism, but the author rejects this premise.\n- Society is difficult to change, but biology is more easily changeable.\n- Biological explanations should not be ignored in favor of social solutions.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Some problems, such as drug abuse and obesity, may have biological explanations that can be addressed more directly than social solutions.\n- Multivitamin supplementation and later school start times may be effective interventions for certain problems.\n- Genetic explanations are not as scary as they seem, and implantable contraception could be an effective solution.\n\nKey questions:\n- Is it possible that there are problems that have both biological and social explanations that need to be addressed simultaneously?\n- How can we shift our focus to incorporate biological explanations without completely ignoring social solutions?\n- What other interventions could be implemented at the biological level to target social problems?"
