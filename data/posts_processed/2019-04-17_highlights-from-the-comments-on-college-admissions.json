    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Donors and board members use national rankings, which include low admission rates, as a measure of how well a school is doing.\n- Consulting firms often only consider applicants from certain elite schools.\n- The rise of the Common App might incentivize schools to get as many applicants as possible.\n- College selectivity is significant even after controlling for student quality as measured by SAT scores.\n- The issue of college admissions affects a small subset of institutions.\n- The college admissions process has become increasingly competitive over time, with more students applying to top schools and investing more effort into preparing for admissions criteria.\n- The rise of college rankings has contributed to the pressure to succeed in college admissions.\n- The lack of transparency in the financial aid process creates incentives for students to apply to more schools to increase their chances of receiving a good offer.\n- The increase in Advanced Placement exams shows that competition for college admissions is getting tougher.\n\nKey learnings:\n- The competitiveness of the college admissions process is driven by various factors, including rankings and prestigious job opportunities.\n- Financial considerations, such as the cost of attendance and financial aid packages, can significantly impact the college selection process.\n- The number of students competing for admissions has increased over time, and the expectations for applicants have risen accordingly.\n- College rankings and financial aid policies have contributed to the intensifying competition.\n- The rise of the internet and other technology has made it easier for students to prepare for the admissions process but has also raised the bar for success.\n\nKey questions:\n- How can the college admissions process be improved to reduce stress and improve outcomes for students?\n- How can we address the impact of financial considerations on college selection and admissions?\n- Are there alternative ways to measure the success of colleges and universities that do not incentivize low admission rates?\n- How can we create a fairer and more transparent admissions process that doesn't rely so heavily on rankings?\n- Is there a way to make the financial aid process more predictable and fair to help students make informed decisions about where to apply?\n- What impact does the intensifying competition have on students who don't make it into the most prestigious colleges and universities?\n"
