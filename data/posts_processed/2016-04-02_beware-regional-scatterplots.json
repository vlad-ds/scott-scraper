    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Scatterplots are commonly used to visualize relationships between variables in different regions.\n- Confounding variables, such as income and race, can affect the interpretation of scatterplots.\n- In some cases, the apparent correlation between variables may be a coincidence.\n- Clustering can also affect the interpretation of scatterplots, as groups may show different correlations than the overall dataset.\n\nKey learnings\n- Control for confounding variables when interpreting scatterplots.\n- Look for patterns in clustering to identify potential confounding factors.\n- Be cautious when drawing causal conclusions from scatterplots.\n\nKey questions\n- What are the potential confounding variables in a given scatterplot?\n- Are there any clusters of data that are driving the apparent correlation?\n- How might different groupings affect the interpretation of the scatterplot?"
