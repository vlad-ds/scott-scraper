    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Meditation is a training method for the mind that helps to override the default path of least resistance.\n- The practice of meditation involves recognizing and dropping thoughts that distract from focusing on the breath.\n- Over time, meditation leads to the development of a skill that can be used outside of meditation practice.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Meditation is not meant to be easy, as the goal is to train the mind to take the opposite of the path of least resistance.\n- Continued practice of recognizing and dropping distracting thoughts can lead to more efficient and quicker recognition of such thoughts.\n- Meditation can improve the subjective temporal granularity of an individual, allowing for greater intervention in the construction of thoughts.\n\nKey questions:\n- Who or what is doing the overriding of the process in meditation?\n- How does the development of a skill through meditation relate to flexing one's muscles after doing many push-ups?\n- What is the relationship between vibrations in meditation and subjective temporal granularity?"
