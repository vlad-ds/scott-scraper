    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Clozapine is an antipsychotic drug that is better than most other antipsychotics.\n- It has serious side effects, hence it cannot be given to everyone in need.\n- Recent studies suggest that clozapine might be a combination antipsychotic+NMDAergic.\n- The NMDAergic effect may be responsible for the drug's unique efficacy.\n- However, there is still no clear evidence that NMDA agonists work for schizophrenia at all.\n\nKey learnings\n- Clozapine is a unique antipsychotic drug because of its efficacy.\n- Since it has severe side effects, psychiatrists can't prescribe it to everyone in need.\n- Recent studies suggest that clozapine might have a direct effect on glycine agonism.\n\nKey questions \n- Why is clozapine so uniquely great?\n- Can a version of clozapine be made without its side effects?\n- Are NMDA agonists effective at treating schizophrenia?"
