    "summary": "Key ideas\n- There is a distinction between collective intelligences and genuine superintelligence.\n- Teams, corporations, and cultures have a lot of advantages over individuals, but they cannot simulate aspects of intelligence regarding creative problem-solving ability.\n\nKey learnings\n- A team of people smart enough to solve problems up to Level N may be able to work in parallel to solve many more Level N problems in a given amount of time, but it won\u2019t be able to solve Level N+1 problems.\n- Even if all of the problems were magically solved of teams, corporations, and cultures, it still leaves the fundamental problem where no organization of chimpanzees will ever write a novel.\n\nKey questions\n- Why do people think corporations, bureaucracies, teams, civilizations, and mind-mapping software are superintelligent AIs?\n- What is the distinction between collective intelligences and genuine superintelligence?\n- How do collective intelligences compare to an individual's intelligence in terms of creative problem-solving ability?"
