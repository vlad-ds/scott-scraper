    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Danese et al challenge the assumption that the severe stress of being abused decreases brain function\n- Danese et al looked at big developmental studies that had followed thousands of children from birth and found that abused children had lower IQ than unabused children before adjustments\n- After adjustments, there was no difference between IQs in the two groups\n- The study raises the possibility that kids from poorer families were more likely to get abused and to have lower IQs\n\nKey learnings\n- The role of shared environment is less important than previously believed\n- Evidence shows that child abuse doesn't increase the risk of ADHD, autism, learning disorders, and conduct problems; it mostly doesn't explain personality disorders\n- Childhood sexual abuse is linked to a threefold lifetime increase in psychiatric disorders\n\nKey questions\n- Did the Danese et al study understate the dangers of abuse, as it may only catch differences between not-abused-at-all kids and only-mildly-abused kids?\n- How does childhood sexual abuse affect likelihood of being sexually abused?"
