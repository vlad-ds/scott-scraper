    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- In online debates, people often use negative affect to associate ideas with negativity and evoke a disgust reaction.\n- Projective identification can cause groups to become the very thing they are accused of being.\n- Negative affect can push groups past an event horizon where their reputations are destroyed forever.\n- Negative affect builds up over time and can make a group seem toxic, pushing away establishment members and leaving only extremist members.\n- The safest debate partners are those who have already been dismissed by everyone else, and have no power to load negative affect onto others.\n\nKey learnings:\n- In online debates, it is important not to let other people load negative affect onto groups.\n- There is a right to be vulnerable to attack, which is a necessary precondition for interesting discussion and the exchange of ideas.\n- Calling out bad arguments and making insults and mistruths reputationally costly can prevent groups from becoming toxic.\n\nKey questions:\n- What can be done to prevent projective identification?\n- Can groups ever recover their reputation once they pass the event horizon?\n- What are some strategies for combating negative affect in online debates?"
