    "summary": "Key ideas\n- A study shows that the Amish people fall lower than members of many other groups in terms of life satisfaction.\n- The Amish numbers vary depending on the study cited, and the results are not replicable.\n- The results suggest that there's no clear traditional vs. modern society dichotomy.\n\nKey learnings\n- Modern people tend to report average happiness higher than their happiness with any individual part of their lives.\n- Traditional societies are more likely to value humility and treat pride as a sin.\n\nKey questions\n- Are the least-developed areas today like sub-Saharan Africa places that have absorbed the worst parts of modernity, but not the good parts like not-dying-of-cholera?\n- Is there really a gulf between Pennsylvania Amish and Illinois Amish as vast as that between Swedes and Calcutta slum-dwellers?\n- Is there really an entire scientific field where everyone is named \"Diener\"?"
