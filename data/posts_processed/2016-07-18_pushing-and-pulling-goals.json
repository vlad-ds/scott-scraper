    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Distinguishing between \"pulling\" and \"pushing\" goals.\n- Pushing goals involve having a plan or structure and trying to figure out what to do with it.\n- Examples of pushing goals include biology research projects, starting a club, and writing on a specific topic.\n- Pushing goals may be dishonest and may indicate something has gone wrong in the planning process.\n- Things done for pushing goals usually suck.\n\nKey learnings:\n- It is preferable to have \"pulling\" goals, which involve setting out to achieve something and coming up with a plan and structure to do so.\n- When pursuing a pushing goal, it is helpful to consider why the goal was initiated in the first place.\n\nKey questions:\n- What is the difference between a pulling and pushing goal?\n- Why do pushing goals suck, and when are they necessary?\n- How can one come up with ideas for writing or research without relying on pushing goals?"
