    "summary": "Key ideas\n- North Korea\u2019s official Twitter account only follows one active user, a twenty-something Texan investor, and he has no idea why\n- Giving people better health insurance didn\u2019t necessarily make them healthier, as shown by the RAND insurance experiment and the more recent Oregon experiment\n- Female journalist disguised herself as a man and went undercover to study sex roles, concluding that men are suffering\n- The Man Who Called Gandhi A Sissy \u2013 pretty interesting Economist article on Vinayak Savarkar, the founder of modern Hindu nationalism\n- Japan\u2019s Sexual Apathy Is Endangering The Global Economy\n\nKey learnings\n- Often, the results of an experiment support whatever the commentator involved originally believed\n- The academic system works by having each field focus on one view and then opposing views branch off by pretending to be different fields\n- The failures of conventional nutrition science had killed millions of people\n- Brown adipose tissue, a form of fat that burns energy, is probably the closest equivalent to the popular notion of \u201csome people just have high metabolism and won\u2019t get fat no matter how bad their diet is\u201d\n- Mirabegron, an FDA-approved drug, may be a promising treatment for metabolic disease\n\nKey questions\n- How do we know the gender gap in economics is not primarily due to sexism?\n- Are there any men who tried what female journalist Norah Vincent did, which is to disguise themselves as a member of the opposite sex?"
