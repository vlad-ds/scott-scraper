    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Survey data suggests that both extreme rightists and extreme leftists are more likely than moderates to have been diagnosed with most conditions.\n- Leftists might be more likely to trust the psychiatric system and get diagnosed.\n- Leftists might be more likely to think of their issues through a psychiatric lens than rightists.\n- The SSC survey is unrepresentative, making it a bad sample to use for these analyses.\n- There is no reason to rely on SSC survey results when there are larger, more rigorous surveys available.\n\nKey learnings:\n- When discussing and analyzing survey data, it is important to properly cite sources and attribute analysis to the correct party.\n- The SSC survey may be flawed and unrepresentative, so it is important to be cautious when drawing conclusions from it.\n\nKey questions:\n- How can we accurately compare survey data from different sources and ensure that we are drawing accurate conclusions?\n- What steps can we take to improve the representation and accuracy of survey data?"
