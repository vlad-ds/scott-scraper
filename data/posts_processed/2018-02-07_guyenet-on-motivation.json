    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- The motivational system in the lamprey is structured through the basal ganglia and the pallium.\n- Competition between incompatible option generators defines how strong a bid each region of the lamprey's pallium puts in to the striatum.\n- The striatum selects the strongest bid and fulfills the key properties of a selector.\n- Humans have to make up their minds about many things, unlike a lamprey, but the human motivation system works similarly.\n- Parkinson's disease and abulia show the crucial importance of the basal ganglia in decision-making processes.\n\nKey learnings:\n- The basal ganglia plays a very important role in our decision-making processes and in fulfilling the key properties of a selector.\n- Dopamine levels and the sensitivity of the basal ganglia influence the motivation of engaging in any behavior, especially high-willpower-requirement behaviors.\n- Confidence levels in new evidence are an important variable to consider when the striatum has to make the final decision on which behavior to execute.\n\nKey questions:\n- How does the dopamine system prioritize high-effort behaviors over low-effort behaviors?\n- What are the different factors that increase or decrease the dopamine levels in humans?\n- How can we better understand the motivational system and use it to improve our decision-making processes?"
