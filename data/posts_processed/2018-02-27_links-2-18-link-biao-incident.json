    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Punding is an uncommon side effect of drug abuse that involves performing repetitive, mechanical tasks.\n- Montana has made its own rule demanding neutrality from providers receiving state contracts after the US repealed net neutrality provisions.\n- Tibetan monks are more afraid of death than any other group studied.\n- Trump's tariffs on solar panels have implications for renewable energy.\n- Google Lunar X Prize has announced that everyone loses.\n- NSA removes \"honesty\" and \"openness\" from its list of core values.\n- Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tories' answer to Jeremy Corbyn, is a colorful and likeable character, but not very competent.\n- MIT is launching a new masters program in economics that doesn't require a degree.\n- The tallest mountain in the solar system is Rheasilvia.\n- Amazon enters the health care sector.\n- List of substances administered to Adolf Hitler: he was on a cocktail of methamphetamine, cocaine, adrenaline, testosterone, strychnine, heroin, oxycodone, morphine, barbiturates, and human fecal bacteria.\n- A new meta-analysis suggests that there's no evidence mindfulness works for anything.\n- The naming convention for Trojan asteroids.\n- The use of realistic details doesn't necessarily make a work more realistic.\n- Various scholars have created conlangs meant to resemble extinct languages.\n- The California state government is considering a bill that could end the housing crisis.\n- China is cracking down on funeral strippers.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Addiction to dopaminergic drugs may cause punding, which is an obsession with repetitive mechanical tasks.\n- Not many people are aware of punding, and some may continue their behavior even when they have reason to stop.\n- Montana has passed its own net neutrality rule for providers who receive state contracts.\n- Tibetian monks fear death more than any other group.\n- Trump's tariffs on solar panels could affect renewable energy.\n- Fuel-driven rockets could be replaced by electric-driven rockets.\n- There is no outstanding winner for the Lunar X Prize.\n- NSA removed core values of honesty and openness.\n- Jacob Rees-Mogg is a character unlikely to lead effectively.\n- Trinity College in Connecticut is the first US college to break the $70,000/year price point.\n- The correlation between SAT score and college GPA is higher than reported.\n- There are challenges to open borders in the form of poverty and wealth differences.\n- MIT is offering a new masters program that does not require a degree.\n- Hitler was on a cocktail of drugs, and it's unclear which one caused his erratic behavior.\n- Mindfulness does not necessarily have any benefits.\n- There are specific naming guidelines for Trojan asteroids.\n- Realism is a complex and multifaceted concept.\n- Conlangs can be used to preserve and honor extinct languages.\n- Housing policy is a contentious issue with potential unintended consequences.\n- Funeral strippers are a controversial and taboo practice in China.\n\nKey questions:\n- What other weird side effects exist for other types of drug use?\n- How will Montana enforce their rule on providers who do not agree to net neutrality provisions?\n- Why are Tibetan monks more scared of death than any other group?\n- What was the point of Trump's tariffs on solar panels, and how will the tariffs affect the renewable energy industry?\n- What is preventing innovators from developing electronic-based rockets on a large scale?\n- What now happens with the end of the Lunar X Prize competition?\n- What are the implications of NSA removing \"honesty\" and \"openness\" from its list of core values?\n- What are the consequences of Jacob Rees-Mogg becoming Prime Minister?\n- Why does Trinity College cost so much, and will more institutions follow suit?\n- Does the correlation between SAT and college GPA suggest that society has become more credentialist?\n- What factors beyond poverty and wealth might affect the open borders issue?\n- Will other universities create programs without requiring HS or college degrees?\n- What other factors contributed to Hitler's erratic behavior?\n- What is the future of research and funding for mindfulness practices?\n- Why is there a specific naming convention for Trojan asteroids?\n- How common are stories about groups of people believing their language to be perfect or descended from a particular figure?\n- What are the potential drawbacks of mandating strong pro-development policies in urban areas?\n- Why has China only recently decided to crack down on funeral strippers?\n"
