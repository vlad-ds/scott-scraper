    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Utilitarianism becomes unintuitive and scary when making a decision that affects a domain unrelated to the decision maker.\n- The developing world is similar to a bottomless pit that we expect to be there and are happy to help, but nursing homes and prisons are often ignored.\n- Nursing homes and prisons are problems that are expensive to solve with no clear visible gain, and may require resources from other important causes.\n\nKey learnings\n- Utilitarianism can be difficult to apply in situations that involve making sacrifices for domains that individuals may not perceive as part of their \"normal world.\"\n- While some issues, such as suffering in the developing world, are acknowledged and regularly addressed, other problems, like abuse in nursing homes and violence in prisons, are often ignored despite being equally important.\n\nKey questions\n- How can utilitarianism be applied in situations that require making sacrifices to help other domains unrelated to the decision-maker's experience?\n- Why do we acknowledge some problems, such as suffering in the developing world, while ignoring others, such as abuse in nursing homes and violence in prisons?\n- What can be done to address problems like abuse in nursing homes and violence in prisons, which are expensive to solve and have no clear visible gain?"
