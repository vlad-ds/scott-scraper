    "summary": "Key ideas: \n- A cascade of increasing respectability contributed to the success of the gay rights movement. \n- In contrast, when 0% respectable people take up a cause, it can doom it forever via a disrespectability cascade. \n- The author considers how these opposite theories apply to current political and social issues, including the fight to protect scientific integrity.\n\nKey learnings:\n- The visibility and likeability of a group or issue might impact the success of a respectability cascade.\n- The initial taboo level of a cause might also impact its susceptibility to a disrespectability cascade.\n- There are divergent opinions on whether suppressing or elevating the voices of 0% respectable people is the best strategy.\n\nKey questions:\n- What heuristics can we rely on to predict when one approach to a respectability cascade is more likely than the other?\n- Should people in positions of power, such as Jonathan Haidt, tell random disrespectable anti-SJW Twitter trolls to shut up or to shout louder?\n- How can we balance the need for respectability with the need for grassroots movements and advocacy?"
