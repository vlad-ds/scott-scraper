    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- People are more cautious when thinking probabilistically.\n- Survey of 2,350 people estimating probability of Kavanaugh guilt in sexual assault case.\n- Average probability is 52.64%, but there's a partisan and gender skew in responses.\n- People with high knowledge of Kavanaugh more likely to lean innocent.\n- No real consensus on how plausible an accusation has to be before it means someone should be denied nomination.\n- In a hypothetical universe where Kavanaugh immediately admitted and apologized for his actions, 55% of people would accept him.\n\nKey learnings:\n- People are able to admit to a little bit of uncertainty in their answers when using probabilities.\n- However, partisan biases and strong differences in opinions remain.\n- There is no consensus on this issue in the general demographic and even unbiased people as a group cannot send a coherent signal.\n\nKey questions:\n- Does encouraging people to think probabilistically actually affect the accuracy of their answers?\n- How can partisan biases be removed from surveys on controversial topics?\n- What other factors should be considered in looking at a nominee's background beyond sexual assault allegations?"
