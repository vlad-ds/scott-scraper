    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- PETA creates attention through controversial publicity stunts, but at the cost of its credibility\n- Highly publicized rape cases that turn out to be false can harm the credibility of the larger movement to believe victims\n- People use moral decisions to signal how moral they are, even if that means supporting disastrous decisions based on obscure moral principles\n- The more controversial a case, the more attention it garners, even if there are other cases that are equally deserving of attention\n- Controversial campaigns often backfire by polarizing people and creating opposition\n- Bloggers tend to write more about controversial topics as they generate more page views compared to uncontroversial ones\n- The structures of different online communities can facilitate the spread of outrage-inducing memes, leading to the proliferation of specific and often polarizing views\n- Any complex multi-person system acts according to its own chaotic incentives that don\u2019t necessarily correspond to what any individual within the system wants.\n- Emergent uncoordinated process can lead to the rise and prominence of some topics while others are relegated.\n- There is a need for coordination to address issues such as racist police brutality.\n- Moloch, the abstracted spirit of discoordination and flailing response to incentives will publicize whatever he wants.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Attention and credibility can be at odds with each other, and attention through controversy can come at a high cost\n- Signal value can sometimes be a poor basis for moral decision-making\n- Publicizing controversial cases can be harmful to victim advocacy if those cases turn out to be false\n- Activists should be cautious in choosing their battles and try to pick settled cases that are unlikely to polarize people excessively\n- Bloggers should be aware of the tradeoff between page views and social responsibility and strive to balance both\n- The design of online communities can have a profound impact on the spread of ideas and memes, particularly if outrage is a common currency\n- The media has a responsibility for covering issues that affect society.\n- Charitable acts do not sell.\n- Moloch is the enemy of press freedom and unity.\n- Memetic evolution creates a machine optimized to search the world for the most controversial and counterproductive issues, then make sure no one can talk about anything else.\n\nKey questions:\n- How can advocacy movements balance the need for attention with the need for credibility?\n- How can people distinguish between signal value and actual moral principles when making decisions?\n- How can the media responsibly cover controversial cases without causing harm to advocacy movements or victim credibility?\n- How can we strike a balance between writing about things that matter and things that generate page views?\n- Can online communities be designed in a way that promotes civility and fosters constructive dialogues?\n- How can social media platforms prevent the spread of toxic and polarizing memes?\n- How can society address issues such as racist police brutality?\n- What is the role of the media in the promotion of societal issues?\n- Can charities be sold in the media?\n- Why is Moloch against unity?\n"
