    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Predictions for the 2016 US election from sources like New York Times and 538 vary.\n- There are many factors that can affect the outcome of the election, such as unforeseen events or unpredictable public opinion shifts.\n- The author suggests that rather than attributing victory to grand narratives like nationalism, people should acknowledge that political fundamentals and noise make either party's victory feasible.\n\nKey learnings\n- The results of the 2016 US election were unpredictable, meaning the outcome is not always representative of grand narratives or societal trends.\n- No prediction can account for every factor that may influence an election outcome.\n\nKey questions \n- How much should we rely on predictions for a given election?\n- Should we attribute election outcomes to broader societal trends or recognize them as the result of individual factors?\n- How do unpredictable factors impact the outcome of elections?"
