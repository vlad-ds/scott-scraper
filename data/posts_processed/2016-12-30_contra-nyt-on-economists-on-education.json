    "summary": "Key ideas\n- The New York Times article claimed that economists generally do not support a free market for education.\n- The article cited a Chicago panel of leading economists who disagreed with implementing a voucher system for education.\n- Economists are trained to recognize market failures and the need for government intervention when necessary.\n\nKey learnings\n- Only 36% of economists surveyed agreed that implementing a voucher system would improve education.\n- A majority of economists who have an opinion are pro-voucher, compared to only 19% who disagree.\n- The NYT article falsely implies that there is an economic consensus against implementing a voucher system for education.\n\nKey questions\n- What other academic fields might have different perspectives on implementing a voucher system for education?\n- How might a voucher system for education impact different socioeconomic classes?\n- What alternative solutions might economists suggest for improving the education system?"
