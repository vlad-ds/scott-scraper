    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- The author discusses issues with the current health insurance system beyond the usual criticisms of compassion and efficiency.\n- The author provides examples of patients and friends who have experienced problems with insurance, despite being well-off and intelligent.\n- The list of examples shows that the system fails everyone in different ways.\n\nKey learnings:\n- The health insurance system is not working for everyone, not just the poor and uninsured.\n- Other systems, such as Medicare for All and doctor cooperatives, could potentially fix these problems.\n\nKey questions:\n- How can we create a health insurance system that works for everyone, regardless of their income or current insurance plan?\n- What are the costs and benefits of different proposed systems, such as Medicare for All, doctor cooperatives, and a free-market system?\n- How can we ensure that patients receive the care they need, even if they change insurance plans or doctors?"
