    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Imperfect information still provides some insight and is better than zero information\n- Utilitarianism provides nonzero information transfer about the badness of North Korea and other difficult-to-quantify issues\n- Intuitive decision-making often leads to significant errors in judgement\n\nKey learnings\n- Even if numbers are made up, applying arithmetic calculations to them can still provide valuable insight\n- Utilitarianism may not be objectively correct but can provide useful information about difficult-to-quantify issues\n- Made-up models can highlight errors in intuition and provide a second opinion without systematic bias\n\nKey questions (asked by Scott)\n- Why do I find the utility weights interesting even though they are not objectively correct?\n- How can we quantify things we do not know how to quantify?\n- Can making up numbers and applying calculations be more accurate than intuitive decision-making in some cases?"
