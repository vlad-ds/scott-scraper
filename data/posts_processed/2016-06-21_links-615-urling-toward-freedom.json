    "summary": "Key Ideas:\n- England has a high rate of tornadoes per unit area in the world.\n- A study from Sweden examines the effect of education on IQ and finds that an extra year of education increases permanent IQ by 0.75 points.\n- Larry Page has a flying car startup, and a second competing startup just to motivate the first one.\n- Reddit moderators censored discussion of the Orlando shooting and never mentioned that Reddit actually censored any information that the shooter was Middle Eastern or motivated by Islamic terrorism.\n- Handguns account for about 20x more deaths than all rifles, assault or otherwise.\n\nKey Learnings:\n- An extra year of education increases permanent IQ by 0.75 points.\n- Obesity surgery is worth it and lowers mortality rates by about 70%.\n\nKey Questions:\n- Why do some schools produce a disproportionate share of math competition winners?\n- How g-loaded is the increase in IQ in the Swedish education study?\n- Should the threshold for who gets obesity surgery be lowered based on the study's data?"
