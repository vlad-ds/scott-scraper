    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Upasaka Culadasa, a Buddhist teacher accused of cheating on his wife with prostitutes, wrote a meditation guide called The Mind Illuminated.\n- Many other self-proclaimed enlightened Buddhist teachers have also been involved in sex scandals.\n- While some modern teachers say enlightenment makes you free from desire, cheating on one's spouse shows evidence of craving and desire.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Achieving enlightenment doesn't necessarily equate to being morally perfect.\n- Dissolving social conditioning through meditation can result in the \"Inner Light of Compassion\" being AWOL when faced with temptation.\n- The transformative practices that give a higher level of consciousness have failure modes that potentially help us understand the benefits of samsara.\n\nKey questions:\n- What can accusations of infidelity of self-proclaimed enlightened people teach us about enlightenment?\n- Can we maintain any reason to believe in enlightenment as an achievable state at all given the prevalence of sex scandals among Buddhist teachers? \n- Are there benefits to samsara that explain why our system protects its usual state so diligently?"
