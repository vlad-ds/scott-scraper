    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- The Method of Levels, based on perceptual control theory, is presented as the perfect solution to all psychological problems.\n- MoL sees intrapsychic conflict as competing control systems and suggests activating the natural reorganizing process of the brain through awareness to solve these conflicts.\n- MoL is somewhat similar to psychodynamic therapy, but with more concrete suggestions.\n- How to Read Lacan by Slavoj Zizek is a readable, but not very coherent interpretation of Lacanianism.\n- The Steerswoman is a popular, but relatively apolitical, 80s fantasy series featuring a rationalist organization of steerswomen seeking knowledge.\n\nKey learnings:\n- MoL might have some useful insights for treating psychological conflict, but its claims of being a one-size-fits-all solution are problematic.\n- Awareness and discussion of conflicts with a therapist can lead to reorganization of higher-level control systems in MoL, which can solve intrapsychic conflict.\n- Zizek's book might not be the best starting point for understanding Lacanianism.\n- The Steerswoman is a fun, bare-boned fantasy series that is relatively apolitical.\n\nKey questions:\n- Can MoL really solve every psychological problem?\n- How well does MoL's theoretical backing hold up?\n- What exactly is Lacanianism, and is Zizek's book a good introduction to it?\n- How effective would a real-life organization of steerswomen be in answering any question asked of them?"
