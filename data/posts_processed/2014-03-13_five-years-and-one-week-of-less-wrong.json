    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Less Wrong turned five years old, prompting the author to reflect on how the community has progressed in that time.\n- Scott proposes that as new ways of thinking replace old ones, people forget the old ways existed or were coherent.\n- The author reflects on personal progress in understanding concepts such as probabilistic beliefs, decision theory, non-goal-directed behavior, and efficient charity.\n- The community has made progress in areas such as understanding scientific biases, developing social norms for polyamory, and exploring new ways of interacting with people.\n\nKey learnings:\n- The author has progressed in understanding certain concepts, but there are still others that are inscrutable to them, suggesting that intellectual progress follows a clear path.\n- The community has made significant progress in understanding scientific biases, and developing new and better ways of interacting with people.\n\nKey questions:\n- How do individuals progress along the path of intellectual change?\n- What are the most significant areas of progress made by the Less Wrong community in the past five years?\n- What areas of knowledge and understanding are still inscrutable to individuals in the Less Wrong community?"
