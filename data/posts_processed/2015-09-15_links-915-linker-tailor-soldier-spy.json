    "summary": "Key ideas\n- A recent meta-analysis challenges the notion of willpower as a limited resource.\n- Evidence of bias in Olympics judging found in winners of subjective contests from previous years.\n- The genetics of intelligence are not fully understood, but preliminary research suggests selection pressure affects all genes equally.\n- Street dogs in Moscow have adapted to their urban environment, including learning the subway train system and avoiding competition for food.\n- Harvard University declares it can no longer afford closed access journals and asks its researchers to support open access.\n\nKey learnings\n- Biases can be found in subjective contests like figure skating judging.\n- Preliminary research suggests that selection pressure affects all genes related to intelligence equally.\n- Street dogs in Moscow have found ways to adapt to their urban environment.\n- Harvard's move towards open access journals could be a big boon for the research community.\n\nKey questions\n- Could the prevalence of biases in subjective contests be responsible for the recent increase in murder rates in certain US cities?\n- Could street dogs in Moscow teach us a valuable lesson about how to govern and manage our societies?\n- How will Harvard's move towards open access journals impact the research community as a whole?"
