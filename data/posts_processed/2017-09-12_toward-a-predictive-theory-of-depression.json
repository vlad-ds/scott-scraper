    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- The predictive processing model has been used to explain autism and schizophrenia, but its application to depression is unclear.\n- Depression may be related to pathologically low confidence in neural predictions, affecting multiple aspects of perception and motivation.\n- Depression may be a result of biological processes that lower neural confidence.\n \nKey learnings:\n- Depressed people may experience perceptual abnormalities and psychomotor retardation due to globally low confidence levels in neural predictions.\n- Low confidence in beliefs and actions may create general low self-confidence and feelings of worthlessness.\n- Happiness may be related to increased confidence levels, while sadness may be related to decreased confidence levels.\n \nKey questions:\n- Is there a possible predictive processing angle to depression?\n- How could the relationship between low confidence in neural predictions and depression be explained?\n- Is happiness the derivative of neural confidence?"
