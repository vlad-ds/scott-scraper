    "summary": "Key ideas\n- The author conducted a survey on how people thought about the moral weights of animals.\n- Commenter Tibbar replicated the survey using Mechanical Turk and found different results.\n- The author acknowledges limitations to Tibbar's findings, including the sample demographics and potential lack of moral theory.\n\nKey learnings\n- Using Mechanical Turk may not be a reliable way to replicate a survey, as the sample may differ significantly from the original survey's population.\n- It is important to consider the limitations and potential biases of any survey results.\n\nKey questions\n- How can survey methods be improved to better replicate population demographics and minimize potential biases?\n- How do different moral theories affect individual beliefs about animal rights?"
