    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Coming up with entirely novel ideas is really hard, and people often get inspired by dreams or drugs.\n- Mishearing other people, misunderstood positions, and metaphors can inspire new ideas that break out of ruts in thinking.\n- Humans have negative creativity and their brains are designed to stay in rut-like patterns of thinking.\n- An AI with zero creativity might be better than humans who have negative creativity and resort to crutches like metaphors and dreams to inspire new ideas.\n\nKey learnings\n- Adding a certain amount of noise to a problem might be a way of inspiring new ideas.\n- There could be multiple independent modules, and a general factor of skill common to all of them.\n- Creativity may be a relatively tractable problem for AIs.\n\nKey questions\n- How can we further encourage novel ideas outside of typical patterns of thinking?\n- How can we build AIs that are creative and able to think outside of well-worn cognitive pathways?\n- What other strategies can we use to escape conceptual ruts and foster positive creativity?"
