    "summary": "Key Ideas:\n- People often misinterpret the results of studies.\n- David Spiegelhalter, a Risk Professor from the University of Cambridge, argues that 'one extra case of bowel cancer in 100 lifetime bacon-eaters' is a better way to convey risk than using relative risk.\n- Mortality rates, despite being very important, are much more complicated and result in very tiny differences that barely affect the underlying distribution. \n\nKey Learnings:\n- Absolute risk should be used instead of relative risk to provide a better understanding of how worried you should be.\n- A serving of meat costs an average of one minute of life, which is tiny compared to how much time is spent cooking and preparing it.\n- Very few people die when they're young, so large changes in mortality barely affect the underlying distribution.\n\nKey Questions:\n- Can we quantify risk better when it comes to eating meat?\n- How do you measure mortality rates? \n- Should people sacrifice an hour to have a bacon sandwich?"
