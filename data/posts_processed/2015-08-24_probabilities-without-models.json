    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Some argue that probability shouldn\u2019t be used without a well-defined model\n- The above argument does not hold up in situations where important decisions have to be made without a model\n- In real-life, even without a model, decision-makers make probability judgments\n- Choosing not to make a choice is also a choice with consequences\n\nKey learnings\n- Probability judgments without models are necessary in real-life situations\n- Refusing to make probability judgments could lead to consequences just the same as making a choice\n- Frame choices in terms of probability to check for overconfidence when making decisions\n\nKey questions\n- How can we make probability judgments without a model?\n- When should we take risks on low probability outcomes?\n- How accurate are probability judgments when made without a model?"
