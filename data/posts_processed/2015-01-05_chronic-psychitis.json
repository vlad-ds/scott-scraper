    "summary": "Key ideas\n\n- Inflammation caused by cytokines released by immune cells is linked to \"sickness behavior,\" which resembles depression-like symptoms.\n- Good diet, exercise, and sleep reduce inflammation and improve depression.\n- Cortisol, released by the hypothalamopituitaryadrenocortical axis, downregulates the immune system and decreases inflammatory cytokine action.\n- Anti-inflammatory drugs like aspirin and celecoxib show promise in treating depression, but more research is needed.\n- Theories of how depression starts, whether from inflammation or other causes, are still widely sought.\n\nKey learnings\n\n- Depression and inflammation are closely related.\n- There is evidence that inflammation caused by illness triggers depression.\n- Anti-inflammatory drugs can improve depression, but they pose some health risks.\n\nKey questions\n\n- Can antidepressants work by reducing inflammation, and is the serotonin theory a red herring?\n- What links depression to diseases like cancer, rheumatoid arthritis or diabetes, and to chemicals called cytokines?\n- Can depression be treated by giving people anti-inflammatory drugs, and what potential risks or side effects might this present?"
