    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Bayes\u2019 Theorem is a mathematical framework for integrating new evidence with prior beliefs\n- The brain performs top-down processing which involves letting its models of the world influence perceptions\n- Perception is a \u201chandshake\u201d between top-down and bottom-up processing\n- Organic psychosis, like schizophrenia, might involve disruptions in sensory processing\n- Autism is a form of aberrant precision where confidence intervals are too low causing an inability to \u201csmooth over\u201d bottom-up information\n- Autistic people have sensory gating problems that lead to difficulty regulating sensory input.\n- Autistic people dislike social interaction because it is unpredictable.\n- Autistic people engage in stimming behaviors as an attempt to control their sensory environment.\n- Autistic people might benefit from weighted blankets due to the predictability of sensory input.\n\nKey learnings:\n- The neurotransmitters in the brain might represent different terms in Bayes\u2019 Theorem\n- Top-down models predict what we\u2019re going to see, bottom-up models perceive the real world, then they meet in the middle and compare notes to calculate a prediction error\n- Schizophrenics and people stoned on marijuana are more likely to properly identify the face as concave than everyone else\n- LSD bottoms out in the pattern of increased AMPA and increased NMDA that we would expect to produce hallucinations\n- Autism is a form of aberrant precision where confidence intervals are too low causing an inability to \u201csmooth over\u201d bottom-up information\n- Autistic people struggle with sensory gating, and this can affect their perception of the world around them.\n- Autistic people have difficulty with social interaction because it is hard to extract meaningful information from unpredictable sensory input.\n- Stimming behaviors can be seen as an attempt to control the sensory environment.\n- Weighted blankets might be helpful to autistic people because they provide a high degree of predictable sensory input.\n\nKey questions:\n- What is the relationship between top-down processing and bottom-up processing?\n- How do disruptions in sensory processing lead to organic psychosis?\n- Why do increasing levels of dopamine lead to narrowed confidence intervals and increased certainty?\n- How does sensory deprivation impact sensory processing and resulting perceptions?\n- What is the relative role of NMDA and AMPA in producing hallucinations and delusions?\n- If psychosis is a case of attenuated priors, why do delusions become so fixed in psychotic individuals?\n- What is the difference between mild surprise and annoyance-based prediction errors and belief in delusions of reference?\n"
