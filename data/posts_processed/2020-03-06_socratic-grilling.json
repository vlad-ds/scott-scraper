    "summary": "Key Ideas:\n- Noticing confusion is an important rationalist skill.\n- Students asking questions to resolve their confusion should not be shut down.\n- It is important to think of questioning as Socratic grilling rather than a status grab.\n- It can take many iterations to fully understand a concept.\n- Vast inferential distances can make it challenging to understand a concept.\n\nKey Learnings:\n- It is important to cultivate the desire for things to make sense in order to become a good thinker.\n- Tolerating confusion can be difficult, but it is necessary for learning.\n- Good teachers will not get mad at students for asking questions.\n- Teachers should assume their students are trying to understand and should respond accordingly.\n\nKey Questions:\n- How can educators promote a culture of curiosity and questioning in their classroom?\n- How can one differentiate between a genuine attempt to resolve confusion and a status grab?\n- How can one signal their own confusion without being seen as arrogant or combative?"
