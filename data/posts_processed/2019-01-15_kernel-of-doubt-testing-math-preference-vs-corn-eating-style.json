    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Mathematicians can be divided into those who prefer analysis and those who prefer algebra.\n- Ben Tilly wrote a blog post in which he claimed that analysts ate corn in rows and algebraists ate corn in spirals.\n- The author conducted a survey to test Tilly's claim, but found no significant difference between mathematicians who preferred algebra and those who preferred analysis in the way they ate corn.\n- The author also analyzed his data by gender, race, ethnicity, subethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, social class, neurotype, and political affiliation, but found no clear patterns in the way different groups ate corn.\n\nKey learnings:\n- The connection between the type of mathematics a person prefers and the way they eat corn is likely not as strong as previously claimed.\n- It is difficult to determine why certain groups of people eat corn in certain ways.\n\nKey questions:\n- Why did Ben Tilly's observation that algebraists eat corn in spirals and analysts eat corn in rows receive so much attention?\n- Are there other examples of seemingly unrelated preferences or behaviors that are connected?\n- Why do some groups of people eat corn in rows while others eat corn in spirals?"
