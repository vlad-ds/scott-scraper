    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Hospitals comprise hundreds of different specialized professions that offer coordinated care to patients\n- The vast majority of people working in hospitals spend their time synchronizing the work of different professions rather than performing medical tasks\n- Hospitals depend heavily on computer systems to coordinate care, which can go wrong if people use them incorrectly\n- Medical residents, like the author, often act as middlemen between nurses and senior doctors, answering simple questions by paging a senior\n- Residency can be both fulfilling and frustrating, involving tasks like entering orders into the computer, begging people to follow through on tasks, and noting small details in medical charts that could make a difference in patients' lives\n\nKey learnings:\n- Hospitals are incredibly complex, with many moving parts that must work together in concert to provide care to patients\n- The hospital's computer system is essential to coordinating care but can also easily break down if people aren't careful\n- A medical resident's job is to navigate the complex bureaucracy of a hospital and help coordinate care for the patients they see\n\nKey questions:\n- How can hospitals better manage the coordination of care across so many different professions?\n- What more can be done to make sure that computer systems don't break down and cause harm to patients?\n- Is there a more efficient way to deal with simple questions that medical residents receive, such as finding a way to eliminate the need to page senior doctors?"
