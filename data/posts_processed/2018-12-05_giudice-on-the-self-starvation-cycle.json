    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Anorexia has a cultural component but also has a biological component.\n- The self-starvation cycle plays a crucial role in the onset of anorexia.\n- The starvation response brings about psychological changes that contribute to the reinforcement of the cycle.\n\nKey learnings\n- Food restriction may be initially prompted by a variety of motives and involuntary weight loss due to physical illness can start the cycle.\n- Increased physical activity is a key component of the starvation response in humans.\n- Pride is a powerful additional reward of self-starvation - achieving extraordinary levels of thinness and self-control makes people feel special and superior.\n\nKey questions\n- How do we reconcile the cultural and biological components of anorexia?\n- How does the \"self-starvation cycle\" operate and contribute to the onset of anorexia?\n- Why do most people who starve not develop anorexia?"
