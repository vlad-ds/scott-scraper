    "summary": "Key ideas\n- The most important study on placebo effect suggests that the placebo effect is clinically insignificant, except for a few isolated conditions such as pain.\n- Regression to the mean may be responsible for the placebo effect.\n- Acupuncture does better than other placebos, even placebo pills.\n- The author believes they have witnessed cases of the placebo effect.\n\nKey learnings\n- Most sick people get better eventually, so regression to the mean may be responsible for the placebo effect.\n- Placebos don't work except for some conditions such as pain.\n- Acupuncture may have optimized to be an effective pain-relieving placebo.\n\nKey questions\n- Why did people start calling everything placebo effect when there was no way to tell without further study how much was real placebo effect and how much was just regression to the mean?\n- Why do some acupuncture trials show that acupuncture works even though some experiments have found that sham acupuncture works equally well?\n- What about depression? Does the placebo effect work on it, especially on a temporary basis?"
