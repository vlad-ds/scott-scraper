    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Psychoanalysts propose that sons are attracted to women that resemble their mothers as they use them as a schema for their ideal woman.\n- Research has shown that sexual selection is based on learned imprinting, at least in animals whose names start with \"zebra fi\".\n- Studies \u200balso suggest human mate preferences are driven by sexual imprinting across diverse traits of race, age, and lactation status.\n- Previous twin studies were unable to prove a genetic or family environmental influence on mate choice.\n- Mate choice is still a curious and disquieting conclusion as there is no proof\u200b of a genetic or family environmental influence in humans.\n\nKey learnings:\n- There is a lot of evidence suggesting that animals learn mate preference via imprinting.\n- Humans may choose mates based on some form of imprinting process resembling the roles played by their opposite-sex parent.\n- True love and romantic infatuation may be driving forces behind choosing a mate.\n\nKey questions:\n- Do sons really get attracted to women who look like their mother, or is it a genetic influence?\n- How much impact do early childhood experiences with parents have on a person's mate preference?\n- How does sexual imprinting apply to other fetishes like adult baby fetishes?\n- Are family environmental and genetic factors the only driving forces behind mate preference?"
