    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- A study has found that women who identify as feminist have masculinized finger ratios, leading to a possible explanation for the \"feminist paradox\".\n- Hal Finney, a Bitcoin pioneer, has passed away from ALS and been cryonically frozen.\n- A compound found in some algae can cause an individual to feel like cold things are hot and hot things are cold.\n- The alternative arithmetic Presburger arithmetic is being considered for use in math, due to its provable consistency and completeness.\n- The CEO of McDonald's is a roboticist who originally thought he was going to an interview with McDonnell-Douglas.\n\nKey learnings:\n- SAMe, a sorta-natural supplement, is reportedly as effective or better than traditional antidepressants.\n- Growing up poor or in a bad neighborhood has been found to not significantly increase the likelihood of committing crimes as an adult.\n- Vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent serious diseases, and anti-vaccination arguments can be easily debunked.\n- The Ivy League college admissions process perpetuates advantages for the wealthy, and standardized tests should be used more to level the playing field.\n\nKey questions:\n- Do feminists actually have masculinized finger ratios, or are there other factors at play?\n- What implications does the cryonic freezing of Hal Finney have for the future of life extension?\n- Can the algal toxin causing the sensation of hot/cold inversion be used as a party trick?\n- What other alternative math systems are being considered and for what purposes?\n- How can standardized tests be made more accessible to lower income individuals to ensure fairness in college admissions?"
