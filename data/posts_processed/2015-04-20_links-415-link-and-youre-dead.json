    "summary": "Key Ideas:\n- Perytons may not be a novel astronomical object, but microwave ovens in astronomers' break room.\n- Diseases such as sarcoidosis without causative organisms could potentially be caused by an unknown disease.\n- CVS will allow people to obtain naloxone without prescriptions to fight opioid overdose.\n- A surgeon in Italy is set to attempt the world's first head transplant.\n- A study argues that women are more deontological than men while men are slightly more utilitarian than women.\n- FBI admits to fudging forensic hair matches in nearly all criminal trials for decades.\n\nKey Learnings:\n- Polling on climate change and global warming is surprising.\n- The ability to give away prescription drugs without prescriptions exists legally.\n- Probiotic treatments could decrease reactivity to sad mood and decrease depression risk.\n- Cognitive behavioral therapy can reduce crime, drugs, and violence in at-risk poor young men.\n\nKey Questions:\n- How did surveyors calculate the geographical center of the United States in 1919?\n- Can Raj Chetty's theories on location-dependent social mobility be flawed?\n- Why is individual differences in executive function almost entirely genetic when other cognitive skills are 50% genetic?\n- Has Obamacare turned voters against sharing the wealth?"
