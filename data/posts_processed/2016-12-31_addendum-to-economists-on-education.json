    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- The article fails to make it clear that economists are, in fact, in favor of school vouchers.\n- Changing the headline of the article could produce exactly the opposite impression in readers' minds.\n- The majority of economists are not convinced that school vouchers are a bad idea.\n- Uncertainty in the results of the survey can be interpreted in different ways, leading to different conclusions.\n- The article does not accurately represent the opinion of economists on school vouchers.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Interpreting data to draw biased conclusions can be misleading.\n- Uncertainty in survey results can lead to misinterpretation.\n- The wording of a survey question can have a significant impact on the results.\n\nKey questions:\n- What is the best way to present survey results without being misleading?\n- How can we ensure that survey questions are worded in a non-biased way?\n- What impact does uncertainty in survey results have on their interpretation and usefulness?"
