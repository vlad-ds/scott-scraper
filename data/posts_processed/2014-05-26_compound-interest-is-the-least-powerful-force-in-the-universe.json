    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- This blog post discusses the ideas proposed in a Vox article by Ezra Klein and a related essay by Ta-Nehisi Coates about compound interest and reparations.\n- Coates argues that white America built its wealth through racism and plunder, and allowed compound interest to work its magic.\n- Klein argues that modern-day whites benefit from the lingering effects of slavery through compound interest.\n- The author questions the validity of these arguments and explores the possibility that ill-gotten wealth may not persist through generations.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Wealth lasts a long time, according to studies by economist Gregory Clark.\n- Efforts to democratize education and eliminate discrimination over the past century have had no discernible effect on mobility.\n- There is no clear evidence that wealth persists through multiple generations.\n \nKey questions:\n- How much do modern-day whites benefit from the lingering effects of slavery, and how much do modern blacks suffer?\n- Why haven't the descendants of slave-owning societies become richer?\n- How much of intergenerational correlation in outcomes is driven by fundamental, family-specific effects (the family\u2019s cultural and genetic infrastructure)?"
