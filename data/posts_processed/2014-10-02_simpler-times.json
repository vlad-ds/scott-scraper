    "summary": "Key ideas\n- The blog post mentions various songs that schoolchildren used to sing, which glorify violence against teachers, principals, and the school itself.\n- The author questions why these songs exist and if they still exist today.\n- The author also discusses how these songs were popular among children but never led to actual school shootings.\n\nKey learnings\n- The author presents an argument against the notion that exposure to violence causes individuals to commit violent acts.\n- The blog post raises questions about the effects of cultural norms and the influence of social science on our understanding of societal behavior.\n\nKey questions\n- Why do songs depicting violence against teachers and schools exist, and what purpose do they serve?\n- Is it fair to assume that exposure to violent media or language has a direct causal relationship with violent behavior?\n- How have societal norms around expressing violent behavior changed over time, and what impact have these changes had?"
