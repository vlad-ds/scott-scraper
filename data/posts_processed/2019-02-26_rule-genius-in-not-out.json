    "summary": "Key ideas\n- A black box that generates scientific hypotheses with a failure rate would be highly valuable.\n- Genius involves coming up with outrageous ideas, pursuing them despite critics and failing sometimes.\n- Hypersensitivity to patterns can lead to both exceptional genius and exceptionally egregious mistakes.\n- Geniuses are similar to black boxes with a certain failure rate, and their failures can be easily discarded.\n- Positive selection should be practiced for geniuses, where one good call rules them in instead of negative selection where one bad call rules them out.\n\nKey learnings\n- A genuinely original idea is rare, and someone who comes up with a single good original idea is a better use of time than someone who reliably never gets anything too wrong.\n- Respecting someone in the idea industry is not a relevant predicate, as they are a black box who occasionally spits out ideas to evaluate.\n- Intellectual exploration is a different job than promoting the right opinions about things.\n\nKey questions\n- What if the black box had only a 10% or 1% success rate?\n- Are some of the examples of geniuses with terrible ideas unforgivably bad?\n- What are the different strategies required for intellectual exploration and promoting the right opinions about things?\n- What is the difference between moral outrage culture and intellectual outrage culture?"
