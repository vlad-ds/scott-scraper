    "summary": "Key ideas\n- The author addresses the claim that modern society causes international instability, leading to increased war and mayhem.\n- The claim is that war was rare in the old aristocratic era compared to today because states were fully sovereign, self-interested, and run by noble classes.\n- The post provides statistical evidence to show that the world has been getting more peaceful over the past seventy years, and every past era was much more violent than our own.\n- The most plausible Reactionary response would be that this is too small a time horizon: that the horrors of progressivism should be viewed over a timescale of centuries.\n\nKey learnings\n- The world has become more peaceful over the past seventy years.\n- Virtually every past era was much more violent than our own.\n- The more progressive countries both start and participate in fewer wars than the less progressive countries.\n\nKey questions\n- Are wars worse today, or were we worse during the old aristocratic era? By what standards?\n- What is the plausible Reactionary response to the fact that the world has been getting more peaceful over the past seventy years?\n- Why were the deadliest conflicts in human history before the Enlightenment?"
