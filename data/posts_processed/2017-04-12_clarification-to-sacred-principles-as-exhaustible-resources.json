    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- The author clarifies that he is not against defending Jordan Peterson and Charles Murray's free speech rights.\n- The problem lies in inviting the most controversial speaker possible and not in the speakers themselves.\n- The author uses the example of Rosa Parks' case to illustrate the importance of having a likable figure as a test case for free speech.\n\nKey learnings:\n- According to the author, free speech should be used to protect everyone, regardless of their opinions.\n- When it comes to defending free speech, the selection of the test case is important in order to gain public support.\n\nKey questions:\n- What criteria should be used to select a speaker/test case for free speech?\n- How can we promote the value of free speech without resorting to controversial figures? \n- Is the principle of free speech only valid for likeable and popular people?"
