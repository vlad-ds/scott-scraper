    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Polls from the past few years suggest that support for Trumpism's positions decreases across various issues as soon as Trump enters the national stage.\n- Support for global free trade and moral support for immigrants unexpectedly spiked after the 2016 election.\n- The European study found that support for the EU increased after Trump's election, suggesting a rally effect.\n- Possible explanations for this trend are Trump's offensiveness, a shift in the Republican narrative, a focus shift by Democrats and the mainstream media, a goalpost shift, and the effects of disruptive protests.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Trump's aversiveness can harm his cause and cause backlash effects.\n- Civility and honesty are not always pointless.\n- People tend to overestimate the importance of turning out the base and underestimate the importance of not having everyone hate them.\n\nKey questions:\n- What are the possible mechanisms behind the trend of decreasing support for Trumpist positions?\n- How can the effects of the European study be applied in other countries and contexts?\n- What are the specific consequences of Trump's aversiveness on his cause and on the country as a whole?"
