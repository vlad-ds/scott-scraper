    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Cultural evolution refers to the preservation of useful ideas and tips.\n- Two types of cultural evolution are within-culture and between-culture evolution.\n- Intracultural evolution can't be used to override people's decisions about whether they're happy doing something or not.\n\nKey learnings\n- The first form of cultural evolution, which refers to within-culture evolution, works through a process of natural selection.\n- The second form of cultural evolution, which refers to between-culture evolution, is akin to group selectionism.\n- The cultural evolution argument for traditional sexuality seems to be trying to argue in the absence of, or in parallel to, observable historical lessons.\n\nKey questions\n- What is the difference between the obvious Inuit form of cultural evolution and the non-obvious marriage form?\n- How long is a \"generation\" in cultural evolution?\n- What is the extent of the selective advantage conferred by an individual cultural trait?"
