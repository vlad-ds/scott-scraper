    "summary": "Key ideas\n- The man who set the record for fastest drive across the US did it in 28 hours 50 minutes.\n- Environmentalist groups are supporting opponents of their cause who are less bad than others from their party.\n- People who are richer, whiter, and better educated are less likely to support prizes for participation.\n- Marijuana use may not be involved in more fatal accidents in Colorado after legalization.\n- Climate geo-engineering is seen as a more attractive solution for reversing some effects of global warming.\n- Poverty has no ability to explain criminality rates.\n- An analysis of a study showing that \"connectedness and sense of purpose\" can influence gene expression in positive ways has proved that its statistical methods are flawed.\n- Israeli wars may not be aimed at changing things but rather as some sort of tension-release cycle to maintain status quo.\n\nKey learnings\n- Supporting opponents of your cause who are less bad than others from their party can serve as an incentive for opposing politicians to moderate their views.\n- Personal identity is a concept that needs to be jettisoned.\n- Poverty may have no ability to explain criminality rates.\n- A critical analysis of a study can reveal flaws in the statistical methods used to find a certain effect.\n\nKey questions\n- Why do richer, whiter, and more educated individuals support winner-take-all policies?\n- Does poverty have no role in causing criminality rates?\n- What is the implication of the flawed statistical methods used in the study that showed that \"connectedness and sense of purpose\" can impact gene expression?"
