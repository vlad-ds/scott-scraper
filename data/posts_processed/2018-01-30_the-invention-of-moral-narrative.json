    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Modern pop culture is obsessed with the battle between good and evil\n- Traditional folktales rarely had a clear good vs. evil plot\n- Good guys are typically scrappy amateurs and bad guys are well-organized professionals with a lack of respect for human life\n- Good vs. evil narratives arose from a political vision and were used to promote social stability and encourage people to sign up for armies and fight in wars\n- Good vs. evil stories do not possess any moral sophistication, and the values presented do not arise from a moral vision, but rather a political one\n\nKey learnings:\n- Nationalism may have played a role in the rise of good vs. evil narratives but is not a complete explanation\n- The democratization process may have marked a shift from warrior virtues to populist virtues in storytelling\n- Good vs. evil stories are not more conducive to blind nationalism than past stories, as past stories celebrated loyalty\n- Properly written good vs. evil stories may be better in a memetic sense \n\nKey questions:\n- Why are most modern epic movies focused on good versus evil plots?\n- Did nationalism contribute to an increase in good vs. evil stories, or is there a different explanation?\n- What is the relationship between Greek paganism and the narrative structure of the Iliad, and between Christianity and the narrative structure of Harry Potter?\n- Is there anything else waiting to be good-vs-evil-ified, and what form will that take?"
