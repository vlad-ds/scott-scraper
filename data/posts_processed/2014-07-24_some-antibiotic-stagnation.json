    "summary": "Key ideas\n- A graph about using antibiotics to measure the rate of scientific progress is circulating the internet.\n- The graph is inaccurate: several listed drugs are not antibiotics, while important antibiotics are left out.\n- Antibiotic discovery has declined but is not as severe as the graph suggests.\n- Antibiotic discovery has become more complex, expensive, and time-consuming over time; the regulatory pathway to antibiotic approval is also poor.\n\nKey learnings\n- Antibiotic discovery has declined, but not as much as the inaccurate graph suggests.\n- Antibiotic discovery has become more complex, expensive, and time-consuming over time, with poor regulatory pathways to approval.\n\nKey questions\n- What are the three principal causes of the antibiotic market failure?\n- How does the FDA approve antibacterials, and why is it problematic?\n- What is the cause of the decline in antibiotic discovery in addition to the scientific complexity, economic incentives, and regulatory pathway issues?"
