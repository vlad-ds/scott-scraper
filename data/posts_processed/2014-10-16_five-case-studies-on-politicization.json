    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Ebola has been politicized in the US, with both political tribes taking opposing positions.\n- There are three theories for how this happened: fear of disease and the root of conservatism, mutual reinforcement of political beliefs, and the adoption of a quarantine position that fits a party's narrative.\n- Politicization isn't necessarily about what side you take, but what issues you emphasize.\n- The Rotherham scandal in the UK was largely ignored by the Left, while the Right vocalized about it in relation to their established narratives.\n- Left-leaning news websites and feminist websites had more coverage on the Jennifer Lawrence nude photo leaks than on the Rotherham child exploitation scandal.\n- Ferguson and Rotherham were both cases of police misconduct involving race, but news sources covering one issue did not necessarily cover the other.\n- Turning important topics into wedge issues that are used to insult and abuse opposing groups does not work.\n- People interpret issues based on their political affiliation and use them to support their narrative.\n- \"Attack nerds\" is a type of people trying to enforce traditional gender performance.\n- Nerds should ally themselves with people who support alternative gender performance.\n- The media has a role in promoting division and negative feelings between political groups.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Political tribes may take a position on an issue largely to fit their narrative, rather than objectively evaluating the situation.\n- Politicization can be detrimental to addressing important issues and instead be used as a means to signal allegiance to one's tribe.\n- Issues become tied to political narratives and stop being about themselves.\n- The media covers issues based on their alignment with a particular narrative.\n- Partisan affiliation influences one\u2019s beliefs on certain issues.\n- The media has the incentive to prioritize profits over promoting dialogue or understanding between political groups.\n- Social pressure can influence people's opinions and beliefs.\n\nKey questions:\n- Is it possible for individuals to separate from their political tribe and make objective evaluations of issues?\n- How can we effectively address important issues that have been politicized?\n- What is the role of media in exacerbating political polarization and how can it be improved?\n- Why do people seize upon different sides of a nonpolitical issue based on their political narrative?\n- How can people be convinced to support an issue that is not aligned with their political narrative?\n- How do people\u2019s beliefs about an issue change when it becomes a Referendum On Everything?\n- How can we incentivize the media to promote dialogue and understanding instead of division?\n- Can we encourage more people to think for themselves, rather than be influenced by social pressure or outside factors?\n"
