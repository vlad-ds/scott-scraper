    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Wage decoupling refers to the disconnection between median wages and productivity since 1973.\n- Data shows that this is not always the case for other countries and time periods, but the modern decoupling is significant.\n- Some argue that apparent wage stagnation is due to compensation in benefits such as health insurance, but data suggests otherwise.\n- Changing demographics and inflation measurement have also been proposed as explanations, but their significance is uncertain.\n- Labor vs capital inequality may offer a potential explanation.\n- Labor-vs-capital inequality is about how much wage earners earn vs. how much capitalists get in profits.\n- The tech industry is more capital-intensive, which causes capital's share of the pie to go up.\n- Increased wage inequality and policy changes are significant contributors to wage stagnation and decoupling.\n- Contrary to popular belief, wages have not stagnated since 1973.\n- Measurement issues have made things look worse than they actually are.\n- There is a 50% real decoupling between median wages and productivity.\n- Increasing wage inequality is the most important factor, with increasing labor-capital inequality also contributing.\n- Increasing wage inequality is likely due to taxation and corporate governance policies, as well as deunionization to some extent.\n- Automation and globalization also play a smaller role in wage inequality.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Wage decoupling is a complex issue with no clear consensus on a single factor causing it.\n- Technical points about inflation could explain a significant portion of the wage stagnation phenomenon.\n- Labor vs. capital inequality has been suggested as another potential explanation.\n- Labor-vs-capital inequality explains 10-20% of decoupling since 2000.\n- Increased wage inequality explains 20-47% of wage stagnation and decoupling.\n- Technology may explain moderately better pay for the top 10%, but it doesn't explain the stratospheric increase in the share of the 1%.\n- Median wages have probably risen 40-50% since 1973.\n- Inflation miscalculations, wages vs. total compensation, labor vs. capital inequality, deunionization, policies permitting high executive salaries, globalization, and automation all contribute to wage decoupling.\n\nKey questions:\n- Is there a consensus on the primary cause of wage decoupling?\n- How significant are the technical points regarding inflation in explaining wage stagnation?\n- How can policymakers address wage decoupling, particularly in response to the potential impact of labor vs capital inequality?\n- Why is labor-vs-capital inequality increasing?\n- Is wage inequality increasing because of technology?\n- Is wage inequality increasing because of policy changes?\n- How much should we care about the difference between inflation indices?\n- Who is right about the estimate of how much of the gap inconsistent deflators explain?\n- Does the Summers & Stansbury paper argue against policy-based wage inequality as a cause of median wage stagnation, at least until 2000?\n- Are there enough high-paid executives at companies whose money would have increased significantly more in step with productivity if redistributed to all employees?\n- What caused past episodes of wage decoupling in the US, and what ended them?\n- How do we square the apparent multifactorial nature of wage decoupling with its sudden beginning in 1973 and with the general argument against multifactorial trends?\n"
