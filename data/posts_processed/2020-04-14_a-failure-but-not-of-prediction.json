    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Vox concludes that the media needs to be better at saying what they don't know\n- The media failed to adequately warn about the pandemic and actively mocked those who did\n- Predicting the scale of the pandemic in mid-February was difficult\n- Making decisions is about more than just having certain beliefs, it's also about how you act on them\n- Common sense is not enough for medical interventions, RCTs are necessary\n- The media relied on expert opinions and did not ask about percent confidence in their positions\n- Generic smart people on Twitter were better at probabilistic reasoning than domain experts in predicting pandemic.\n- Zeynep Tufekci, a sociologist and journalist, is good at treating something as important even without enough evidence that it has to be.\n- Kelsey Piper gave exactly the correct advice in February 2020 to institutions and individuals on how to prepare for the worst-case scenario.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Predicting the future is hard and even the best predictive institutions can get it wrong\n- Decision-making requires a combination of beliefs and actions\n- RCTs are necessary for medical interventions\n- Being good at handling uncertainty matters more than getting predictions exactly right.\n- Giving the right advice and encouraging preparedness is crucial even when predictions are uncertain.\n\nKey questions:\n- How can the media improve at saying what they don't know?\n- What is the best way to balance common sense and RCTs in decision-making?\n- Should journalists ask experts about their percent confidence in their positions?\n- What can be done to improve probabilistic reasoning among domain experts in predicting pandemics?\n- How can the media strike a balance between acknowledging uncertainty and providing clear advice for individuals and institutions to prepare for worst-case scenarios?\n- What can individuals and institutions do to better prepare for future potential disasters, even when predicting their occurrence is uncertain?\n"
