    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Philip Morris and KFC are pivoting to smoke-free and meatless options respectively\n- Companies that formerly provided the \"smoky meaty past\" are now providing smoke-free meatless options\n- There is a debate on whether or not to allow these companies to profit from their past bad behavior\n\nKey learnings\n- Tobacco-free cigarettes and meat substitutes have helped people quit smoking and become vegetarian, respectively\n- It may be beneficial to let evil companies avoid punishment if they are willing to change their behavior\n- Boycotting specific companies is difficult due to the existence of parent companies or subsidiary companies in their supply chain\n\nKey questions\n- Does allowing formerly evil companies to profit from positive change make a mockery of that change?\n- Should companies be punished in order to encourage them to do good, or is the threat of punishment enough?\n- What is the right course of action: punish evil companies regardless, let them avoid punishment if they change, or punish them after they have stopped doing evil?"
