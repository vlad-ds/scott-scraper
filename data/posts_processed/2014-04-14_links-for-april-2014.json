    "summary": "Key Ideas:\n- Korean corporation purchased land in Canada for an agricultural project but never grew any crops\n- UFO cult built a clinic in Burkina Faso to reverse female genital mutilation and accuses the Catholic Church of thwarting them\n- Kenya\u2019s high use of mobile-phone based money transfer makes it fertile ground for cryptocurrency use\n- Awareness weeks to reduce stigma may actually increase self-stigma\n- Norway's army addressed sexual harassment by making men and women share rooms and encouraging similar hairstyles\n- People have more positive emotions towards words typed primarily with the right hand\n- A study finds 90% of academic papers are never cited, up to 50% are never read by anyone except authors and peer reviewers\n- Garden path sentences are a cool way to observe the hidden mechanisms of one's brain at work\n- Female wealth and education may increase risk of violence instead of decreasing it\n- Gifted children allowed to skip grades are much more likely to get doctoral degrees, patents, and STEM PhDs\n- Higher levels of creatine may be linked to better labor market outcomes and preliminary studies find it to be effective against depression\n\nKey Learnings:\n- Cultures can influence crime and must be considered in medical diagnoses\n- Crowdfunded investment of new companies for as little as $100 may be one of the most important economic events of the decade\n- Being a gifted child has significant positive impacts, but schools allocate less than 1/2000th the funding for gifted education as special education for low performers\n\nKey Questions:\n- How did clowns become scary when children are born with a fear of them?\n- Are genetic copy-number variants really important in understanding interesting psychosocial phenomena?\n- Should gifted children not be held back by offending others or the lack of funding for gifted education?"
