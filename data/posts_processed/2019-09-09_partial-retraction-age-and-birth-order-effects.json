    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Two years ago, Scott found that firstborn children were overrepresented in SSC survey data.\n- Last year, Scott found that age gaps of more than seven years attenuated birth order effects almost completely.\n- Bucky replicates some of Scott's results on birth order and age gaps but finds some errors in Scott's analysis.\n- Bucky identifies a potential confounder which affects the results.\n- Bucky concludes that there is a constant, high birth order effect for age gaps less than 4-8 years.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Birth order effects exist in the SSC survey data.\n- Age gaps of more than seven years attenuate birth order effects.\n- It's important to double-check results to avoid errors.\n- Potential confounders should be considered when analyzing data.\n\nKey questions:\n- What is the effect of family size on birth order effects?\n- How does birth order effect vary by age gap?\n- What other potential confounders may affect birth order effects?\n- How can we further replicate and verify these results?"
