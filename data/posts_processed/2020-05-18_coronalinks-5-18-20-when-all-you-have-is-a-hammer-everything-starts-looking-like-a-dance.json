    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Stay-at-home orders don't seem to have affected the percent of people staying at home, according to cell phone data.\n- Data shows that government policy isn't as much of a factor in controlling the virus as previously thought.\n- Speaking and singing loudly can increase the risk of transmission, and churches should be careful about reopening as a result.\n- Some people are law-abiding and haven't visited loved ones during the pandemic, and the government should acknowledge them.\n- A coronavirus prediction market is now available.\n- Metaculus provides a platform for users to make predictions and guesses on various topics related to the coronavirus pandemic\n- The author wonders about the potential need for ongoing restrictions if there is never a definitive solution to the pandemic\n- There is no consensus on how bad the impact of the pandemic has been compared to other causes of death or suffering\n- There is debate over the effectiveness of lockdowns and the possibility of achieving herd immunity through natural infection\n- Coronavirus has killed 90,000 Americans so far.\n- Comparing seasonal flu deaths to coronavirus deaths is problematic.\n- The coronavirus death toll only counts confirmed cases, whereas flu death toll counts estimated cases.\n- The number of confirmed flu deaths is only about 10,000 yearly.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Most people started staying at home before the official lockdown orders.\n- Government policy adds or subtracts a relatively small modifier to the wide variation of factors affecting the spread of the virus.\n- Speaking and singing loudly can greatly increase the risk of transmission.\n- The government should try to support law-abiding citizens who haven't visited loved ones during the pandemic.\n- Metaculus can be a useful tool for making predictions and gathering information about current events\n- The author cautions against relying on metaphors or other forms of comparison to understand the impact of the pandemic, as different comparisons can lead to vastly different conclusions\n- The author argues that the costs and benefits of different responses to the pandemic are complex and difficult to compare, and that different people may have different views on what policies are most effective or desirable\n- The comparison between coronavirus and seasonal flu deaths is not straightforward.\n- The number of confirmed coronavirus deaths is likely an underestimate of the actual number of deaths.\n- The CDC's reported flu death toll may not be a reliable estimate of actual flu deaths.\n\nKey questions:\n- Why are stay-at-home orders poorly enforced and not affecting the percent of people staying at home?\n- What factors are affecting the spread of the virus besides government policy?\n- Could the missing cultural vulnerability factor be how loud and spittle-filled people's speech is?\n- Can the government do more to support the law-abiding citizens who haven't visited loved ones during the pandemic?\n- What are the most effective ways to predict or respond to a pandemic like COVID-19?\n- How can we balance the need to control the spread of the virus with the economic and social costs of lockdowns and other restrictions?\n- What factors determine how different individuals or groups evaluate the impact of the pandemic, and how can we address disagreements or misunderstandings in these evaluations?\n- Where are the latest active pools for pooling donations to reach the amount needed for a matching donation?\n- How can we accurately compare the death tolls of coronavirus and seasonal flu?\n- Should the CDC lower the reported flu death toll to signal that we should worry less about the flu compared to coronavirus?\n"
