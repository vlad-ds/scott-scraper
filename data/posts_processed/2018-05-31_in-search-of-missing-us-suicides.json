    "summary": "Key ideas\n- US states with high gun ownership have high suicide rates but not necessarily high homicide rates.\n- Access to guns increases suicide rates.\n- Suicide methods are not fungible but the US still has a relatively low suicide rate, which is an artefact of high gun availability.\n- If the US had gun control similar to Britain, its suicide rate would be much lower.\n- The US is religious, culturally similar to Britain, and ethnically diverse, which may be additional factors driving down its base rate of suicides.\n\nKey learnings\n- Restrictions on access to common means of suicide have led to lower suicide rates.\n- Removing guns from a state does decrease its suicide rate.\n- A gun-free US would have one of the lowest suicide rates in the developed world.\n\nKey questions\n- Why is there a clear relationship between gun ownership and suicide rates but not between gun ownership and homicide rates in the US?\n- Why doesn't the US have a higher suicide rate given the high availability of guns? \n- How does the US' religious, cultural, and ethnic diversity contribute to its lower suicide rate?"
