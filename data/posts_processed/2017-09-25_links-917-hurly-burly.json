    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Forest rings: unexplained phenomena where trees form circular patterns similar to fairy rings\n- Allergan transferred patent on a popular drug to a Native American tribe to protect it from certain federal intellectual property laws\n- Evergreen State College faces enrollment drop and budget shortfall after social justice protests and vandalism\n- Artificial intelligence can apparently determine sexuality with 80% accuracy from facial images\n- Suicide rates have increased by a third in the past ten years, disproportionately affecting the less educated\n\nKey learnings:\n- Dutch approach to agriculture and food exports could lead the way for a more sustainable food production\n- The Kellogg-Briand Pact banning aggressive war was successful in preventing conflicts, despite its poor contemporary reputation\n- Autistic individuals are eight times more likely to be transgender compared to the general population\n- Sharing social context rather than creating associations or desires may be the goal of effective advertising\n\nKey questions:\n- Could the transfer of the patent by Allergen have wider legal, moral or socio-economic implications?\n- Will other pharma companies follow Allergen\u2019s example in protecting their patents this way and how could that affect the wider pharma industry?\n- Could Trump administration policies explain the uptick in suicide rates among the less educated?\n- How accurate is facial recognition technology in the context of sexuality and could this be used oppressively?"
