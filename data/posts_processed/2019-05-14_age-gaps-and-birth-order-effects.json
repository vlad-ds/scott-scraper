    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Psychologists are split on the existence of \u201cbirth order effects\u201d.\n- Last year's survey revealed that SSC readers had a 70-30 imbalance in favor of older siblings.\n- Birth order effects may not affect IQ but could affect something like \u201cintellectual curiosity\u201d.\n- There are several possible explanations for why firstborns may be more intellectually curious than later-born siblings.\n- Age gaps affect the strength of birth order effects; people separated from their older siblings by more than seven years will act like firstborn children.\n- The results suggest that intra-family competition or parental investment may be the major cause of birth order effects.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Birth order effects exist but are weak and inconsistent.\n- The strength of birth order effects decreases after an age gap of seven years.\n- Intra-family competition or parental investment may be the major cause of birth order effects.\n\nKey questions:\n- Why are firstborns more intellectually curious?\n- How can we make laterborns more intellectually curious?\n- How does age gap affect birth order effects?\n- Is having a sibling in early childhood the cause of birth order effects, but one in middle childhood is not?\n- How do we distinguish between intra-family competition and parental investment hypotheses?"
