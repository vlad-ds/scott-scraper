    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- A neural net trained on change.org tries to write its own petitions\n- Charter schools can successfully scale up from a single school to a whole chain of schools.\n- An investigation into British UFO sightings determined some were inexplicable by normal standards, and posited \u201ca supernormal meteorological phenomena not fully understood by modern science\u2026\n- Penn study of school children finds those who nap midday are happier and do better in school.\n- The author shares various interesting and obscure facts, ranging from biographical information about a Saudi Arabian astronaut to a study about LSD microdosing\n- The author also mentions various events and movements, such as an AI conference and different leftist groups, and provides some commentary and analysis on them\n- The author discusses some news about climate change and expresses uncertainty about the risks and the level of concern\n\nKey learnings:\n- Exposure to an academic during your formative years may make you more likely to become psychotic.\n- Watching pornography as a teenager does not harm future sexual satisfaction.\n- The rise in social-justice-related terms as a percent of words used in the media over time.\n- GeneSight has discontinued its pharmacogenetic tests for ADHD and analgesic tests, admitting they don\u2019t work.\n- People may be interested in obscure or unusual information or stories\n- Even if some developments like AI progress can seem far off or unlikely, they may end up happening sooner than expected\n- Understanding and predicting the risks of climate change are complex, and it's not always straightforward to assess or interpret new research or news\n\nKey questions:\n- What can explain the increased risk for academics\u2019 children, siblings, and niblings, but not parents and grandparents?\n- Are global warming skeptics betting against future air conditioning demand?\n- Why did it take so long to discover that homophobia cut 12 years off the life expectancy of gays?\n- If schools replace punishment-based models of discipline (especially suspensions) with \u201crestorative justice\u201d does this help or hurt students succeed?\n- Why does anti-Japaneseism exist in Japan?\n- How worried should we be about the risks of climate change, and how much uncertainty is there in our understanding of the issue?\n- What is the significance of the different events or developments the author describes, and what can we learn from them?\n- How can we stay informed and critically evaluate sources of information, especially when they are unusual or not widely known?\n"
