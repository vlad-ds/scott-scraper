    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Ulpian\u2019s life table provides insight into ancient Roman mortality rates and predicted life expectancy at birth.\n- Structured interviews yield more reliable psychiatric diagnoses than ordinary practice.\n- Critics of psychiatric diagnosis often ignore the benefits it provides.\n- Chinese censorship extends to group chats in response to dissident activity.\n- Cruise ships are a major contributor to pollution and environmental damage, emitting the same amount of particulate matter daily as one million cars.\n- Drug offenders in the US are sometimes forced into difficult, dangerous working conditions in \u201crehabilitation camps\u201d.\n- Researchers discover connections between Viking and Islamic cultures.\n- A book on low-hanging fruit vs. the argument from humility is in the works.\n- Court rulings state that whales should be classified as fish in certain legal contexts.\n- Trump supporters are helping to fill the Republican Party\u2019s coffers.\n- Documents banned under the Terrorism Act include information on drone strikes and ISIS.\n\nKey learnings\n- Roman mortality rates were incredibly high, with predicted life expectancy at birth between 19 and 23 years.\n- Structured interviews provide more reliable psychiatric diagnoses than the current standard of practice.\n- It is important to consider the benefits of psychiatric diagnosis before criticizing its shortcomings. \n- Chinese censorship extends beyond official news sources to group chats, in order to prevent banned material from being spread.\n- Cruise ships contribute greatly to pollution and environmental damage.\n- \u201cRehabilitation camps\u201d in the US are often inhumane working environments.\n- Researchers discover interesting connections between Viking and Islamic cultures.\n- A book exploring low-hanging fruit vs. the argument from humility is in the works.\n- Court rulings place whales in the fish category for certain legal purposes.\n- Trump supporters have helped the Republican Party raise more funds for the upcoming midterm elections.\n- UK censorship has intensified, with harsh sentences being given for reading \u201cterrorist content\u201d.\n\nKey questions\n- What potential implications could more reliable psychiatric diagnoses have for patients?\n- How might the discovery of connections between Viking and Islamic cultures alter our understanding of history?\n- Will the investigation by the ACLU into the US \u201crehabilitation camps\u201d lead to meaningful change?\n- Is there a better solution for limiting pollution caused by cruise ships?\n- Will the adoption of structured interviews lead to more reliable psychiatric diagnoses in the future?"
