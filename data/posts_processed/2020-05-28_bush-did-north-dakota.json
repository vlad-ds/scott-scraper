    "summary": "Key ideas\n- 46% of Trump voters endorsed the Pizzagate conspiracy theory, but this isn't unique to them\n- A 2016 survey found that 33% of respondents endorsed a conspiracy theory about a nonexistent event\n- Polls that don't offer a \"don't know\" option force people to choose agreement or disagreement, and some will agree just because\n- There may be a \"North Dakota Constant\" of 33% for how many people will believe a conspiracy theory without reason\n- High-information voters who believe conspiracy theories are not discussed here\n\nKey learnings\n- Polls that don't offer a \"don't know\" option can skew results towards agreement\n- Conspiracy theorists may start with a high prior on any given conspiracy being true\n- There may be a significant portion of the population that will believe a conspiracy theory without reason\n\nKey questions\n- Why do some people stick to their prior and not change their beliefs even after getting more information?\n- Can we really conclude anything from specific statements about what percentage of a group believes a certain conspiracy theory?\n- Why is there a \"North Dakota Constant\" of 33% for people who will believe a conspiracy theory without reason?"
