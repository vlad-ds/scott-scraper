    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Slagging is a form of verbal cruelty among friends used as a bonding mechanism.\n- Countersignaling is the act of doing something opposite to prove the status one already possesses.\n- Teasing can lead to genuine social catastrophe if the friendship is not as strong as presumed.\n- The act of giving someone potential ammunition against you shows a lot of trust.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Countersignaling is prevalent in many forms of communication, including slagging.\n- Teasing can be seen as a signal of affection if done in the right spirit.\n- Friendships can be tested in when teasing isn't done playfully, and awkward situations can arise.\n- Antagonistic signals given between friends are a sign of trust only when there is no perceived possible threat. \n\nKey questions:\n- How can one distinguish between healthy verbal teasing and attempts at bullying?\n- Can countersignaling be harmful in certain situations?\n- Does our relationship choices affect the kind of countersignaling we exhibit?"
