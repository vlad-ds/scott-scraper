    "summary": "Key ideas\n\n- The author started criticizing social justice in 2010.\n- Social justice criticism is now present in big national media.\n- The author is uncomfortable with the sudden outpouring of support for their position.\n- The media is over-representing an insular demographic of Ivy League academics who don't notice things that don't affect them personally.\n- The author worries that social justice criticism is being defined by rhetorically-gifted Yale professors who will take over the wider movement.\n- The mass media seems to be defending Yale administrators and attacking activists for being weak rather than pointing out when they abuse their power.\n- The author thinks people should use better arguments about trigger warnings and safe spaces.\n\nKey learnings\n\n- Social justice criticism has entered the mainstream.\n- Criticizing social justice can be done from several angles.\n- The media's representation of social justice criticism may be incomplete and biased.\n- Social justice criticism may be hijacked by rhetorically-gifted academics who lack perspective.\n- The media's framing of social justice criticism may reveal biases and favored groups.\n\nKey questions\n\n- Does the media's representation of social justice criticism accurately reflect the broader social concern?\n- What risks does the wider social justice criticism movement face as it becomes more mainstream?\n- How can criticism of social justice be done effectively and constructively?\n- Are there better ways to prioritize initiatives to address social problems?"
