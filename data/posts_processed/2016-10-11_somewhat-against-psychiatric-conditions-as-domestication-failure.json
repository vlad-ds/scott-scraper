    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Benitez-Burraco and Lattanzi theorize that autism and schizophrenia are anomalies in the human self-domestication process\n- Similar changes occur in any species bred for tameness due to changes in the embryonic neural crest\n- BBL argues that autistic people are \u201cundomesticated humans\u201d and schizophrenics are \u201chyperdomesticated humans\u201d\n- The theory proposes that domesticated animals are friendlier and less aggressive, but schizophrenics aren't friendlier or less aggressive, unlike domesticated animals\n\nKey learnings\n- Domestication seems to be linked to a physiological social/trust system that determines the level of trust and sociability and is linked to ear and nose shape\n- Autism, schizophrenia, and Williams Syndrome all affect that system in different ways\n- Embryology can help pinpoint the particular systems involved in autism and schizophrenia\n\nKey questions\n- How could embryological research help pinpoint the particular systems involved in autism and schizophrenia?\n- Could a version of Williams Syndrome that only deleted WBSCR17 keep the behavioral and physiologic changes but not much else?"
