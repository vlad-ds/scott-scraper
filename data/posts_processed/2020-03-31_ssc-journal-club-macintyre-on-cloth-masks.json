    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Surgical masks used in hospitals are made of non-woven fabrics that are different from cloth masks.\n- Cloth masks block 60 \u2013 80% of virus particles in laboratory tests, while respirators and real surgical masks block 95%+.\n- An Australian team conducted a randomized controlled trial on hospital workers in Vietnam comparing the efficacy of surgical masks, cloth masks, and no masks.\n- The study found that surgical masks were the most effective in preventing infection, cloth masks were the least effective, and the control group was in the middle.\n- The authors lean towards the hypothesis that cloth masks are actively bad since they only examined incoming pathogens, which means there are still reasons to think they are helpful for blocking outgoing ones.\n\nKey learnings\n- Cloth masks might be helpful in blocking virus particles, but surgical masks are much more effective.\n- The only randomized controlled trial on cloth face masks shows that they are probably net harmful, but the study only examines incoming pathogens.\n- Cloth masks can be helpful in blocking outgoing virus particles, but until we can get real surgical masks, cloth masks are better than nothing.\n \nKey questions asked by the author (Scott)\n- Should people stay away from cloth masks? \n- What should we do since the only RCT of cloth masks shows they are probably net harmful?\n- What is the potential risk of using cloth masks for health care workers?"
