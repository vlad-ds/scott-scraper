    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Vox wrote about a report by the Brennan Center For Justice on theories for why crime rates declined in the US.\n- Vox argues that the lead-crime connection is overblown.\n- The Brennan Center's analysis suggests that there is no single \"smoking gun\" for why crime rates decreased.\n- The analysis suggests that about ten different factors, each explaining ten percent of the decline, were at play.\n\nKey learnings\n- Something as complicated as crime is governed by many factors, so it is unlikely that one big change caused such a significant decline in crime rates.\n- Vox argues that the lead-crime connection is overblown, but this could be disputed given that lead can remain in the environment for a long time.\n- The Brennan Center's analysis suggests that various factors, each contributing a small percentage to the decline in crime rates, were at play.\n\nKey questions\n- Can someone point Scott to literature that explores how much less likely a ten-factor explanation is compared to a one-factor explanation for the decline in crime rates?\n- Are there ways to calculate the likelihood of a ten-factor explanation for the decline in crime rates?"
