    "summary": "Key ideas\n- The 1972 book Limits to Growth has been criticized for predicting civilization would probably collapse some time this century.\n- Research from the University of Melbourne has found the book\u2019s forecasts on target.\n- The article outlines some graphs of important environment variables and points out the flaw in assuming a decline starting around 2015.\n- The grue-bleen induction problem is examined by the author.\n\nKey learnings\n- Predicting dramatic change is hard; success with one doesn\u2019t necessarily imply success with the other.\n- There is still a lot of good arguments that collapse could happen.\n- The data presented here provides only a small amount of evidence.\n\nKey questions\n- Does the conclusion from The Guardian urge readers to sound the appropriate alarm bell?\n- The grue-bleen induction problem is an exotic and especially perverse reasoning process that no real person would fall for. Do philosophers agree with this?"
