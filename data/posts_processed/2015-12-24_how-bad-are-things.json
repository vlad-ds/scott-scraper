    "summary": "Key ideas\n\n- As a psychiatrist, working with people who are miserable and struggling is a daily occurrence, even in wealthy and optimistic American towns.\n- Psychiatrists filter for misery and that theoretically makes them more prone to it.\n- People automatically have a bias to avoid those who are not like themselves.\n- The world has far more pain and suffering than we acknowledge or even imagine.\n\nKey learnings\n\n- Psychiatrists generally treat people who are suffering at the most extreme level of the spectrum.\n- The normal way of filtering the people that one meets in life makes it unlikely that one knows people with views that are vastly different from one's own.\n- Poll findings show that most people do not understand how many people are genuinely suffering.\n\nKey questions\n\n- Are people biased to filter their social circle based on socioeconomic status?\n- Is it possible for individuals to become aware of the extent of pain and suffering in the world and remain mentally healthy?"
