    "summary": "Key ideas\n- The Perpetual Peace, a treaty signed by Byzantines and Persians, lasted only eight years, and The Fifty Year Peace lasted only ten years.\n- Most state education rating systems rank state education success based on a combined measure of money spent as positive outcomes.\n- Researchers are experimenting with archaeology techniques to learn more about ancient people.\n- Researchers made progress in understanding how the brain holds faces.\n- The Cochrane Collaboration has experienced scandal.\n- A new crowdfunding site called Let\u2019s Fund is available to support effective altruism.\n\nKey learnings\n- It is dangerous to make blanket policies on cyberbullying.\n- The cost of raising the salary offered for a single position is much higher than X, as all existing employees would need their salaries raised as well.\n- There are euphemisms for the word \"bear\" in many Indo-European languages due to a fear that speaking the true name may summon it.\n\nKey questions\n- What other treaties exist that were similarly named and designed to last indefinitely but failed to do so?\n- Can state education ranking systems be improved to account for factors other than money?\n- What are other ways researchers can experiment with archaeology?\n- What implications does understanding how the brain holds faces have for the future of facial recognition technology?\n- Can the Cochrane Collaboration recover from this scandal, and what does this mean for trustworthy research institutions?\n- What other effective altruism crowdfunding sites exist, and how do they differ from Let's Fund?"
