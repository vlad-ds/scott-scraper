    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Griggs vs. Duke Power Co. case is often used as a scapegoat for credential-ocracy.\n- The restrictions on college degrees are similar to that of IQ tests.\n- Other countries still face similar credential requirements without the Griggs ruling.\n- Some fields use standardized tests, but credentials still matter for competitiveness.\n\nKey learnings:\n- The Griggs case may not be the main cause of credential-ocracy.\n- Standardized tests, such as the SAT, may not be utilized for IQ testing in job interviews.\n- Credentials may still matter even in fields with universal standardized tests.\n\nKey questions:\n- Is there something deeper causing credential-ocracy beyond the Griggs case and standardized testing?\n- Why are foreign students with high USMLE scores overlooked for residencies in medicine in favor of US-trained candidates?\n- How can the reliance on credentials in certain fields be reduced?"
