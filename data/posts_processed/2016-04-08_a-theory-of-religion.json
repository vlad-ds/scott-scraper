    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- The author explores the origins of religion and how ancient religion differed from modern religion.\n- The author argues that the key to religion is having a rallying flag that preserves certain cultural values and walls against the outside world.\n- The author suggests that the development of formalized religious texts contributed to the ossification and separation from context of religious beliefs.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Ancient religion was inseparable from culture, unlike modern religion.\n- American civil religion has many of the features of ancient religion, but lacks the cultural separation and ossification.\n- Ossification and separation from context are key to the evolution of a religion into a formalized structure.\n\nKey questions:\n- What makes a rallying flag for a religion, and how does it differ from other cultural symbols?\n- How does the separation from context and ossification of religious beliefs affect their evolution?\n- What role do subcultures play in the evolution of religions?"
