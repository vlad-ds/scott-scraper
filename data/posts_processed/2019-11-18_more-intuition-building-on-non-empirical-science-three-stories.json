    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Two theories can make identical predictions but differ in other ways that are important to consider.\n- Choosing the simpler theory among identical ones requires understanding of philosophy.\n- The number of entities in a theory is not the only factor to consider when determining which theory is simpler.\n\nKey learnings\n- Making accurate predictions is not the only important factor when evaluating a theory.\n- Determining which of two identical theories is simpler can require a detailed understanding of philosophy and the assumptions underlying each theory.\n- The number of entities in a theory is not the only factor to consider when determining which theory is simpler.\n\nKey questions\n- How can one determine which theory is simpler among two that make identical predictions?\n- What are some examples of theories that make identical predictions but differ in other important ways?\n- How can the two previous morals be applied to other areas of science or philosophy?"
