    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Morality can be thought of as a force, similar to gravity.\n- Words and phrases commonly associated with gravity are also used to describe immoral behavior.\n- Moral force decreases with the square of the distance between two objects.\n- Calculations based on inverse square laws can predict moral actions.\n\nKey learnings\n- Our moral obligations decrease with distance, with ourselves being the most important obligation.\n- The margin of error in predicting charitable contributions based on the inverse square law is very small.\n- We can use the inverse square law to determine how close we need to be to a beggar before we are no longer morally obligated to give them money.\n\nKey questions\n- Can other forces be used to explain morality?\n- How do cultural and societal values impact our moral obligations?\n- What are the limitations of using this methodology to determine moral obligations?"
