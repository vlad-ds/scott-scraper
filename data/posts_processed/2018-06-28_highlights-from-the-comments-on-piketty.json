    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Matt Rognlie claimed that Piketty did not correctly account for capital depreciation in his calculations.\n- Housing is a real source of inequality, but not all homeowners are rentiers.\n- Private equity funds are a way that super rich people can have higher returns on their investments, but there are risks involved.\n- The measurement problems in Piketty-Saez's income distribution statistics invalidate his larger prescriptive argument in favor of highly progressive tax rates.\n- Piketty's claim that the rising rentier class will dominate the 21st century doesn't hold up.\n- There is significant academic debate over Piketty's empirical data.\n- The claim that the super-rich get much better returns on investment than everyone else doesn't really hold up.\n- Piketty's rules of thumb for growth do not hold up well.\n\nKey learnings:\n- There are technical details that Piketty did not consider in his book, which Rognlie addressed in his paper.\n- Different datasets provide different results regarding inequality measurements, and Piketty used the most dramatic ones in his book.\n- Private equity funds are a way for super rich people to invest, but it involves significant risks, and not everyone is advised to invest in them.\n- The increasing number of rentiers in a post-scarcity robot future is not necessarily bad.\n- A wealth tax may not be an effective policy for inequality.\n\nKey questions:\n- Does Piketty's book really disprove his most shocking thesis?\n- How do colleges with different amounts of endowment achieve higher returns on their investments?\n- How can we account for changes in the tax codes when measuring income distributions?\n- Did WWII have long-run positive effects on Europe's GDP, and why?\n- Does Piketty provide a justification for the sharp discontinuity in his graph?\n- Does Piketty's argument apply only to the US or also to Europe?\n- Should we invest more in light of r>>g?\n- Is anything from Piketty still worth keeping?\n"
