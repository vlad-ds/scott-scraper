    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Circumcision reduces the risk of penile cancer by 90%, UTIs by 90%, and HIV transmission by 50%.\n- There is weak evidence that circumcision reduces rates of HPV, HSV, bacterial vaginosis, and trichomonas.\n- Circumcision has risks including pain, bleeding, bruising, infection, and scarring.\n- The foreskin is highly innervated and sensitivity may be reduced, but sexual satisfaction appears to be unchanged.\n- Infants are better equipped than adults to handle a loss of nerves due to brain plasticity.\n- The ethics of infant circumcision depend on one\u2019s ethical system.\n\nKey learnings\n- Infant circumcision reduces the risk of penile cancer, UTIs, and HIV, but has risks.\n- There is weak evidence that circumcision reduces rates of some STIs and none for sensitivity to sexual stimulation.\n- The benefits and risks of infant circumcision are a matter of ethics.\n\nKey questions\n- What is the best way to balance the risks and benefits of infant circumcision?\n- What are the implications of the weak evidence for reduction in STIs and lack of evidence for sensitivity to sexual stimulation?\n- How can ethical concerns about personal autonomy and reinforcing heteronormativity be addressed when considering infant circumcision?"
