    "summary": "Key ideas\n- The author conducted a test to see if people could accurately predict changes in American values over time.\n- The test asked for three things: the percentage of Americans who agree with certain statements, the change in percentage since 1987, and the political position of the person taking the test.\n- The author hypothesized that most people would underestimate the strength of their political position due to the underdog effect.\n- The author acknowledges that the test is flawed due to potential differences in wording from the original survey.\n\nKey learnings\n- The author will post the answers and data from the test soon.\n- The test was not rigged and the author did not peek at the answers.\n- The test may not be completely accurate due to differences in wording from the original survey.\n\nKey questions\n- How accurate were people in predicting changes in American values over time?\n- Will the results confirm the author\u2019s hypothesis about the underdog effect?\n- How will Neoreactionaries, who believe in the power of the Cathedral, perform on the test?"
