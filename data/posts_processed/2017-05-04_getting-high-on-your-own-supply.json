    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Debate over what went wrong in Hillary Clinton's campaign and how Democrats can change before 2018 or 2020\n- Some argue that focusing on identity politics and not appealing to the white working class was a mistake\n- Changing the epistemic culture of the party might be necessary for deep change\n- Emphasizing an electable epistemic culture may not be the best for running a party or governing a nation\n- Segregation in ideological bubbles exists, but most people online choose not to engage with news\n\nKey learnings:\n- Democrats may need to make deep changes to address certain criticisms of their party and increase their chances of winning elections\n- Focusing on winning elections and appealing to voters may come at the cost of governing effectively\n- Most people are not engaged with news, which may limit the impact of media outlets' influence\n\nKey questions:\n- Should the Democrats act superficially to address criticisms, or should they make deep changes to their epistemic culture?\n- Is an epistemic culture that sounds electable the same culture that makes the party competent?\n- Are publications that argue for emotions over facts themselves using emotional appeals?\n- Should publications append caveats that they will remain factual and rational when advocating for abandoning facts and reason?"
