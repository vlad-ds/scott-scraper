    "summary": "Key ideas\n- The theory of \"voodoo death\" refers to people dying after being cursed by witch doctors; previously thought to be caused by adrenaline, now believed to be more complex.\n- Many psychological theories and concepts seem to have a \"voodoo-ish\" quality, such as the placebo effect, stereotype threat, and self-esteem, that aren't as powerful as once believed.\n- A trend in psychology seems to be moving away from the power of the unconscious mind, with studies showing that it doesn't necessarily control our behavior as much as previously thought.\n\nKey learnings\n- The power of the mind doesn't necessarily have as profound an impact on our lives as some psychological theories once claimed.\n- The role of the unconscious mind in behavior and decision-making may not be as powerful as previously assumed.\n\nKey questions\n- Do all psychological theories and concepts have a \"voodoo-ish\" quality, or are only certain ones prone to this?\n- How accurate are current beliefs about the role of the unconscious mind in behavior and decision-making?\n- What other psychological concepts or theories may be prone to exaggeration or over-generalization?"
