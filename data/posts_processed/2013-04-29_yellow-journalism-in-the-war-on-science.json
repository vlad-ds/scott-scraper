    "summary": "Key ideas\n- A new draft bill is making its way through the House called \u201cThe High Quality Research Act\u201d\n- The bill changes the review process for grant funding by replacing domain experts with the head of the NSF.\n- The bill bans the duplication of studies, a process where researchers apply for multiple grants for the same research without informing one grant agency that they already received funding from another.\n- The bill restricts funding to research that promotes national interests, advances health, welfare, prosperity, and defense by promoting scientific progress.\n- Some politicians have criticized the study of basic research or what they perceive as frivolous studies, which has led to the debate about NSF funding criteria and priorities.\n\nKey learnings\n- Misinformation and sensationalism from designated outrage factories cause panic and bias in reading texts.\n- The bill doesn't ban peer review or replication of studies but aims to reduce duplicates in grant applications.\n- The restriction of funding to research that promotes national interest may affect basic research and social science.\n- The bill is a debate about the validity and priorities of some NSF-funded research projects.\n\nKey questions\n- What is the impact of the new bill on future scientific research?\n- How do politicians decide which scientific studies are worthwhile to fund?\n- How can we balance practicality and curiosity in scientific research?"
