    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Developing new antidepressants is really hard\n- NSI-189 was highly anticipated as a new experimental antidepressant that directly targets neurogenesis\n- However, NSI-189 failed in FDA trials on the primary endpoint (MADRS)\n- Neuralstem has recently released new secondary endpoints from the same trial, some of which showed positive results\n- These new secondary endpoints are divided among different scales and only appear in certain doses, leading to skepticism\n\nKey learnings:\n- Depression has a high placebo response rate, which makes drug development difficult\n- Pharma companies have given up on developing new antidepressants, leaving the field to academia and self-experimentation\n- Secondary endpoints can be prone to spurious positive findings, and the primary endpoint should be pre-identified\n\nKey questions:\n- What new results did Neuralstem release, and can they be believed?\n- Is investors' job to answer \"Does this drug work?\" or rather \"Will investing in this stock make me money?\""
