    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- A viral list of scientific mavericks who were ridiculed but later vindicated has been going around.\n- Arrhenius, Alfven, Baird and Bretz are examples of people who were doubted for very short periods and then became accepted in their fields.\n- Bakker, Bardeen and Brattain, Chladni, Doppler, Crick and Watson, and Chandrasekhar do not match the pattern in the list.\n- Rather than challenging scientific consensus, we should focus on improving it.\n- The author (Scott) reflects on several cases where he defied scientific consensus and was proven wrong, showing the accuracy of scientific consensus.\n- The author cites examples of scientific fields that have maintained strong commitments to the truth in the face of pressure.\n- The author discusses the importance of recognizing paradigm shifts and cutting-edge scientists criticizing old paradigms.\n- Scientific consensus reflects the best knowledge we have at the time\n- Individual studies may not accurately reflect the consensus\n- Confirmation bias may lead to cherry-picking experts who agree with us\n- Trust in scientific consensus is a prosocial thing to do\n- Demands for consensus can be used to shut down people who are actually right\n- Even when the consensus is correct, pursuing a hunch that it isn't can be valuable\n\nKey learnings:\n- Scientific consensus is the best tool we have for seeking truth but it is not perfect.\n- Many scientists took the replication crisis very seriously and are trying to change the way they practice research.\n- Most nutrition scientists don't believe in the Bad Old Paradigm and haven't for a while.\n- A lot of sketchy ideas may not be popular among academics who support social justice.\n- Scientific consensus has been unreasonably accurate, despite human fallibility and political pressure.\n- Paradigm shifts are part of the process of science and should be recognized as such.\n- Cutting-edge scientists may raise valid criticisms of old paradigms.\n- Scientific consensus represents a collective evaluation of work by hundreds of scientists over decades\n- Relying solely on individual studies may not provide an accurate picture of the consensus\n- Confirmation bias may lead to selective interpretation of scientific consensus\n- Trusting in scientific consensus can be beneficial for society\n- Respect for scientific consensus should not be used to silence dissenting voices\n- Pursuing an Inside View hunch can be valuable, even when the consensus is correct\n\nKey questions:\n- Why do people focus on cases of scientific mavericks, rather than on cases where the scientific community reaches a consensus and gets something right?\n- How can we best promote scientific progress, given the limits of scientific consensus?\n- How can we distinguish between scientific consensus that's wrong and fringe theories that are wrong?\n- How should we deal with cases where the scientific consensus turns out to be wrong?\n- Is it possible for certain scientific fields to maintain a commitment to the truth while others do not?\n- How can we recognize when a paradigm shift is happening versus when there is a true scientific controversy?\n- What role do biases, including political biases, play in scientific consensus?\n- Is scientific consensus always an accurate representation of the best knowledge we have?\n- How can we avoid confirmation bias when interpreting scientific consensus?\n- When is it appropriate to deviate from scientific consensus?\n- How can we promote a norm of agreeing with scientific consensus without empowering those who use it for their own agendas?\n- How can we encourage scientists to voice their doubts about the consensus without undermining public trust in scientific institutions?\n"
