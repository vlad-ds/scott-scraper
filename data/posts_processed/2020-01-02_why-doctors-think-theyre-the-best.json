    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- 90% of doctors think they are above-average doctors.\n- Doctors may fall into traps, including overestimating their skills, selection bias, and not noticing when patients switch to other doctors.\n- Every doctor may make errors at the same rate but about different things.\n- Doctors satisfy their own values and trade-offs.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Selection bias is dangerous as patients who love their doctor will stick with them longer.\n- Doctors underestimate and lack self-awareness of their shortcomings.\n- Doctors can't notice their own errors, which may lead to misdiagnosis.\n\nKey questions:\n- Do other professions outside the medical field face a similar tendency to fall into these traps?\n- Would it be helpful for doctors to have their patients submit feedback to improve their self-awareness of their shortcomings?"
