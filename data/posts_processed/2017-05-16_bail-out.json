    "summary": "Key Ideas:\n- About a fifth of the incarcerated US population are listed as \"not convicted\".\n- Some people can't afford bail and end up in jail until their trial, which could take a while.\n- People detained pretrial end up getting longer sentences.\n- A short-term solution is to pay people's bail. In the long-term, criminal justice reform is needed.\n\nKey Learnings:\n- Bail causes people to be stuck in jail for months, increases guilty pleas independent of defendants' actual guilt, and causes more convictions and longer sentences.\n- Bail is supposed to serve a useful purpose in preventing suspects from running away, but it's possible to go without it.\n- Paying the bail of 50% of the people currently awaiting trial in the US would be well within the abilities of one philanthropic-feeling billionaire.\n\nKey Questions:\n- Who do you want to release: the robbers, or the murderers?\n- Is bail really necessary to prevent suspects from running away?\n- What are the real numbers when it comes to the success rates of bail-related charities?"
