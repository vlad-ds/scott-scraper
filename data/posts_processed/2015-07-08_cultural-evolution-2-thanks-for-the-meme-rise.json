    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Cultural evolution can happen through a super-innovation that allows one culture to conquer all others or when one group in a society outbreeds another.\n- Cultural evolution can happen with subcultures that undergo evolution conforming to population genetic equations in a reasonable amount of time, and spread quickly as people rush to join the attractive ones.\n- Cultural evolution can occur by an accretion of things that work and first rituals might have been impromptu celebrations of specific events, but because they helped people bond, people kept doing them.\n- Cultural evolution could have occurred way back in prehistory.\n\nKey learnings:\n- The potential of cultural evolution to be interesting does not serve as a strong argument for preserving particular features of inherited culture absent other arguments suggesting we know why we want those things to be preserved.\n\nKey questions:\n- Can we trust anything that evolved in prehistory to still be relevant?\n- Are there historical examples of subcultures that became popular and spread and became dominant/universal?\n- Why are religions typically so slow to evolve compared to other cultural phenomena?"
