    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Harvard students plan to invite controversial speakers to their school to raise awareness of free speech.\n- Invoking free speech to justify unpopular ideas may lead to tolerance of those ideas but less popularity of free speech.\n- Free speech is a commons that needs to be protected and not drawn from too quickly.\n- Growing partisanship and tribalism can lead to the demise of free speech as a principle.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Invoking free speech requires careful consideration of the potential consequences.\n- Respect for free speech should be upheld as a commons to protect its longevity and usefulness.\n- In a highly partisan society, invoking principles alone may not be sufficient to rally support.\n\nKey questions:\n- Have the Harvard students thought through the potential consequences of inviting controversial speakers to their school?\n- How can free speech be defended without drawing from the commons too quickly?\n- Can principles still rally support in a highly partisan society, and if not, what can be done to bridge the divide?"
