    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- The author has been playing a game called Micras, which involves simulating countries and politics, for over thirteen years.\n- Playing Micras has taught the author about leadership, manipulation of consensus reality, and the importance of being nice.\n- Conworlding, or creating fictional worlds, is also a big part of Micras.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Large organizations tend to have a position that controls everything from behind the scenes but doesn't have to cope with the appearance of power.\n- Many people optimize for appearance, so it's easy to strike compromises that give everyone what they want.\n- It's important to be nice because the people you bully or harass may end up becoming influential in the future.\n\nKey questions:\n- If you were a society, what kind of society would you be?\n- How can we prepare young people better for leadership positions?\n- What are the implications of manipulating consensus reality in the real world?"
