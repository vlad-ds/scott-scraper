    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Little Soldiers is a book by Lenora Chu about the Chinese education system.\n- This post is a review of Dormin111\u2019s review of Little Soldiers.\n- The author describes her experiences in a top preschool in China and what she learned about the Chinese education system.\n- Chinese education system emphasizes discipline over creativity and independence.\n- Some people argue that the Prussian model of education used in the US is outdated and unsuited for the modern workforce.\n- The US education system is blamed for suppressing natural motivation in students.\n- Early factory workers lacked \"discipline capital\" like punctuality, sobriety, reliability, docility, and pliability\n- Mill workers in the Global South, including Japan, were described as idling, loitering, or socializing during work hours\n- US parenting and schooling seem to be getting less authoritarian over time\n- Preschools improve life outcomes such as graduation rates, crime rates, and employment\n- The Polgar strategy involves exposing children to out-of-distribution experiences without using force\n\nKey learnings:\n- The Chinese education system emphasizes discipline, obedience, and memorization over creativity and independence.\n- US education is criticized for its focus on homework, standardized testing, and competition.\n- There is no clear evidence to support the claim that extreme cultivation of discipline vs. laissez-faire childrearing affects long-term outcomes like self-control.\n- Lack of discipline capital among early factory workers hindered their adaptation to industrial work habits\n- Perceptions of chaotic and disorderly mill workers may have been due to early workers' preference for autonomous work arrangements\n- US parenting and schooling have become less authoritarian, yet children have become better behaved over time\n- Preschools may teach children discipline that improves their life outcomes\n- The Polgar strategy involves interesting children in a topic so avidly that they voluntarily study it at intense levels\n\nKey questions:\n- What qualities of the Chinese culture contribute to the emphasis on discipline in their education system?\n- Are there similar extreme versions of other education systems that can be compared to the Chinese one?\n- Can the Chinese education system be adapted to other cultures without suppressing natural motivation in students?\n- Which historical culture had the most authoritarian-instillment-of-virtue-focused approach to child-rearing?\n- What causes children to become more risk-averse over time?\n- Why are entrepreneurs decreasing in number and why are more top students choosing to work for a boss at a big bank?\n"
