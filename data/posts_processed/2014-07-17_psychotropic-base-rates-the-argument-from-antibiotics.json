    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- The antiprotozoal drug suramin has shown potential as a treatment for autism based on a cell danger response model of the condition.\n- Antibiotics, antiprotozoals, and antitubercular drugs have been found to have positive psychiatric effects.\n- The brain is easy to chemically disrupt, and random chemicals often change mental processes in important ways.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Antibiotics and other drugs not designed with psychiatry in mind could have unintended positive or negative effects on mental health.\n- Psychiatric treatments can come from unexpected sources.\n\nKey questions:\n- Is it merely coincidence that antibiotics and antiprotozoals have psychiatric effects, or is there an underlying reason?\n- Are there other drugs not traditionally used for psychiatric treatment that could have positive effects on mental health?\n- What other unexpected sources could potential psychiatric treatments be drawn from?"
