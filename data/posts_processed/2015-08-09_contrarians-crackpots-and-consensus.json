    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Gary Taubes' ideas on low-carb diets to solve obesity haven't fared well but some supporting points have been accepted.\n- Taubes' ideas were not perfectly novel or perfectly well-known in the 1990s and there was much disagreement at different levels of the scientific community.\n- Science journalism and political influence can affect the dissemination of scientific ideas.\n- Virtuous contrarians such as Irving Kirsch, Judith Rich Harris, and Nick Bostrom are received more quietly than crackpots.\n- People outside the field can offer fresh perspectives, identify new ideas and create new narratives.\n- People who overshoot and challenge the field where it is right can get caught in the trap and lose credibility.\n- Even when contrarians win, they lose as they will be remembered as partisans of crazy false ideas.\n- Contrarians can make contributions by calling attention to certain results in the field.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Scientific consensus isn't a monolith, but rather varies at each level of the scientific pyramid.\n- Disagreement among scientists does not imply that each viewpoint is equally valid.\n- Contrarian ideas from virtuous individuals may be worth considering.\n- People outside the field who offer fresh perspectives can add value to a field, but they need to be careful not to oversimplify or go too far in their claims.\n- Calling attention to certain results in the field is a valuable contribution, but it needs to be done without attacking the existing paradigm.\n\nKey questions:\n- How does enemy action affect the dissemination of scientific ideas?\n- Is there a way to distinguish virtuous contrarians from crackpots?\n- How or why are contrarian ideas from some individuals received more quietly?\n- What role do contrarians play in scientific progress?\n- How can contrarians contribute to a field without being seen as partisans of crazy false ideas?\n- Can contrarians win without losing in the end?\n"
