    "summary": "Key Ideas:\n- Utilitarianism requires a complicated superstructure of meta-rules that can't be derived from first principles.\n- Moral intuitions can override utilitarianism, making it less objective.\n- A consequentialist maxim of \"Maximize the world\u2019s resemblance to W\" is a substitute for universal consequentialism.\n- Platonic contracts are hypothetical contracts that could exist if there were perfect coordination and no loopholes, and following them could lead to better social cohesion.\n\nKey Learnings:\n- Grounding morality in something objective is difficult, and different approaches have their respective drawbacks.\n- Moral intuitions can override philosophical frameworks, like utilitarianism.\n- Platonic contracts can be a template for moral principles.\n\nKey Questions:\n- Can objective morality exist, or are we always just following our own desires and moral intuitions?\n- Are Platonic contracts a viable foundation for moral principles?\n- Can we reconcile the tension between moral intuitions and philosophical frameworks?"
