    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- The rationalist community now has a community center at La Renaissance Cafe in Berkeley managed by Sarah and in need of financial assistance.\n- The author may move SSC meetups to the community center.\n\nKey learnings:\n- There is a new study arguing that adult human neurogenesis does exist after all, which contradicts a previous study cited in a post.\n- Science in certain fields may have flimsy foundations and should be approached with caution.\n\nKey questions:\n- How can people assist with the financial needs of the community center?\n- How can the contradictory studies on adult human neurogenesis be reconciled?"
