    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Meditating can reduce the need for sleep, but you need to meditate for about two hours daily to experience benefits.\n- Olympic bronze medalists are happier than silver medalists, despite being placed lower.\n- Belief in Hell can lead to moral behavior, albeit at the cost of subjective well-being and life satisfaction.\n- Contrary to popular advice, Singapore's education system emphasizes drilling, mastery of specific procedures, and less classroom discussion.\n- People who drink skim or low-fat milk can end up fatter than those who drink whole milk.\n- Scientists have discovered a rational basis for the Civil War myth of the Angel's Glow.\n- To combat mental illness, psychiatrists can only go a small part of the way and should be complemented by support, education, and healthy habits.\n\nKey learnings\n- The benefits of meditating come at a cost of dedicating at least two hours daily.\n- The significance of Olympic medalists affects happiness, depending on their medal.\n- The belief in Hell can have trade-offs, such as moral behavior vs. subjective well-being.\n- Archaic educational techniques and drilling can be effective in countries like Singapore.\n- Drinking whole milk can be healthier than skim or low-fat milk.\n- Mental health treatment should involve more than seeking psychiatric help.\n\nKey questions\n- How can we balance our happiness with our belief systems?\n- Does single-sex education genuinely perform more poorly than co-ed schools?\n- What other superstitions contain a genuine scientific explanation?\n- Should we approach the ivory trade in elephants in any other way? \n- How can mental health treatment approach patients beyond just psychiatric help?"
