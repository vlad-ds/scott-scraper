    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Mick Mulvaney said the richest 20% pay 84-95% of income taxes, while the poorest 80% pay between 90-280 billion.\n- Halving income taxes for the bottom 80% of the population could be a cost-neutral alternative for the GOP bill.\n- CEOs are unlikely to invest the tax cut in cool economic-growth boosting stuff that will spur the economy, according to the Forbes.\n- The proposed tax bill may not benefit poor and middle-class people, but incentivizes CEOs and stakeholders and costs the government money.\n- Giving poor and middle-class people more money is a more direct and more effective way to help them than spending the money on complicated government programs or corporate tax cuts.\n\nKey learnings\n- The proposed tax bill is not an effective way to uplift poor and middle-class people's lives.\n- Giving more money to poor and middle-class people is a more direct, effective, and cost-efficient alternative.\n- The current tax bill incentivizes corporations and stakeholders.\n\nKey questions \n- Is there any reason to prefer the GOP plan to halve income taxes for the bottom 80% of the population?\n- Will the tax bill turbo-charge the economy and positively impact poor and middle-class people?\n- Should the government spend the tax money on social welfare programs, expanding EITC, or cutting personal income taxes in lower brackets instead of the current proposal?"
