    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Animals' intelligence is correlated with their number of cortical neurons.\n- A scale can be created to place animals and humans on the same ladder using this correlation.\n- Different animal rights people have different ideas for calculating the moral value of animals.\n\nKey learnings\n- People's intuitive ideas about the moral value of animals corresponded with their cortical neuron count.\n- The survey results on how many animals it takes to have the same moral worth as a human are pretty similar to the neuron count of animals needed to equal one human.\n\nKey questions\n- How can a more representative population be surveyed to validate the results?\n- Do different species of animal have similar moral values?\n- Are there more accurate ways of calculating animal intelligence to determine their moral worth?"
