    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- A study found that about 40% of Americans support some form of eugenics, despite the belief that moral opposition to eugenics was universal.\n- The lack of support for eugenics was primarily due to concerns about effectiveness rather than moral opposition.\n- The author uses a metaphor of norm enforcement through coordinated retaliation to explain why there is an opposition norm to eugenics.\n- The author notes that opposition norms can shift through well-coordinated opposition waging a battle leading to new coordination norms.\n\nKey learnings:\n- There is not as much universal opposition to eugenics as previously thought.\n- Opposition norms to certain beliefs can be formed through coordinated retaliation leading to new coordination norms.\n- The same coordination shift happened in the battle for gay rights.\n\nKey questions:\n- How can a structural opposition to censorship be created when opponents can coordinate to suppress ideas?\n- Can the same coordination shift happen with other contested ideas?"
