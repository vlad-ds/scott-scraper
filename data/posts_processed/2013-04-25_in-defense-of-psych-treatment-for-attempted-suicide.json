    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- The author explores the idea of whether or not suicidal individuals should be hospitalized, arguing that most attempters rarely make rational decisions\n- The author discusses how mental illness and other factors can contribute to suicidal ideation and suicide attempts\n- The author analyzes data on suicide attempts and completed suicides, including the fact that most attempters do not go on to complete suicide\n- There are objections to sending people who attempt suicide to psychiatric hospitals.\n- Mental hospitals for such people are not like the one in One Flew Over The Cuckoo\u2019s Nest.\n- The average suicidal person's length of stay in a mental health ward is 72 hours.\n- This helps because connecting people with someone who can help or refer them to a therapist can make a big deal.\n- Specific drugs such as lithium have been shown to be a particularly good way to cut future suicide rates.\n- Suicides can be rational, but the vast majority of cases are impulsive or done in a state where there is a lack of full decision-making capacity.\n- The psychiatric system can be of huge help in the latter group.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Suicide attempts are often not made by rational individuals\n- Mental illness plays a significant role in suicidal ideation and suicide attempts\n- A significant percentage of suicide attempters change their minds and do not go on to complete suicide\n- Sending people who attempt suicide to psychiatric hospitals is not a punishment.\n- The average length of stay for a suicidal person in a mental health ward is 72 hours, which is mostly enough for evaluation and medication.\n- Mental diseases can increase the risk of suicide by ten times, so psychiatric care is highly effective.\n\nKey questions:\n- Should suicidal individuals be legally allowed to end their lives with euthanasia?\n- What is the role of mental illness in suicide attempts?\n- How can society better address the issue of suicide prevention and support for those struggling with mental illness?\n- Is institutionalizing someone who attempts suicide a betrayal of their autonomy?\n- Are there alternatives to institutionalization that could be effective?\n- How can we determine whether a suicidal person is in a state of mental disease or has made a reasoned decision to end their life?\n"
