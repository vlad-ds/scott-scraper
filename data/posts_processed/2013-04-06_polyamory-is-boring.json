    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- The author, Scott, used to think that polyamory was bizarre and strange, but now believes it to be a normal way of life.\n- Scott cites his experience of living with his polyamorous friend Hannah and her partner Mike, defending them against criticisms of their lifestyle.\n- He argues that jealousy is not a significant issue in polyamorous relationships, instead emphasizing the importance of compersion.\n- Scott suggests that polyamory is not just about sex, but rather focuses on the importance of having multiple meaningful relationships."
