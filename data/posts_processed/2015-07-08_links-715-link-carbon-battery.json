    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Schools appear to be assigning harder reading material at an earlier age.\n- A study from Finland demonstrates that there is a link between crime and IQ\n- Giving poor families money improves children\u2019s outcomes considerably.\n- For-profit colleges tend to leave most of their graduates unemployed or working below-poverty-line jobs.\n- China increased years of required schooling, leading to new research showing that the labor market return to another year of schooling is very small.\n\nKey learnings\n- The US\u2019 private health system is no more or less expected to spend than Europe\u2019s public health systems.\n- Genetic factors and childhood trauma both independently increase people\u2019s risk for psychosis.\n\nKey questions\n- Does the black-white outcome difference study mean that genetics or discrimination-based explanations are invalid?\n- Could volunteering become illegal after a class action lawsuit against AOL?\n- Does US healthcare spending truly result in worse outcomes than Europe's public healthcare?\n- How large of an effect does giving poor families money have on long-term outcomes?"
