    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- There are many beliefs or movements that can be analogized to a religion.\n- One critique is that \u201creligion\u201d is a broad enough category that anything can be mapped onto it.\n- The difference between \u201creligion\u201d and \u201cculture\u201d is quite vague.\n- Communities or cultures have values in common, rules, heroes, and hierarchies, and they shun people who don't fit in.\n- Calling communities/cultures \u201creligions\u201d is unfair and harms discussions.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Environmentalism and social justice communities are often compared to religions and seen as more religious than gun control and pro-choice communities.\n- Values in common, rules, heroes, and hierarchies are features of communities, which may share similarities with organized religions.\n- Communities and cultures play an epistemological function, meaning that evidence challenging their core beliefs may be taken as an attack on members' identities.\n\nKey questions:\n- Is religion becoming a catch-all term for communities/cultures with shared beliefs and values?\n- How can communities/cultures effectively engage with opinions that challenge their core beliefs?\n- What are some dangers of belonging to communities/cultures with shared values, rules, and heroes and shunning those who don't fit in?"
