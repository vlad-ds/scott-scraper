    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Evolutionarily conserved, hormone-regulated nonapeptide systems are involved in mediation of detection and avoidance of out-groups, and response to in-groups and facilitation of in-group responses across vertebrate species.\n- Pro-Brexit voters are less likely to trust experts in various fields.\n- YouGov poll reveals that leave voters prefer their steaks well-done while remain voters prefer theirs rare.\n- The youngest people in France are more likely to support nationalist candidate Marine Le Pen than older generations.\n- Study finds that IQ is more important for standardized test scores, while personality traits are more important for grades.\n- Study by American Council on Science and Health ranks news outlets according to which ones have the most compelling science reporting.\n- Government is doing more of its work through private partnerships, nonprofits, and local administrations.\n- Proxy-administered government activities might be less efficient than openly doing government activities with real federal employees.\n- The electorate wants both more stuff and smaller government.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Comparative investigations of out-group avoidance and in-group bias are necessary for understanding evolution of social behavior across species.\n- Brexiteers' mistrust extends to various experts and spans beyond politics.\n- There might be a correlation between steak-preferences and media propaganda.\n- Younger French generations are more susceptible to nationalist ideals.\n- There is a difference in the importance of different personality traits when it comes to test scores and grades.\n- American Council on Science and Health claims that major differences exist in mainstream, respectable news reporting regarding science.\n- Politicians are satisfying both preferences by making government activities less visible and more proxy-administered.\n\nKey questions:\n- What could be causing the mistrust from Brexiteers towards various experts in different fields?\n- How trustworthy is the YouGov poll?\n- Is there a correlation between mass media propaganda and the way we perceive food?\n- What is the reason for the younger French generations' susceptibility to nationalist ideals?\n- What other tests can be used to measure downsides of police militarization?\n- How much can the media be trusted when it comes to scientific reporting?\n- Is it possible to satisfy the electorate's preferences while still efficiently executing government activities?\n- How can we balance the desire for more resources with the desire for smaller government?\n"
