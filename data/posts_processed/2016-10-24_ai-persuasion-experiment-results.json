    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- The author conducted an experiment to determine if online essays could change people's minds about complicated, controversial topics.\n- The experiment showed that people's concerns regarding AI risk increased by an average of 0.5 points on a ten-point scale after reading the essays.\n- The five different essays did not have significant differences in their ability to persuade people, and the level of knowledge about AI risk did not significantly alter the results.\n- Mostly, the effects of the experiment persist after a month, and any essay can be used to persuade people.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Essays can change people's minds about complicated, controversial topics.\n- People's existing knowledge of a topic may not affect their susceptibility to change their minds.\n- There is a modest but useful effect of trying to persuade people.\n\nKey questions:\n- Can online essays change people's minds about other complicated, controversial topics?\n- What are the features of an essay that can or cannot change people's minds?\n- Can we determine who is easiest or hardest to persuade with a certain type of essay?"
