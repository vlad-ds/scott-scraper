    "summary": "Key ideas: \n- Many early psychedelic researchers went from being brilliant scientists to having styles of thought ranging from original to downright crazy. \n- Possibilities for this include: these researchers were already a bit weird to begin with, psychedelics expand one's interest in the study of consciousness and the universe, or psychedelics have a direct pharmacological effect on personality that causes people to be more open to unusual ideas. \n\nKey learnings:\n- A single dose of psilocybin can permanently increase the personality dimension of Openness To Experience. \n- It is possible that psychedelics have a direct pharmacological effect on personality. \n- Early psychedelicists could be a natural experiment giving data on the effects of long-term psychedelic use.\n\nKey questions:\n- Why did early psychedelic researchers become \"weird\"? \n- What effect do psychedelics have on personality? \n- What are the long-term effects of psychedelic use?"
