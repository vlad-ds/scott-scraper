    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Winners of the adversarial collaboration contest are announced\n- The collaboration on education garnered the most popular vote, while the author chose the collaboration on transgender children as the winner\n- The author provides brief critiques of all the collaborations, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each\n- The author asked the collaborators to send reports on their process, which are briefly summarized\n- The collaboration between Scott and TW involved a lot of debate and integration of different fields of education research.\n- Adversarial collaborations can work best when there is high levels of trust beforehand and a clear division of labor.\n- The collaboration between JohnBuridan and ChristianFlanery involved constant unceasing debate, but in a context of high levels of trust.\n- Mark W's initial position was that herd immunity is a compelling government interest, and that it is well within the power of a reasonable government to implement a mandatory policy in order to achieve this end.\n- Most of the debate between Mark W and Mark Davis was about whether vaccines can lead to autoimmunity.\n- Some of the adversarial collaborations failed to solve the main disagreements between the two parties and instead shifted to a less contentious topic.\n- Almost no one changed their mind on the overall issue, but everyone moderated their opinion at least a little.\n- Pseudoscience topics that are mostly discredited have a risk of being legitimized through the adversarial collaboration format.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Adversarial collaborations can be a useful thinking tool and a great learning experience\n- It takes a lot of time and willingness to talk about the entire topic, not just pet issues\n- Disagreements can often boil down to differing priorities and interpretations of object-level facts\n- Making sense of classroom questions is going to involve more fuzziness and wandering than for certain other questions.\n- Establishing high levels of trust and designing a method and framework are essential for effective adversarial collaborations.\n- The burden of proof usually lies with the side opposing a policy.\n- Collaborators should choose titles and stake out specific claims from the start.\n- Concluding with whether conditions were met or not is an important element.\n- A third, impartial moderator can help resolve disagreements.\n- Collaboration participants should be open-minded and agreeable.\n\nKey questions:\n- What were the biggest weaknesses of the winning collaboration on transgender children?\n- Should America have mandatory childhood vaccinations?\n- Are Muslim countries less likely to be democratic than other countries?\n- Are adversarial collaborations more effective when opponents are pitted against each other or when cooperation is promoted?\n- What are the ethical implications of opposing vaccination on the grounds that it's necessary to experience disease exposure in order to protect against autoimmunity?\n- What changes could be made for future adversarial collaborations?\n- How can the adversarial collaboration format avoid legitimizing pseudoscience theories?\n- What is the importance of having an impartial moderator in an adversarial collaboration?\n"
