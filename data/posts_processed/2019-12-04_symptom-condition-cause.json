    "summary": "Key Ideas:\n- Psychiatric diagnoses don\u2019t have to match underlying root causes.\n- \u201cConditions\u201d which nobody has yet matched with a biological process gets dubbed as syndromes.\n- Depression is different than a condition like stroke because we don\u2019t yet know what biological process it corresponds to.\n\nKey Learnings:\n- Psychiatric disorders will mostly turn out to be computational conditions.\n- Research that treats depression as a single condition might or might not work.\n\nKey Questions:\n- What is pulmonary edema?\n- What\u2019s the technical philosophy-of-medicine term for condition?\n- Are psychiatric disorders better explained by regional stories, biochemical stories, computational explanations or other?"
