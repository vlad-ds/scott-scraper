    "summary": "Key ideas\n- In high school, the author was scared of people asking him to do things with them and avoided these conversations by making excuses and mumbled half-answers.\n- At work, the author handles such situations by honestly telling that he doesn't like doing things, has no friends, and loves doing nothing.\n- This countersignaling behavior has made the author popular among co-workers who assume him to have a super fascinating life that he's not telling.\n- Countersignaling is a form of signaling one's value by showing that they are too valuable to need to signal.\n\nKey learnings\n- Countersignaling works when the underlying value is there, but it can backfire if the underlying value is not present.\n- The appropriate level of signaling/countersignaling depends on the situation and audience.\n\nKey questions\n- How can one develop underlying value such that they can countersignal effectively?\n- How can one identify the appropriate level of signaling/countersignaling in a given situation?\n- What are some situations where countersignaling can backfire, and how can one avoid it?"
