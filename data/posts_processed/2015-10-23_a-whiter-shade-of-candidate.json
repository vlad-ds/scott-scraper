    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Although most media outlets suggest that Donald Trump's supporters are primarily white, data suggests that they are about as diverse as any other Republican candidate's supporters.\n- Bernie Sanders has significantly less support from nonwhite voters than Hillary Clinton, while Donald Trump actually does surprisingly well with some nonwhite demographics.\n- The current election aligns the splits within the Democratic Party, with Sanders' supporters generally being wealthy and educated while Clinton's support comes from the social justice activists, nonwhites, and poor.\n\nKey learnings\n- Polling data suggests that Donald Trump's supporters are just as diverse as any other Republican candidate's, disproving the media's narrative that Trump has a special appeal to white voters.\n- Bernie Sanders' strength among white voters is not reflected among nonwhite voters, with Clinton having overwhelming support from this demographic.\n- It's important to use precise definitions when categorizing people by race or ethnicity, as \"white\" can have different meanings in different contexts.\n \nKey questions\n- What will happen to the Democratic Party if Sanders wins the nomination but struggles to gain support from nonwhite voters in the general election?\n- To what extent do media narratives affect public perceptions of political candidates, and how much weight should be given to polling data?\n- Is there a correlation between a candidate's \"weirdness\" or lack of mainstream appeal and their level of support from nonwhite voters?"
