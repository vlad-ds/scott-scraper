    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- The Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God emphasized the importance of the Commandments to such an extent that on some days communication was only conducted in sign language.\n- In the 1960s, ads in kids\u2019 magazines offered to sell pet monkeys for $19.95.\n- Gwern discusses hard-to-notice ways that things have improved since the late 1980s.\n- The Portuguese conqueror Afonso de Albuquerque was able to control trade on the Indian Ocean by taking over Asian coastline.\n- The McLibel Case cast international attention on the UK\u2019s strict and freedom-of-speech-threatening libel laws.\n- 538 reveals which states have produced the most presidential nominees.\n- The burned house horizon is the area in Europe where people from 7000 BC to 2000 BC often deliberately burned their own houses down for no apparent reason.\n- A new meta-analysis out of Stanford shows that Alcoholics Anonymous is the most effective path to abstinence; however, its effectiveness does not necessarily mean it is the right solution for everyone.\n- Silly rules play a useful role by spreading information about which of your neighbors comply with taboos and how often violations get punished.\n- Stephen Wolfram argues that we may have a path to the fundamental theory of physics.\n- Contrary to common assessment, Cuba\u2019s statistics for lowering infant mortality and increasing longevity overstate their achievements.\n- Health economics experts rank different countries\u2019 health care systems in a bracket-style tournament.\n- A survey indicates that 22% of MTurk users don't read the questions before answering.\n- The Uncensored Library on Minecraft has all the information banned by repressive governments.\n- A new microbe has been discovered that can stop mosquitoes from being infected by malaria.\n- An analysis of the Japanese auto industry in the 70s compared to the US auto industry.\n- DrugsAnd.Me is a good source for learning about recreational drugs.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Many improvements to everyday objects and technology have been made since the 1980s, some big and some small.\n- People from the Portguese conqueror Afonso de Albuquerque to the so-called Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God have sought to exert control over specific areas through unique methods.\n- Alcoholics Anonymous is the most effective option for achieving abstinence, but it may not work for everyone.\n- Although Cuba has been praised for its achievements in lowering infant mortality and increasing longevity, their statistics overstate their success due to data manipulation.\n- Peer review is necessary to enforce a minimum standard of honesty in scientific literature.\n- Rich Democratic donors do not drag their party towards the right on economic issues.\n- Regulations on building affordable housing make it more expensive to build affordable housing than luxury housing.\n- Romney's policy on homeless shelters reduced the number of new people staying in the shelters.\n\nKey questions:\n- How did Afonso de Albuquerque gain control of Asian coastline to control trade on the Indian Ocean?\n- Did the burned house horizon have any religious connotations or purposes?\n- What are some other equally-structured programs that may be equally or more effective as Alcoholics Anonymous?\n- What alternatives are there to achieving the achievements made by Cuba in areas such as infant mortality and longevity that do not involve data manipulation?\n- What is the significance of the shipularity trend and how might it apply to AI capabilities?\n- What was the Japanese advantage that allowed them to produce better cars than the US in the 70s?\n- How can the newly-discovered microbe be used to help eradicate malaria?\n- What implications does the Scunthorpe Problem have for censorship and spam filters?\n"
