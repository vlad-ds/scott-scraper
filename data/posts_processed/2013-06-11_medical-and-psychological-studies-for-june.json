    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Scientists argue that the benefits of exposure to ultraviolet light may be greater than the risks.\n- Probiotics can affect brain function and emotion-processing in humans and mice without normal gut bacteria exhibit autism-like behavior.\n- Gut bacteria can affect obesity levels in mice and a mother\u2019s health can program a fetus to metabolize fat differently.\n- A new molecule may replicate ketamine\u2019s antidepressant effects without its side effects.\n- Peer review may be useless since peer reviewers reject articles they previously accepted.\n- A study finds that 75% of lesbians are obese, and researchers want to know why.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Exposure to ultraviolet light may not be as harmful as previously thought.\n- Gut bacteria can affect various parts of the body such as the brain and weight.\n- Genetic differences in people\u2019s oxytocin receptors may influence their relationship status.\n- Potential implications for universal genetic information and people's right to ask their partner about it.\n\nKey questions:\n- How can we help people take scientific advice more seriously during stressful situations?\n- Do people have the right to know their prospective partner's genetic information?\n- Why are 75% of lesbians obese and not other sexual orientations?\n- How can we improve the peer-review process to make it more useful?"
