    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Study shows that banning bottled water on campuses doesn't reduce plastic consumption, but makes students switch to bottled soda with no improvement in health.\n- Mexican drug cartels have significantly decreased in activity, but scientists believe that this could be due to the break down of cartels into smaller, more disorganized groups\n- A systematic review of all 55 medical conditions discovered that there are certain points of the year where risks of specific conditions may increase.\n- A new study shows that colleges who provided programs that taught women how to avoid rape saw a 50% reduction in risk.\n- An uncommon allele of the MAO-A gene may increase the risk of criminal behavior in people by sevenfold, making it the strongest gene-crime link to date \n\nKey learnings\n- The US may be able to replicate Scandinavia's low poverty rate with a high standard of living and absolute poverty if executed correctly.\n- Swedes living in the US and in Sweden share similar poverty rates.\n- College professors in California may face punishment for committing 'microaggressions', including simply saying that \"I believe the most qualified person should get the job\".\n- 66% of replication attempts in economics studies fail to completely replicate the original finding.\n \nKey questions\n- Do probiotics help with anxiety?\n- How does an IQ test affect job interviews and how does it fit into the Griggs vs. US ruling?\n- Could the US lower crime rates by identifying people with the MAO-A gene?\n- Can industries that feature multiracial employees resolve racial gaps in salaries by changing audience perception?\n- What does Iceland have to teach the US about fiscal austerity? \n"
