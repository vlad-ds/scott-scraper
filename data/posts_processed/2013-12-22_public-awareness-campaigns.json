    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Public awareness campaigns have a long history of failure as well as success.\n- Research on anti-rape campaigns aimed at men has zero evidence of effectiveness.\n- Some successful public awareness campaigns include MADD\u2019s campaign against drunk driving and seatbelt awareness campaigns.\n- Stigmatizing campaigns can be counterproductive and cause resentment in those who are forced to endure them.\n- The author believes it is difficult to predict the success or failure of future public awareness campaigns.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Tobacco and anti-drunk driving campaigns work using very graphic images of bad outcomes.\n- Employing stigma can be successful, but not always.\n- Captive audiences, as in DARE and sex education programs, are more likely to be counterproductive.\n\nKey questions:\n- Why do some public awareness campaigns work and others fail?\n- What types of negative feelings from campaigns are more likely to be counterproductive?\n- Can promoting public awareness campaigns lead to resentment in the groups they target?\n- How can the success or failure of future public awareness campaigns be predicted?"
