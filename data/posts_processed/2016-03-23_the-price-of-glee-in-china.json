    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Noah Smith argues that globalization was a net harm to working class people in rich countries while Sumner sees it as a benefit to poorer nations.\n- Easterlin\u2019s Paradox suggests that national income does not increase national happiness.\n- There is cultural variation in happiness-income relationship.\n- If development does not increase happiness, what should be done with this knowledge?\n- There are three ways to go from here: abandon consequentialism, switch to a consequentialism based on non-subjective things, or switch to preference utilitarianism.\n- Economic progress may not change happiness yet. \n\nKey Learnings:\n- Globalization benefits developing nations far more than developed nations.\n- National income does not necessarily impact national happiness.\n- Happiness can vary depending on culture.\n- The impact of development on happiness is unclear.\n- Consequentialism, which bases actions on the outcome they lead to, is difficult when it comes to the impact of development.\n- Economic progress may not necessarily change happiness.\n\nKey Questions:\n- Does globalization hurt working-class people in rich countries?\n- Can national income impact national happiness?\n- Do economic development and industrialization lead to happiness?\n- Should we abandon consequentialism?\n- Can a preference utilitarianism approach solve the issue of economic development? \n- Can economic progress change happiness?"
