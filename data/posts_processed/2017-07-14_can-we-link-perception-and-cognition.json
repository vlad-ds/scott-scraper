    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Survey results show a correlation between high rates of perceptual ambiguity and being perceived as weirder or less-functioning. \n- The author wonders if cognitive differences in reasoning could be measured by studying differences in perception, given the Bayesian brain hypothesis\n- The author aims to conduct more studies on illusions, both variations of the same illusion and different illusions that have underlying similarity.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Illusion perception may be related to some cognitive process, which mirrors the claims of the Bayesian brain hypothesis.\n- There may be cognitive factors besides personality traits that impact how individuals perceive illusions.\n\nKey questions:\n- Could perception of certain illusions predict responses to certain cognitive biases?\n- Could those responses predict things like philosophical stance, applying traditional or innovative approaches, or whether someone thinks people are good or evil?"
