    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Bubuti system sounds cute, but in reality leads to economic problems\n- Cool maps dividing the US into economic regions based on the movement of dollar bills\n- Microryza is a Kickstarter for scientific studies that could help fund studies on alternative medicine\n- Gender studies find that both men and women rate abstracts with male author names higher\n- North Korea is both tragic and hilarious to people on Reddit\n- Nuclear power has saved 1.8 million lives over the last half-century\n- Sleep deprivation in pill form could help treat depression\n- Moderate drinking may not have the positive effect on health that had been thought\n\nKey learnings:\n- Economic equality is not just as simple as making everyone share property with each other\n- Science Heroes has a new ranking system that ranks scientists by how many lives they saved\n- Nuclear power actually saves lives\n- Sleep deprivation can help treat depression, but it may not be practical\n- Drinking may not have as positive effect on health as previously thought\n\nKey questions:\n- Can Microryza revolutionize the funding of scientific studies?\n- Why do women rate abstracts with male names higher than those of female authors?\n- Should nuclear power be shut down based on the risk of accidents or should it be embraced for the number of lives it saves?\n- Can sleep deprivation in pill form actually be effective at treating depression?\n- What other factors, besides moderate drinking, impact lifetime health the most?"
