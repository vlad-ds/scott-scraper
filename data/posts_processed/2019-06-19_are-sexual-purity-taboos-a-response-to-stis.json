    "summary": "Key ideas\n- STIs were a significant problem in the past.\n- Sexual purity taboos include marrying a virgin, and marrying a widow is okay, and marrying a former prostitute is beyond the pale.\n- Purity taboos derived from paternity issues and STIs.\n- There were relatively weak prohibitions on homosexual intercourse, as long as there was a limited role versatility, during the period when STIs were rare and weak.\n\nKey learnings\n- There is a plausible relationship between STIs and cultural evolution of taboos against promiscuity and homosexuality.\n- The evidence of the relationship between STIs and cultural evolution of taboos against promiscuity and homosexuality is circumstantial.\n \nKey questions\n- Did cultural evolution create sexual purity taboos to prevent the spread of STIs?\n- What about taboos on homosexuality?\n- How did taboos change as STIs became more common?\n- Were there earlier STIs that might have caused the taboos?"
