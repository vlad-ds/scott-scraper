    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Cheap-O Psychiatry is a theoretical, highly affordable online mental health practice with a self-explanatory name and a focus on delivering efficient and effective treatment to patients at a fraction of the normal cost. \n- The practice makes its clinicians available for 15-minute Skype consultations in lieu of costlier, in-person visits, but provides a comprehensive collection of self-help resources on topics like sleep habits, nutrition, and CBT therapy on its website. \n\nKey learnings\n- Cheap-O Psychiatry suggests that affordable healthcare delivery is possible, even within the current, deeply faulted system that frequently places heavy financial burdens on patients. \n- To achieve this goal, practices need to be lean, efficient, and meticulous about avoiding unnecessary expenses, while also maintaining the highest standards of clinical care quality. \n\nKey questions\n- Why is high-quality affordable healthcare so rare and elusive, and what would it take to alter the industry in a way that made it more widely accessible to patients anywhere in America? \n- If entrepreneurs like the author created more experiments like Cheap-O Psychiatry, where do they go from here? What are the next steps?"
