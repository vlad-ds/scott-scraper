    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- A survey found that 90% of polyamorous people identified as Caucasian, and people of color feel excluded and objectified in polyamorous spaces.\n- The article argues that this is due to a standard of whiteness that erases people of color.\n- The author points out that black people are underrepresented in many weird subculturey nonconformist things, not just polyamory. \n\nKey learnings:\n- Black people are likely to be underrepresented in a lot of weird subculturey nonconformist things due to factors like affluence, Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, and education.\n- The idea of low minority representation is often used as an accusation of racism or intolerance, making it easier for underrepresented groups to be targeted.\n\nKey questions:\n- Why do weird subculturey nonconformist things tend to draw from the upper middle class?\n- How can we address the underrepresentation of black people and other marginalized groups in nonconformist communities? \n- Why do some people use low minority representation to accuse groups of racism or intolerance?"
