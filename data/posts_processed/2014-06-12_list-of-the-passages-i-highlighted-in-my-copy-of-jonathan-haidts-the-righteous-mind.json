    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Witchcraft beliefs are common across cultures and are used to order societies rather than to explain the universe.\n- Piaget's findings suggest that children learn best through play and self-discovery rather than through adult explanations.\n- Communes that demand more sacrifices from members tend to last longer if they are religious, but not if they are secular.\n- Religious groups tend to generate more social capital than secular groups, benefiting outsiders.\n- Political polarization in the US can be partly attributed to the realignment of the South with the Republican party after the Civil Rights Act was signed in 1964.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Markets that require high trust to function efficiently are often dominated by religiously bound ethnic groups.\n- Religion generates vast surpluses of social capital that spill over and benefit outsiders.\n- Moderates and conservatives are better at predicting how liberals and conservatives would respond to moral questions than liberals are.\n- Libertarians tend to score higher on openness to experience and lower on disgust sensitivity and conscientiousness than conservatives.\n\nKey questions:\n- Why do demands for sacrifice help religious communes last longer but not secular ones?\n- Can \"Sunday Assembly\" style groups generate the same effects as religious groups in generating social capital?\n- How can we reverse the trend of political polarization and increase cross-party friendships among Congressmen?\n- What are the implications of libertarians scoring lower on the Care foundation?"
