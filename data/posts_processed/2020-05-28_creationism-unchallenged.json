    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Responsible news organizations are faced with the challenge of reporting on stupid things without giving them too much publicity.\n- Studies have shown that the mainstream press has played a role in the dissemination of fake news.\n- There is a concern that being too aggressive in covering and debunking fake news might actually give it more attention.\n- The author draws a parallel between the coverage of creationism in the early 2000s and the coverage of modern-day fringe ideologies.\n\nKey learnings\n- Covering stupid things can result in wasted time and resources and take away from reporting on more important issues.\n- Legitimizing unethical practices to combat fringe ideologies may not be effective in the long run.\n\nKey questions\n- How can responsible news organizations strike a balance between reporting on stupid things and not giving them too much attention?\n- Should mainstream news outlets tone down their coverage of fringe ideologies to avoid signal-boosting them? \n- Is it worth using controversial tactics if it helps to combat anti-science ideologies, or is it just as useless as excessive media coverage of stupid things?"
