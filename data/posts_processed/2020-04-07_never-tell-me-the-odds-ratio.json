    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Odds ratios can be misleading in terms of the actual effect size of a treatment or intervention.\n- Chen's How Big is a Big Odds Ratio? Interpreting the Magnitudes of Odds Ratios in Epidemiological Studies, offers a way to convert odds ratios into effect sizes.\n- A quick heuristic for this conversion is to ignore prevalence and use [ln(odds ratio)]/1.81.\n\nKey learnings\n- Odds ratios should not be relied upon to gauge the magnitude of an effect.\n- Effect sizes are a better metric for comparing different studies or treatments.\n- A heuristic formula can be used to convert odds ratios into effect sizes.\n\nKey questions\n- What other measures can be used to accurately gauge the size of an effect?\n- Why is there still a reliance on odds ratios in reporting study results?\n- How can researchers ensure that their results accurately quantify the effects of a treatment or intervention?"
