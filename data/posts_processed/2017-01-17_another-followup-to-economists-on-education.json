    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Last month, Scott argued about the misrepresentation of economists' views on school vouchers in a news article.\n- He proposed an experiment to settle the disagreement about the article and offered a bet to some people who disagreed with him.\n- The experiment involved showing the article to random people and asking them if economists support or oppose privatizing education.\n- The results of two separate surveys showed that most people misinterpreted the article to mean that economists oppose privatization.\n- Scott won the bet and settled the disagreement.\n\nKey learnings\n- An article can mislead readers into thinking that it is conveying a consensus when it is not.\n- Empirical evidence can settle disagreements more decisively than arguments.\n- An experiment can provide an opportunity for people to test their beliefs.\n\nKey questions\n- How can readers avoid being misled by news articles that claim to convey a consensus of experts?\n- What are the limitations of using surveys to test people's comprehension of an article?\n- How can disagreements about the meaning of an article be settled more conclusively?"
