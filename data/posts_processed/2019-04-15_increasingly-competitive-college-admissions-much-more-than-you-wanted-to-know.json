    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Acceptance rates at top colleges have declined by about half over the past decade.\n- Pressure of getting into a good university may be leading to suicides at elite high schools.\n- There are more than enough non-selective colleges for everyone, but competition for competitive schools is increasing.\n- Early American colleges had simpler admission requirements and the students were mostly prepared for the coursework.\n- Harvard only accepted students who were fluent in Latin and Greek, which was shockingly common at the time.\n- In the late 19th century, there was a movement to standardize college admissions which led to the transition from making sure students were ready to rationing out scarce spots.\n- By the 1920s, top colleges switched from standardized testing to an easier-to-bias \"holistics admissions\" system that implemented quotas in the 1960s to limit the number of Jewish students.\n- Before the 20th century, becoming a doctor, lawyer, or college graduate was much more accessible and less regulated.\n- Despite the lack of gatekeeping measures or strict admission requirements, there was no oversupply of doctors or lawyers and salaries remained high.\n- The ease of entering these professions may have been due to the fact that the majority of Americans were farmers and didn't have many other career options.\n- In the mid-1900s, a combination of factors led to an increase in college attendance, including the GI Bill and the college loophole for avoiding the draft.\n- The rise of the college degree as a signal for intelligence, and the increased sorting of people by college selectivity, made knowledge worker jobs increasingly necessary to earn a living.\n- The number of US students applying to college has decreased over the past ten years, but admissions to top colleges have become much more competitive.\n- There is a perception of increased competition for college admissions.\n- Possible reasons for this include the increased number of applications per person, increased common knowledge of competition leading to more intense competition, and decreased reliance on hard-to-game metrics like the SAT.\n- Beyond college level, competition is intensifying in fields like medicine and law.\n- Admissions to top colleges, medical schools, and law schools have become more competitive over the years.\n- Until 1900, there was no competition for these places.\n- Increased competition in the past ten years might be due to the ease of applying to more colleges or because of students getting stuck in a high-competition equilibrium.\n- Going to a selective college as an undergraduate does not necessarily lead to a more lucrative career or a higher chance of admission to postgraduate education unless a person is from a disadvantaged background.\n- There is no good data about graduate schools, but prestigious graduate schools are almost an absolute requirement for becoming a professor in many fields.\n\nKey learnings:\n- The pressure of getting into a good university has risen, leading to increased competition for the same number of spots at competitive schools.\n- The rise of standardized testing and holistics admissions led to the implementation of quotas in the 1960s that limited the number of Jewish students at top colleges.\n- The lack of gatekeeping measures for professions like doctor or lawyer did not lead to an oversupply of professionals or a decline in salaries.\n- The college enrollment boom in the mid-1900s was driven by a complex interaction of factors, including the GI Bill and the college loophole for avoiding the draft.\n- The rise of the college degree as a signal for intelligence complements other changes in hiring practices, such as declining reliance on hunch-based methods.\n- Despite a recent decrease in the number of US students applying to college, admissions to top colleges have become much more competitive.\n- The online Common Application has doubled the number of applications sent to top colleges.\n- The reasons behind increasing competition in college admissions may be a combination of factors, including increased efforts by students and colleges to stand out, and increased sorting.\n- In fields like medicine, the number of applicants is increasing faster than the number of spots available.\n- Until the 1900s, getting into top colleges, medical schools, and law schools was not a problem because there was no competition.\n- Unless a person is disadvantaged, going to a more selective college does not necessarily lead to a more lucrative career or a higher chance of admission to postgraduate education.\n\nKey questions:\n- Have college admissions always been a big deal and how did college admissions become competitive?\n- Is academia more competitive now than in the past, and what's responsible for this?\n- Is freaking out about college admissions the correct course of action?\n- Why was there no oversupply of doctors or lawyers before gatekeeping measures were put in place?\n- What factors contributed to the decline in reliance on hunch-based hiring practices?\n- What role did the government's provision of supposedly-free college loans play in the rise of college attendance?\n- Why have college admissions to top schools become more competitive despite a decrease in the number of US students applying to college?\n- Could the increasing number of international students affect selectivity?\n- How much does the emphasis on extracurriculars affect college admissions?\n- Are funding cuts affecting the number of positions available at public universities?\n- How did the secular trend towards increasing admissions for top colleges, medical schools, and law schools start?\n- Why are UC schools more difficult to get into than other schools in California?\n- How do colleges help induct people into the upper class besides providing book-learning?\n"
