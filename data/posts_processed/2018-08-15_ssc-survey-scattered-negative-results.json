    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- The author's (Scott) blog traffic is declining, so he decides to write about last year's survey on perception questions, which has some negative results and is a summary of the survey.\n- The author was unable to expand on the suggestive results of the survey, nor strengthen them.\n- The author provides examples of how the correlations between different illusions and mental illnesses were low and lacked internal structure.\n- The Surgeon Riddle produced the most impressive results on the survey, but it may be a confounder rather than an actual result.\n- Age had a strong effect on the Parentheses Riddle, but nothing else.\n- The factor analysis did not produce any significant results, with none of the factors correlating well with anything else, nor was there an obvious pattern.\n\nKey learnings:\n- The survey did not produce any exciting or conclusive results and lacked internal structure.\n- Correlations between different illusions and mental illnesses were low and lacked internal structure.\n- The Surgeon Riddle produced the most significant results on the survey, but it may be a confounder rather than an actual result.\n- Age had a strong effect on the Parentheses Riddle, but nothing else.\n- The factor analysis did not produce any significant results, and there was no structure to the correlations observed.\n\nKey questions:\n- Were the results confounded by other factors rather than being actual results?\n- Can anyone do better than the author with the survey results?\n- What is the significance of the effect of age on the Parentheses Riddle?\n- What would a more principled definition of weirdness be?"
