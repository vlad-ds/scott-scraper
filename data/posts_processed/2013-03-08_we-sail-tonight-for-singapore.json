    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Singapore is widely regarded as a model government for Reactionaries.\n- It follows Reactionary-ish policies and is a nice place to live.\n- The post aims to examine whether its Reactionary policies cause its good government.\n- Another city-state with high levels of self-government, Hong Kong, will also be analysed.\n\nKey learnings\n- Singapore is an exceptionally well-run country with no natural resources and a small land area.\n- Hong Kong shares most of Singapore's advantages, and therefore Singapore did well because of other factors.\n- Supercapitalist Chinese-British city-states tend to do really well regardless of whether they are notably Reactionary or not.\n\nKey questions\n- Can we conclude that Singapore's Reactionary policies cause its good government?\n- Might Singapore have just been an exceptionally well-run country that by coincidence chose to follow Reactionary policies?\n- Do supercapitalist Chinese-British city-states do really well regardless of their political ideology?"
