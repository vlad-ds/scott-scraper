    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- The greatly accelerated pace of change in recent years could be a possible explanation for technological unemployment.\n- Technological progress has slowed down significantly, and the easy innovations have already been discovered.\n- Categorization of employment is a modern phenomenon and many workers historically worked from a very young age until death.\n- Human workers might maintain jobs for aesthetic and signaling purposes, even in a world of perfect, cheap android laborers.\n- A new technology that can substitute for manpower has led to a declining workforce.\n- In the past, new technologies have led to new jobs but this has not been the case with this technology that has led to wage stagnation.\n- Women entering the workforce may not necessarily create as many new jobs.\n- The lack of obvious jumps in unemployment and PAMLFNP hides regional inequalities.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Slow technological change in the past often spawned new industries for those whose jobs were automated, which is not the case today.\n- The reduction of working years through the lifespan cannot be fairly called \"technological unemployment.\"\n- There are institutional factors that play a significant role in the evolution of wage differentials.\n- The universal common-sense perception that parts of the Rust Belt are an apocalyptic mess right now is a matter that has to be considered.\n- Increases in housing costs due primarily to zoning have reduced aggregate GDP growth by 50% since 1960.\n\nKey questions:\n- Are we moving to a world where each generation has to learn to function in multiple worlds over the course of a lifetime?\n- Is there any reason to assume that the economy will automatically expand to absorb new workers, even with the doubling of the workforce in certain fields?\n- Is this experience not relevant, as robots and AI will very shortly do this again?\n- Shouldn't wages have crashed when the labor supply doubles?\n- Why has the automation of manufacturing not made a meaningful impact on the PAMLFPR nationwide?\n"
