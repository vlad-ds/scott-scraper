    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Twin studies are often used to investigate the \u201cnature vs. nurture\u201d question.\n- Interpersonal variation is separated into three baskets: heritable, shared environmental, and non-shared environmental.\n- Studies of different traits usually find that ~50% of the variation is heritable, ~50% is due to non-shared environment, and the contribution of shared environment is often negligible.\n- The summary \u201c50% nature, 50% nurture\u201d is wrong.\n- Non-shared environment is not really \u201cnon-shared environment,\u201d and things like error, luck of the draw, biological random noise, and the immune system all get tossed into this category.\n- Studies on specific nonshared environmental events have shown that the effect sizes are generally very small.\n\nKey learnings:\n- The \u201c50% nature, 50% nurture\u201d summary of twin studies is too simplistic.\n- Non-shared environment isn\u2019t really \u201cnon-shared environment,\u201d and many factors contribute to this category.\n- Specific nonshared environmental events generally have very small effect sizes.\n\nKey questions:\n- What are the implications of the \u201cnon-shared environment\u201d category being so diverse?\n- How can researchers create better methods for distinguishing between genetic and environmental factors?\n- What are the most effective ways to affect outcomes like intelligence, personality, income, and criminality?"
