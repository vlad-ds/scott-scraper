    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Controlling for confounders in studies is not as effective as previously believed.\n- Many studies may not be reliable due to questionable research practices in social psychology.\n- Increased Western demand for quinoa has actually improved welfare in Peruvian quinoa-farming regions.\n- A newly discovered text from Confucius' time challenges what we previously thought we knew about classical Chinese civilization.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Analystic thinking is inversely related to religiosity and moral concern.\n- Charter schools have shown success in educating disadvantaged minority children.\n- Women with a more feminine digit ratio have higher reproductive success.\n- Tracing untraceable IP addresses leads to a farm in Kansas.\n\nKey questions:\n- Why do studies that control for confounders not work as well as previously thought?\n- What are some of the questionable research practices in social psychology?\n- Why is the new study challenging previous assumptions about Haidtian moral foundations?\n- What was the reason for evolution to preserve the contrary set of genes for reproductive success in some women?"
