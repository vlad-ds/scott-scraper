    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- The Great Pyramid of Giza has been claimed to encode the speed of light to seven decimal places, but in reality, the coincidence only involves four decimal places of the latitude number.\n- The pseudoscientists who discovered the coincidence had many degrees of freedom to manipulate, which exponentially increases the number of lottery tickets they had to win a one-in-a-million chance.\n- The author questions whether other variables, such as the longitude or the color of the stones used to build the Pyramid, should be taken into account to properly evaluate the coincidence.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Coincidences with low probabilities can still occur if the pseudoscientists behind the discovery had many degrees of freedom to manipulate.\n- When evaluating coincidences, it's important to consider all variables that could be at play and not just the ones included in the original hypothesis.\n\nKey questions:\n- Should the author include other variables, such as the color of the stones used to build the Pyramid, in the evaluation of the coincidence?\n- How can researchers avoid the risk of seeing a coincidence where there is none when they have many degrees of freedom to manipulate in their study?\n- Is it fair to count all the different hypotheses and degrees of freedom when evaluating a coincidence, or should only the ones presented in the original hypothesis be considered?"
