    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Depressed people have worse sense of smell and people with worse sense of smell are more likely to get depressed.\n- Studies show that depressed subjects did marginally (but significantly) worse on the olfactory test than controls.\n- Respiratory diseases that impair sense of smell are linked to depression.\n- Animal experiments show that removing the olfactory bulbs of rats consistently makes them depressed.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Depression is a systemic disorder that can decrease sensory acuity in general.\n- Loss of smell is unique in its emotional effects and is pretty emotionally salient.\n- SSRIs seem to improve the sense of smell in the long term as part of their general treatment of depression.\n\nKey questions:\n- Why would depression reduce olfactory acuity? And why would reduced olfaction cause depression?\n- Does any form of decreased sensory acuity cause depression?\n- What does this imply about treating depression? Can you treat depression through improving olfactory sensitivity?\n- Can exposing depressed people to really strong smells help alleviate depression?"
