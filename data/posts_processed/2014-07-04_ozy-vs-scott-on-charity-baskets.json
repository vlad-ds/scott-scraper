    "summary": "Key ideas\n- The blog post discusses the effective altruism approach to charity donation.\n- The author argues that a society where everyone is an effective altruist would probably have a variety of different charities.\n- Disaster aversion is why we try to diversify our investments in the stock market, which works differently in charity where the first life saved doesn\u2019t matter any more than the 100,000th.\n- Low-hanging fruit refers to charities that are important up to a certain point, after which they become less effective.\n\nKey learnings\n- Diversifying charity donations isn't necessary in quite the way the Ozy thinks.\n- Some charities are important up to a certain point, after which they become superseded by other charities.\n- There is only one most efficient charity at any given time, and you should donate your entire donation to it.\n\nKey questions\n- What is the disaster aversion approach to effective altruism, and how is it related to diversifying in stock market investments?\n- How does the low-hanging fruit approach affect the way we decide which charities to donate to?\n- Are there any exceptions to the idea that donating to the most efficient charity at any given time is the best approach?"
