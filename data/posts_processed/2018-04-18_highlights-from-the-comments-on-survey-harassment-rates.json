    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Brymic attempted to reproduce the results of SSC Survey Results but couldn't reproduce the correlations between female victimization, male victimization and male perpetration.\n- Chris quotes a TIME article that argues that communities with oversupply of women have higher rates of sexual assault than communities with oversupply of men.\n- Discussions included the misrepresentation of harassment being in all technology companies instead of only in startups, theorizing whether sexual aggression is a result of being introverted or extroverted, and other factors that may affect sexual harassment in the survey.\n\nKey learnings:\n- The correlation between female victimization at work and outside work and that of males suggests a strong 'people in fields' effect without the need for the combination score.\n- Elevated rates of sexual harassment are a predictable feature of communities with oversupplies of women.\n- Brymic's findings could not be reproduced which means the data needs further analysis.\n\nKey questions:\n- Can we trust the misrepresentation of harassment in all technology companies instead of startups?\n- What factors impact sexual harassment rates, and how do they interact?\n- Is there further exploration that needs to be done to validate or invalidate the SSC Survey Results?"
