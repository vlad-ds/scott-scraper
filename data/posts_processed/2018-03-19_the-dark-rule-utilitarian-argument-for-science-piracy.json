    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- The author discusses the ethics of using Sci-Hub, a website that allows free access to scientific papers.\n- Two arguments against using Sci-Hub are presented, such as violating intellectual property rights and disregarding the moral obligations to follow laws.\n- The author argues that the scientific journal industry is flawed and suggests using civil disobedience to promote a search process for better institutions.\n\nKey learnings:\n- The scientific journal industry seems to be a rent-seeking abomination that doesn't add much real value.\n- Civil disobedience isn't justifiable for trivial reasons, but it can be a beneficial solution to inadequate equilibria.\n- Using Sci-Hub can be ethical because the system is broken and needs to be destroyed.\n\nKey questions:\n- Is intellectual property essential to encourage the production of intellectual goods? \n- How can we ensure that civil disobedience is not used as a tool to promote unjust causes?\n- What are the limitations of using civil disobedience to promote a search process for better institutions?"
