    "summary": "Key ideas\n- The existence of a Dark Age is subjective, as there are no objective criteria and assessments require subjective beliefs.\n- Postmodernism prioritizes thinking about agendas and politically-motivated people over objective historical facts.\n- Postmodernists find objective facts hard to pin down, and even statements like the year of the fall of Rome are up for debate.\n- Everyone is postmodernist sometimes, and postmodernism makes its way into literature, art, and architecture.\n- Postmodernism can collapse into people ignoring any facts they disagree with and believing that facts are mutable products of hostile power structures.\n\nKey learnings\n- Objective reality exists, but it can be difficult to discern and different people have different viewpoints.\n- There can be political agendas involved in the way history is presented and interpreted, and this can skew our understanding of it.\n- Postmodernism challenges the notion of objective truth, and stresses the importance of considering various perspectives.\n- While postmodernism can be helpful in exposing hidden biases, it can also lead to skepticism and nihilism.\n\nKey questions\n- How can we assess historical events objectively and without bias?\n- Is there a way to reconcile postmodernism and rationality?\n- How do power structures influence our understanding of truth?\n- What can we do to prevent postmodernism from collapsing into extreme skepticism?"
