    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Mark Hofmann, a forger who made a career out of creating false documents about Mormonism, sold forgeries to Mormon officials who wanted to cover up discrediting evidence.\n- Eleven European nations plan to mandate that recipients of government scientific grants publish resulting papers on open-access journals to raise their prestige.\n- A rapper is planning to build a cryptocurrency-themed city in Senegal.\n- China is calling for international collaboration in the field of AI, walking back its previous intention to dominate the field.\n- Genomic Prediction launches a test that assigns polygenic scores to embryos to let parents choose which ones to implant.\n- An algorithm clusters philosophy papers onto a 2D grid to make a map of philosophy.\n\nKey learnings\n- Exposure to opposing views on social media does not increase appreciation or liking of the opposing side, but rather increases partisan polarization.\n- Working from home is on the rise, which may be contributing to a decline in commuting by bicycle.\n- The brain\u2019s mapping of the visual field to the visual cortex using a polar-to-Cartesian coordinate transform may explain why people on hallucinogenic drugs often see spirals or concentric circles.\n- The solar cycle affects human lifespan, embryo survival, and number of children.\n- It is possible for people in one domain to have heterodox opinions in another domain, even going totally off the deep end.\n\nKey questions\n- How will the mandate for open-access journals impact scientific research?\n- Will the cryptocurrency-themed city in Senegal become a reality and what impact will it have?\n- What are the ethical concerns surrounding embryo selection based on polygenic testing?\n- How can we prevent polarization from increasing on social media?\n- Is the decline in bicycle commuting evidence of a larger trend towards working from home?\n- What impact will China's call for international collaboration in AI have on the industry?"
