    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- There is no agreed criterion to distinguish science from pseudoscience.\n- Post-empirical science is potentially dangerous.\n- Multiverse theories lack empirical evidence and are untestable.\n- Some theories are sufficiently vague to avoid experimental challenges, making them unscientific.\n- The demarcation problem of separating science from pseudoscience.\n- Falsifiability is not an absolute criterion but has degrees.\n- Science includes shades of grey and untestable theories.\n- Bayesian reasoning refers to Occam\u2019s Razor and inference to the best explanation.\n- Science has to deal with the untestable and non-empirical theories.\n\nKey learnings:\n- The elegance of a scientific theory is important in determining its plausibility.\n- Scientists may not always be able to empirically test hypotheses, but they can still use Occam's Razor to determine their plausibility.\n- The demarcation problem is unsolvable.\n- Testability implies empirical evidence and shades of grey.\n- Science is taming metaphysics or \u2018naturalising\u2019 it.\n- Bayesian methods can be objective or subjective.\n- Some scientific reasoning includes terms like \u201cOccam\u2019s Razor\u201d and \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t want to conclude something like that, would you?\u201d\n\nKey questions:\n- What distinguishes science from pseudoscience?\n- How can scientists determine the plausibility of hypotheses that they cannot empirically test?\n- What role does elegance play in scientific theories?\n- How do we include the untestable as a fundamental part of science?\n- How objective are Bayesian methods?\n- Is reasoning-from-simplicity a productive way to conduct science?\n- How can we consistently arrive at truth when using reasoning-from-simplicity?\n- How do we explain the untestable in science?\n"
