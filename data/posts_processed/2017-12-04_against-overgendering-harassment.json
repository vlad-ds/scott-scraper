    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- About 30% of sexual harassment victims are men and about 20% of perpetrators are women.\n- Media coverage of sexual harassment has been gendered, often ignoring men's experiences as victims or women's experiences as perpetrators.\n- Gendered coverage creates a \"hit job on the outgroup\" and ensures that nobody has more than half of the picture.\n- To address sexual harassment, we need to treat it the same way we treat terrorism, as something bad that can be committed by anyone regardless of group membership.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Gendered coverage of sexual harassment doesn't help anyone and prevents a fuller understanding of the problem.\n- Statistics show that men and women can be victims of sexual harassment and men and women can be perpetrators.\n- To tackle sexual harassment, we need to focus on creating a just system where all allegations are properly investigated and handled.\n\nKey questions:\n- Why is the media coverage of sexual harassment so gendered and what can be done to address this?\n- How do we create a system where all allegations of sexual harassment are investigated fairly, regardless of the gender of the victim or perpetrator?\n- How can we change the narrative around sexual harassment to ensure that everyone understands they can be a victim or perpetrator regardless of their gender?"
