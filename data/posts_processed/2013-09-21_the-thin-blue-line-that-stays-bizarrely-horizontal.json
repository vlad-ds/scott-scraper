    "summary": "Key ideas\n- NOMINATE is a statistical system that determines which legislators are more liberal or conservative than others.\n- Long-term legislators can be used to \"bridge\" different sections of Congress.\n- DW-NOMINATE is an enhanced version of NOMINATE that can compare different sections of Congress.\n- DW-NOMINATE has been recognized as broadly accurate and is used by Nate Silver.\n\nKey learnings\n- Congress is getting more polarized recently, and the Republicans took a big turn to the right starting in 1980.\n- There has been no liberal drift of either party over the past 120 years according to DW-NOMINATE.\n\nKey questions\n- How can it be possible that there has been no liberal drift of either party over the past 120 years?\n- Is it kosher to use DW-NOMINATE data to make time comparisons?"
