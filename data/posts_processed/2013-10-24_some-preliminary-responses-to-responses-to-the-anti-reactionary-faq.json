    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Criticisms of the Anti-Reactionary FAQ focused on the author's focus on 50-year social indicators rather than preindustrial village society.\n- The author defends this focus by noting that many Reactionaries claim that society was better 50 years ago.\n- The author poses key questions about when social indicators changed direction and why.\n- The author argues that the dysfunctionality of modern culture is worse for lower-class urbanites and the uneducated; the author suggests the wealthy upper class values should be emulated.\n- The author argues that self-respecting men cannot marry sluts.\n- The author discusses the flaws of the Cathedral concept.\n\nKey learnings:\n- There is a debate about whether society was better 50 years ago or in preindustrial village society.\n- Modern sexual norms work better for upper-class suburban whites than for lower-class urbanites and the uneducated.\n- People should not marry sluts.\n- The idea of the Cathedral has flaws.\n\nKey questions:\n- When did social indicators change direction, and why?\n- Can the values of the wealthy be exported to the lower class?\n- What is the real objection to sluttiness?\n- What is the Cathedral?"
