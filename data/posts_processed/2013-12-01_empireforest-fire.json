    "summary": "Key ideas \n- Two bloggers propose a concept called the \"left singularity\" where the shift to the left leads to instability and collapse.\n- The author challenges this idea citing cases in history where oppressive monarchies often led to reigns of terror, while democracy and leftism did not. \n- The author proposes an alternate model where a strong repressive monarchy is overthrown, followed by a na\u00efve revolution, and eventually a reign of terror, ending with intervention, and finally, a more mellow government.\n\nKey learnings\n- Historical examples suggest that oppressive monarchies and strong right-wing dictatorships are more prone to initiating reigns of terror as compared to democracy and leftism.\n- Moderate-left ideas do not necessarily lead to a reign of terror, contrary to what is proposed by the left singularity concept.\n- Democratic nations with free speech and fair elections are less likely to experience reigns of terror.\n\nKey questions\n- What is the left singularity, and how does it propose the shift to the left leads to instability and collapse? \n- What is the author's alternate model, and how does it support the idea that oppressive monarchies lead to reigns of terror? \n- Can a good example of a reign of terror be found in a nation that has been a stable democracy for at least one generation beforehand?"
