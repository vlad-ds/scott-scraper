        "we find across three experiments that extreme protest tactics decreased popular support for a given cause because they reduced feelings of identification with the movement. Though this effect obtained in tests of popular responses to extreme tactics used by animal rights, Black Lives Matter, and anti-Trump protests (Studies 1-3), we found that self-identified political activists were willing to use extreme tactics because they believed them to be effective for recruiting popular support ",

    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Oliceride, a new opioid, may be much safer than morphine.\n- Wellbutrin has a delayed effect, and works well after a \"second wind\".\n- Each decile of wealth in the United States performs poorly compared to equivalent deciles in other countries, irrespective of ethnicity.\n- Modafinil enhances cognitive capacity by improving attention and concentration, rather than directly enhancing IQ.\n- Older fathers have more de novo mutations than younger fathers, which disproves the objection that fathers with worse genes will tend to get married later.\n- New Zealand tries to figure out how Peter Thiel became a secret citizen.\n- Gene drive testing thwarted when organisms develop resistance.\n- Extreme protest tactics reduce popular support for social movements, because they reduce feelings of identification with the movement.\n- Major accountancy firm Ernst & Young removes the requirement for employees to have a college degree.\n- New phase of matter called \"time crystals\" has been discovered.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Oliceride, a new opioid drug, could revolutionize the way chronic pain is treated.\n- It's important to wait to evaluate the effectiveness of a drug before determining its true value, as with Wellbutrin.\n- The United States has a comprehensive education problem, not simply one of ethnic distribution.\n- Modafinil's cognitive-enhancing properties lie in its duration of action and heightened focus.\n- In older men, de novo mutations increase, meaning there is a moderate correlation between paternal age and genetic defects.\n- The pursuit of power can lead to powerful immoral systems, such as Thiel's citizenship controversy.\n- Gene alteration might not be as simple as in the straightforward designer-baby narrative.\n- When movements resort to extreme tactics, they lose their support base and sympathy of the masses.\n- Removing degree requirement in corporate job recruitment might become a norm in seeking earnest and capable candidates.\n- There's a discovery of a new phase of matter which could change our understanding of physics.\n\nKey questions:\n- Can we trust new drugs to be safer than their predecessors? \n- How can we better evaluate drug effectiveness, and what problems can arise from an incomplete evaluation? \n- Is the education system broken in the United States, and if so, is it a fixable problem?\n- Are the cognitive-enhancing properties of modafinil through heightened focus generalizeable to any situation? \n- Can we take the de novo mutations argument as sound evidence for a causal relationship between paternal age and genetic defects?\n- What other controversies surrounding Thiel and citizenship are there?\n- What else can we do to alter genes in organisms in a way that is not dangerous or ineffective? \n- How can effective protest tactics be channelled? Is there such thing as being \"too extreme\" in political movements? \n- Can we effectively alleviate the escalating underemployment using other recruitment tactics besides filtering candidates by their education attainment?\n- What implications does this discovery of a new phase of matter have for the future?"
