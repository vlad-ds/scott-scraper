    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Benjamin Lay, a Quaker abolitionist, kidnapped a slaveowner\u2019s child to give a taste of what slaves went through.\n- Most drugs are neither dangerous nor ineffective once expired, yet billions of dollars are spent on expiry dates in the health system.\n- Traditional factors do not lead to intrastate conflict and rebellion; it's mostly related to the economy and slow growth.\n- Neoliberals are free-market globalists who believe free markets and commercial capitalism are the tools of social justice.\n- Tengrism, the religion of Genghis Khan, is making a comeback in Central Asian republics as a nationalist alternative to Islam.\n- Stronger obsessive-compulsive symptoms are associated with more right-wing ideological preferences according to a study.\n- Elite descendant from pre-1949 make up 84% of the current elite. This suggests that communism may not have a dramatic impact upon the elites.\n- Statistical threshold for significance should be raised from p = 0.05 to p = 0.005.\n- US court grants journals millions of dollars in damages from Sci-Hub. Sci-Hub is a free and easy access source for almost all scientific papers.\n- Bernie Sanders' policies are well within the bounds of neoliberalism, not socialism.\n- California\u2019s right-to-die law is disproportionately being used by college-educated white men.\n- Everything math- and computer-related has much lower divorce rates than everything else.\n- Having autism risk genes increases intelligence, but you become vulnerable to all of the normal cognitive deficits when you actually have autism.\n- Strong Republicans and Democrats are psychologically similar with respect to authoritarianism.\n- Congress passes \u201cright to try\u201d bill allowing terminally ill people to access not-yet-FDA-approved medications.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Expired drugs are mostly safe to consume.\n- The economy and slow growth are the main factors that lead to rebellion.\n- Neoliberals are proponents of free-market globalism and believe free markets and capitalism are the tools of social justice.\n- Obsessive-compulsive symptoms are associated with right-wing political preferences.\n- Elite descendants make up most of the current elite, showing that communism has not had a significant impact on the elites.\n- Statistical threshold for significance should be raised from p = 0.05 to p = 0.005.\n- Sci-Hub provides easy access to most scientific papers.\n- Bernie Sander's policies are well within the bounds of neoliberalism, not socialism.\n- California\u2019s right-to-die law is disproportionately being used by college-educated white men.\n- Math- and computer-related professions have a lower divorce rate.\n- Autism risk genes increase intelligence but make one vulnerable to cognitive deficits.\n- Strong Republicans and Democrats are psychologically similar with respect to authoritarianism.\n\nKey questions:\n- How can the amount of waste in the medical profession be reduced?\n- How can rebellion and conflict be prevented in countries with poor economies?\n- How can capitalist systems help poor people and provide social justice?\n- Are there other correlations with right-wing political preferences beyond obsessive-compulsive symptoms?\n- How can social privileges for the act of dying be solved?\n- Why do math- and computer-related professions have a lower divorce rate?\n- How can we better explain why people choose the political groups they do?"
