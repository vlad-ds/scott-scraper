    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Maoist China's obsession with mangoes was taken to a point where a dentist was executed for comparing one to a sweet potato.\n- Genes expressed in autism are also expressed in men; re-igniting the doubt around male brain theory of autism.\n- The participants of The Biggest Loser mostly gained weight back, and the show is accused of giving illegal drugs to contestants.\n- Radar detector detector detector, a technology that detects radar detectors, is likely a hoax.\n- Mercy for Animals conducted a study on vegetarianism ads and found inconsistent results.\n- A review of a contrarian mental health book on schizophrenia by Robert Whitaker by E. Fuller Torrey.\n- Russian President Vladimir Putin offers free land and infrastructure to foreigners in the Far East.\n- The US cancer deaths have gone down by 26% since 1990.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Psychologizing other people should have a high burden of proof, as failure to meet it could lead to wrong conclusions.\n- Good schools don't necessarily guarantee success, according to the study by the Adam Smith Institute.\n- Rich people were found to have more success in getting what they want in US politics.\n- It is difficult to focus on debunking dangerous ideas to skeptics, as suggested by John Horgan, without proper understanding of the topic.\n- Sophisticated models are not always reliable like the study on practice effects by athletes onto the sports outcome.\n\nKey questions:\n- Does Schizophrenia expert E. Fuller Torrey differ significantly in his views on Anatomy of an Epidemic?\n- What's wrong with Salon today?\n- Is Madsen Pirie's prophecy about the 2016 POTUS elections being won by Donald Trump legitimate?\n- Why are Congressional Democrats becoming more conservative on rainy days?"
