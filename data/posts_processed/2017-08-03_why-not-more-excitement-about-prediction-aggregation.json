    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Metaculus is a crowd-sourced prediction engine that predicts major scientific breakthroughs like AI, genetic engineering, and pandemics.\n- Despite the accuracy of crowd-sourced aggregator tools, there are no prediction markets consultants or think tanks available to leverage the predictive power of these tools.\n- The founder of Metaculus attributes the prediction industry's limitations to their small budget and limited personnel.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Crowdsourcing predictive intelligence is a powerful tool that can work for big-ticket items like predicting future global events.\n- The main challenge in leveraging predictive intelligence is limited personnel and budget resources.\n- The ability to make probabilistic predictions is confined to only a small fraction of the population.\n\nKey questions:\n- Why has the predictive market taken so long to catch on, even though online for-cash prediction markets have been available?\n- Why isn't there a consultant superforecaster think tank available?\n- Is there data that demonstrates accuracy changes with the number of predictors and predictor quality?"
