    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Over 60% of psychology experiments failed to replicate in a recent study\n- Failure to replicate is a normal part of how science works \n- Scientists must figure out under what conditions a phenomenon is true\n- Publication bias, experimenter effects and statistical malpractice contribute to the replication crisis in psychology\n\nKey learnings:\n- Failure to replicate is not necessarily a cause for alarm in science\n- Psychology needs to reconcile differences in replication conditions in an informed Bayesian way \n- Claims of scientific understanding in psychology are weaker due to the likelihood of a phenomenon being true only under certain conditions \n\nKey questions:\n- What factors contribute to the failure to replicate in psychology experiments?\n- Is it possible to reconcile replication differences in an informative Bayesian way? \n- How can we solve the replication crisis in psychology, and what are we up against?"
