    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Generic medications are often priced exorbitantly high as well\n- Insurance co-pays can lead to distorted pricing and lack of competition\n- FDA regulations make it difficult for competitors to produce generic medications\n- Bioequivalence studies and FDA approval can cost millions of dollars and take up to three years\n- Small groups can synthesize certain active ingredients in experimental drugs and buy them in bulk for a few dollars per pill\n\nKey learnings\n- Generic drug manufacturers cannot produce competitors for older, niche market drugs because of the fixed costs associated with bioequivalence studies, and extremely low demand\n- In some cases, monopolies arise from FDA allowing a company to produce an exclusive drug after doing extensive studies on an old public domain drug\n- Michigan registers the prices of the drugs through zip codes, allowing comparison and can lead to huge price differences between pharmacies\n-\u00a0Insurance companies and co-pays can play significant roles in inflated drug prices\n\nKey questions\n-\u00a0Why does the FDA require bioequivalence studies on old, public domain drugs?\n- How can insurance companies prevent inflated drug prices?\n- Can different oversight measures be put in place to lower drug prices?"
