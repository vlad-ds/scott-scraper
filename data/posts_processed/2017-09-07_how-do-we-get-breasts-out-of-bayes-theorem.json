    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Predictive processing poses a problem for theories of innate knowledge\n- PP theory can explain cognitive deviations from a blank slate that involve the rules of cognition\n- Evolutionary psychology is a confusion of levels when it comes to gene expression and high-level categories like \"breasts\"\n- Animals have instincts that sometimes look like weird Rube Goldberg circuits made of brain circuits\n- The example of sex/gender is where animals clearly have an instinctive understanding of a high-level concept\n\nKey learnings:\n- Infants construct priors out of sensory evidence\n- Basic assumptions might be learned, such as that the world is usually in one determinate state or another\n- We eventually gain concepts through trial-and-error and successful predictions about the sensory world\n- Evolution may not be able to hard-code the process of inferring gender\n\nKey questions:\n- How does evolutionary psychology explain high-level categories like \"breasts\"?\n- Can a gene just reach into the level of already-formed concepts and tweak them?\n- How do animals have instincts for high-level concepts like sex/gender?"
