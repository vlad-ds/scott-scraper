    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- The post invites the reader to identify a mistake in a seemingly normal map.\n- The mistake is caused by the reader's mental models and expectations of how maps are constructed.\n- The post suggests that people often rely on mental shortcuts and assumptions that hinder their ability to see things as they actually are.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Our mental models and expectations can sometimes prevent us from seeing things as they really are.\n- To overcome these limitations, we may need to challenge our assumptions and consider different perspectives.\n- Maps (and other representations of reality) are not necessarily accurate or objective, and we should approach them with a critical eye.\n\nKey questions:\n- What are some other examples of situations where our mental models can lead us astray?\n- How can we develop a more nuanced understanding of the world around us?\n- What are some practical steps we can take to challenge our assumptions and biases?"
