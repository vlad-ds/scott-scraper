    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- 60-80% of schizophrenics smoke compared to 20% of the general population\n- The cause for this is still unclear\n- Genetics related to nicotine receptors may be involved\n- Schizophrenic patients smoke to supplement the failed nicotine system in their brain and feel better\n\nKey learnings:\n- Smoking potentially prevents schizophrenia rather than causing it\n- Second study showed that without confounders, smokers were more likely to get schizophrenia, but once adjusted for confounders, smokers are less likely\n- Controlling for fewer things does not provide better data\n\nKey questions:\n- Why do schizophrenics smoke?\n- Does smoking cause schizophrenia, or prevent it?\n- What is the reason for conflicting evidence on whether smoking increases or decreases the risk of schizophrenia?"
