    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Coordination problems arise when rich people try to influence government policies for their own benefit.\n- Free rider problems and the need for concerted effort of all rich people make coordination harder.\n- Rich people may have a harder time than good people rallying support for important causes due to the nature of their interests.\n- An appeal to principle works better in normal politics than \"soak the poor to line our own pockets\" campaign.\n- Rich people's participation in politics might be influenced by sincere belief in their moral values that coincidentally help make them richer.\n\nKey learnings\n- Rich people don't seem to directly coordinate to bribe politicians in their favor.\n- Rich people could participate in politics due to sincere belief in their moral values that help drive their self-interest.\n- A moral system that is self-sacrificing on an individual level but helps the rich person get richer may emerge without conscious awareness.\n\nKey questions\n- Is there a spooky system that generates heartfelt moral philosophies on demand to solve coordination problems?\n- If the rich are not actually coordinating, why do they consistently keep getting lucky?\n- Why don't the poor coordinate as well as the rich?\n- How much more credence should we give other conspiracy theories?"
