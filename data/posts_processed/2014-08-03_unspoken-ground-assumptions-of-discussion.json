    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Writing something implies believing in it, which can have negative effects on free speech.\n- There are different modes of presenting an argument, such as judge mode or lawyer mode.\n- Explaining an underlying mechanism is different from describing how it works in the real world.\n- Differentiating between pointing out a specific problem and contributing to an abstract discussion is important.\n- Hypotheses are important for opening up discussion and gathering evidence.\n\nKey learnings\n- Logical fallacies can result from ambiguity in unspoken grounds.\n- It may be difficult to avoid accusations of bias, just-so stories, or lack of evidence when presenting arguments.\n- Consistently sticking to one side of a dichotomy may alleviate confusion.\n\nKey questions\n- Should we be more mindful of the implicit beliefs we present when we write about something?\n- What are some other modes of presenting an argument besides judge mode and lawyer mode?\n- How can we better distinguish between describing the real world and underlying mechanisms?\n- How can we ensure that our arguments contribute to a problem instead of hindering it?\n- Why do people tend to dismiss a hypothesis for political reasons, and how can we prevent this?"
