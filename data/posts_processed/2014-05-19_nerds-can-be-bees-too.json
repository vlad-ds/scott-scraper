    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Author Scott struggles with the concept of the \"hive switch,\" or the ability to experience the sense of ecstatic union with a group\n- Many readers expressed difficulty with experiencing communal emotions or group activities\n- The author and his friends found belonging in micronations, and the rationalist community and could experience patriotic emotions once they found a group that was truly their in-group.\n\nKey learnings\n- Feeling like you're a part of a tribe or community is a crucial part of what makes life worth living.\n- The inability to connect with certain groups does not mean that the \"hive switch\" is broken but rather that the group is not their in-group.\n\nKey questions\n- How can one identify their in-group?\n- Are there some people who simply do not have the ability to experience the \"hive switch\"? \n- Can the \"hive switch\" be developed or is it purely innate?"
