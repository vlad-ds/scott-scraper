    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Schizophrenics and autistics are less susceptible to optical illusions, indicating differences in cognitive processing\n- Survey results suggest that transgender people also have altered perception, specifically related to NMDA dysfunction\n- NMDA dysfunction is implicated in schizophrenia and autism, and estrogen improves NMDA function\n- Transgender people have higher rates of mental illness, but it may be due to a general factor rather than specific factors.\n- Schizophrenia and autism are 80+% genetic and harder to explain away as unrelated.\n- Replication of the transgender Hollow Mask pattern and investigating whether supplements can improve gender dysphoria are potential next steps.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Transgender people have higher rates of autism and schizophrenia than the general population\n- Dissociative symptoms are prevalent among the transgender population\n- Estrogen may alleviate these symptoms by promoting NMDA function\n- The potential link between gender identity and NMDA function should be further investigated.\n- Chronic use of some supplements may improve gender dysphoria, but the risks should be considered.\n\nKey questions:\n- Is NMDA hypofunction related to transgender?\n- What is the significance of the Spinning Dancer illusion results?\n- Why does testosterone improve dissociative symptoms in trans men?\n- How are gender identity and NMDA function linked?\n- Can chronic use of supplements that improve NMDA function, like glycine and sarcosine, augment estrogen in improving gender dysphoria?\n- How can the transgender Hollow Mask pattern be replicated and confounding factors addressed?\n"
