    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- New Atheism was a powerful force in online discourse in the early 2000s.\n- The movement included online forums, books, debates, and merchandise focused on atheism.\n- Religion vs. atheism was viewed as the most important issue in the world at that time.\n- However, the movement began to decline around 2012 and has faded out since then.\n- New Atheism emerged as a more political and brash movement after Richard Dawkins\u2019 publication of The God Delusion in 2006.\n- The movement was obsessed with the issue of the day and had a celebrity-based structure.\n- Atheism Plus, a combination of \u201catheism plus social justice,\u201d was a branding initiative that eventually turned the entire atheist movement into a \u201cblogs by atheists about social justice\u201d outlet.\n- Comparing the rise and fall of the New Atheism movement to the current rise of social justice activism.\n- Highlighting the underlying need for a \"hamartiology\", or a framework for understanding what is wrong with the world.\n- Examining how this need for a framework has shifted from atheism to social justice.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Online culture in the early 2000s was characterized by lengthy, intellectual discussions and the abundance of information.\n- The decline of this culture coincided with the fade of New Atheism.\n- Atheism-related search terms and articles continued to rise even after the peak of New Atheism.\n- Early Internet Argument Culture (EIAC) was a prelude to New Atheism, which emerged post-2006 and became more centralized and political.\n- Atheism Plus signaled the transformation of the atheist movement into social justice blogging.\n- The rise and fall of the New Atheism movement can be attributed to a lack of a unifying hamartiology.\n- Social justice activism is currently serving as a replacement for the hamartiology of atheism.\n- The socialist wing of the Democratic Party is attempting to shift the hamartiology again, from race and gender to class.\n\nKey questions:\n- What caused the decline of the early Internet Argument Culture?\n- Why did people stop caring about online debates and discussion?\n- What was the role of later social media forums in this decline?\n- What happened to the Old Atheist blogs, and how did the Atheism Plus branding initiative affect the movement?\n- Why did a successful social movement like New Atheism turn into a totally different social movement, one concerned entirely with social justice?\n- How do we avoid getting too swept away by any particular narrative or trend?\n- Will social justice activism serve as a new hamartiology for the long-term, or will another framework eventually take its place?\n- How can we use the history of past movements to understand the current one, and avoid repeating any mistakes?\n"
