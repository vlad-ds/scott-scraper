    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Scott tries Sleep Support to improve his sleep quality and wakes up naturally at 9am on the first night.\n- He conducts a randomized controlled trial for 24 nights on Sleep Support vs. placebo pills to monitor his subjective sleep experience.\n- The results showed no difference in sleep quality and the effect Scott observed was due to a placebo effect.\n- Despite Sleep Support not working, Scott considers the experiment successful as he is waking up an hour earlier and not feeling more tired.\n\nKey learnings\n- Controlled self-experimentation can be a useful method in evaluating the effects of supplements.\n- Placebo effects can impact sleep quality, and external cues like checking the clock can influence wake-up time.\n- The success of a biohacking experiment can sometimes be subjective.\n\nKey questions\n- Does Sleep Support work for people with insomnia or other sleep disorders?\n- How can self-experimenters better account for placebo effects in their experiments?\n- What other external cues can affect sleep quality and wake-up time?"
