    "summary": "Key ideas\n- The ApoE4 gene is a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.\n- A study by Lineweaver et al tested 144 elderly adults for the ApoE4 gene and found that those who knew they had it did significantly worse on memory tests compared to those who didn't know.\n- The medical community is concerned that giving people their genetic test results may be dangerous.\n\nKey learnings\n- Letting people know their genetic risks may lead to worse cognitive outcomes than if they didn't know\n- However, the study does not provide enough details to understand the implications fully.\n\nKey questions\n- What methodological details were not provided, and why are they important?\n- Could knowing one's genetic risks prime subjects to perform worse on tests?\n- Is there a potential for harmful side effects from genetic testing?"
