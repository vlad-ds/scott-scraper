    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Medicine uses guidelines to provide recommendations for treatment.\n- Guidelines include more than one recommendation and specific criteria for success or failure.\n- Guidelines acknowledge that everyone is different and may need more than one recommendation.\n- Guidelines contain information about correlations and anti-correlations.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Guidelines provide valuable information about a field and can help tailor recommendations to specific circumstances.\n- Once someone understands a field well, they can create their own personal guidelines.\n- Making guidelines can be risky but they provide valuable help in fields like dieting and nootropics, where there aren't many guidelines.\n\nKey questions:\n- Why don't people who have more knowledge of nutrition make dieting guidelines?\n- Why aren't there more guidelines in fields like nootropics and self-help?\n- Does making guidelines seem like a claim to knowledge that people are afraid to make?"
