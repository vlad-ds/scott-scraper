    "summary": "Key ideas\n- The difficulty in learning science subjects is the lack of semantic cues in their structures.\n- It is easier to remember structures when they are loaded with human-accessible meaning.\n- The isomorphism between complicated structures in science and those in fictional works, like Game of Thrones, could be exploited to make science learning easier.\n- The social data that people acquire seems less susceptible to decay from disuse than scientific data.\n\nKey learnings\n- Using a story or a fictional work with an isomorphic structure can supplement traditional science textbooks.\n- The use of actors in an adaptation can facilitate another level of encoding in the students' memory.\n\nKey questions\n- Is it possible to produce a story as enjoyable as Game of Thrones which is isomorphic to the most important pathways in molecular biology?\n- What type of field of study might be more amenable to this kind of treatment than biology?"
