    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Study on gender bias on pull request acceptance in open source projects was not peer-reviewed and conducted by undergraduate students.\n- Women actually get more pull requests accepted than men in the top ten programming languages.\n- Revealing a contributor's gender usually gives women a small advantage in pull request acceptance.\n- Men and women's acceptance rates decrease when gender is revealed, but women's rates decrease more than men's (though it's unclear if the difference is statistically significant).\n- Lower acceptance rates for women appear to mainly come from other women's rejections.\n\nKey learnings:\n- The media can easily twist research findings without proper evaluation and investigation.\n- Not all studies are peer-reviewed, and some may not have enough data analysis to support their conclusions.\n\nKey questions:\n- Why did the study not provide a study-wide analysis and account for possible confounders?\n- What would happen if the study provided all numbers for their graphs and data?\n- How can the scientific community work towards peer-reviewing research findings and educating the general public about proper journalism standards?"
