    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Developmental psychology describes how children go from helpless infants to reasonable adults through cognitive development. \n- Less than half of the people in modern western countries have attained Kegan\u2019s fourth stage of moral development, and only a small handful attained his fifth.\n- Mental operations considered as developmental milestones include theory of mind, self-environment distinction, probabilistic thinking, and understanding trade-offs.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Development is not a matter of certain innate abilities like walking unfolding at the right time, but about difficult mental operations that one either learns or doesn't.\n- People have different mind designs that influence their beliefs, judgments and opinions. It's important to understand this to get along with others and maintain boundaries/preferences.\n- Rationality and psychotherapy both aim to cultivate mental operations that expand one's cognitive abilities, including distinguishing \"the things my brain tells me\" from \"reality\" and thinking probabilistically.\n\nKey questions:\n- Are there any basic mental operations that the author still doesn't have, and how would they recognize them and learn them once they do?\n- How can the insight that people have different mind designs be used to help break certain people out of their egocentrism and teach them how to deal with other humans?"
