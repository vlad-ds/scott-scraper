    "summary": "Key ideas\n- A study of 4,000 doctors showed that only 42% of Ob/Gyn residents could correctly answer a true-false question on p-values.\n- The same study showed that only 26% of doctors could answer a multiple-choice question on mammogram results, even though the question almost gave the correct answer.\n- Doctors who got the statistics questions wrong were more likely to say they had good training in statistical literacy.\n- Women rated their statistical literacy worse than men did, but did not actually do worse on the questions.\n- Only 12% of doctors got both questions correct.\n\nKey learnings\n- Doctors' statistical knowledge may not be as good as we assume.\n- Doctors who get basic statistics questions wrong may not be aware of how little they know.\n- Women may underestimate their statistical knowledge compared to men.\n- Even getting one question right may not make someone more likely to do well on the other.\n\nKey questions\n- Does this data suggest that doctors need more statistical education?\n- Is it fair to expect doctors to know more about statistics than the general population?\n- How can we ensure that doctors have the statistical knowledge they need to make informed decisions?"
