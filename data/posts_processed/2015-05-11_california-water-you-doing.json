    "summary": "Key ideas\n- California receives 80 million acre-feet of water per year, of which 23 million are unusable for humans and are stuck in wild rivers. \n- 14 million acre-feet are diverted for environmental and recreational purposes. \n- Agriculture uses 34 million acre-feet, with alfalfa being the most water-expensive crop at 5.3 million acre-feet consumed each year. \n- All urban water consumption totals 9 million acre-feet, with personal use by average citizens at 2.8 million acre-feet. \n- A water shortfall of 6 million acre-feet per year is being sustained by exploiting non-renewable groundwater and other sources.\n\nKey learnings\n- Alfalfa production uses 5.3 million acre-feet, while Nestle's plant uses only 150 acre-feet. \n- The federal government ordering California to spend 12,000 acre-feet of water to save six fish costs about $2 per fish. \n- A potential solution to California's drought is to pay the alfalfa industry their usual yearly income to not grow any alfalfa, which would cost $860 million and free up 5.3 million acre-feet.\n\nKey questions\n- How much of California's water actually goes to environmental causes? \n- What is the actual cost of preventing the Sacramento River Delta from turning salty? \n- How much would it cost to buy out all alfalfa growers and at what political cost?"
