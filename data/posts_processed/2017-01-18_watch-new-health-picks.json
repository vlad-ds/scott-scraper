    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Trump's health care picks, particularly those for FDA commissioner, are potentially interesting.\n- Jim O'Neill and Balaji Srinavasan are possible candidates for FDA commissioner who are part of the second cluster of libertarians interested in using competition to kindle innovation and help regular people.\n- O'Neill and Srinavasan could implement policies such as medical reciprocity with Europe, a less burdensome approval process for generic medications, and a stop to practices that let companies \"steal\" popular drugs and jack up prices.\n- John Ioannidis, a Stanford statistician, is a potential candidate for NIH chief and promotes high-quality studies in medical research.\n\nKey learnings\n- Medical reciprocity with Europe could provide an immediate windfall of dozens of drugs with unimpeachable records for almost no cost.\n- A less burdensome approval process for generic medications could lower the price of many medications by an order of magnitude and prevent scandals like Daraprim and EpiPens.\n- O'Neill's proposal to approve drugs based on safety but not efficacy could increase academic studies and good judgement in drug approvals as well as be a bold revolutionary high-variance bad idea.\n- Having high scientific standards in US medical research could be accomplished by appointing John Ioannidis as NIH chief.\n\nKey questions\n- Who are some of Trump's other health care picks besides those mentioned in the post and what are their backgrounds?\n- What are some of the arguments against implementing O'Neill's proposal to approve drugs based on safety but not efficacy?\n- What other policies could O'Neill and Srinavasan potentially implement if appointed as FDA commissioner?"
