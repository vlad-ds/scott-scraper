    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- A Swedish news team found the largest Viking treasure in history while filming a segment on amateur treasure-hunters.\n- Remittance men were common enough in Old Western towns to make up a majority of some populations.\n- GDP growth depends on population, capital, and productivity, with productivity growing in fits and starts that average out to appear smooth.\n- Jonathan Wild, known as the \u201cThief-Taker General\u201d, was secretly a mob boss who arranged crimes for his own benefit.\n- The potential of gene editing for good outcomes is debated, evidenced by the Chinese CRISPR babies and differing opinions among scientists and the public.\n- Strong evidence suggests increased school spending can improve school outcomes.\n- Residents of Quebec commemorated a flood with an insensitively-named monument.\n- A review suggests that sex hormones do not significantly affect decision-making.\n- Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may affect cognition.\n- Dylan Matthews\u2019 Vox article argues why trying to get along with political enemies is not worth it.\n- Scientists believe that Jeanne Calment, who died at the age of 122, was not the oldest person ever and that her daughter assumed her identity for financial reasons.\n\nKey learnings:\n- A coincidence may lead to unlikely discoveries, as demonstrated by the Swedish news team.\n- Parts of history that may seem outdated, such as remittance men, can have lasting effects on modern populations.\n- GDP growth is a complex phenomenon influenced by multiple factors.\n- Even charismatic public figures can have insidious secrets, such as Jonathan Wild\u2019s crimes.\n- Gene editing has great potential but sparks ethical debates.\n- School spending can make a difference in education outcomes.\n- Monuments have the potential to offend groups of people.\n- Hormones may affect other aspects of health but likely do not significantly impact decision-making.\n- Popular medications may have unintended consequences on cognition.\n- Some may argue that trying to find common ground with political enemies is not worth the effort.\n- Truths we accept as fact may be false, such as the age of Jeanne Calment.\n\nKey questions:\n- Can coincidences be harnessed for more unlikely discoveries?\n- How have historical practices and figures left a lasting impact on current populations and systems?\n- How can we reconcile the complicated factors that contribute to GDP growth?\n- Can people in power always be trusted, or may they have hidden selfish motives?\n- How can we harness the potential of gene editing while also addressing ethical dilemmas?\n- What is the most effective way to improve education outcomes?\n- How can we honor historical events without offending people?\n- What are the different factors that affect decision-making?\n- What are the potential unintended consequences of commonly-used medications?\n- What is the best approach to dealing with political enemies and opposing views?\n- How do we know which \u201cfacts\u201d are true and which may be false?"
