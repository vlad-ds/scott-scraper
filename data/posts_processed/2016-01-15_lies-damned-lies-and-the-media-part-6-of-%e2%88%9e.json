    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Breitbart's article \"Rape Deniers: 9 Facts About Illegal Alien Crime The Media Covers Up\" uses statistics to show that illegal immigrants to the United States are involved in a lot of crime, especially sexual crime.\n- The article argues that immigrant-heavy areas have disproportionate amounts of crime that represent the country's entire crime load as a whole.\n- Breitbart's statistics are flawed and do not give meaningful information.\n\nKey learnings\n- The use of statistics in news articles can be misleading and is misused in both liberal and conservative news sources.\n- It is important to practice Gettier politics and understand that both sides are capable of spreading lies and misconceptions.\n- The fallacy of assuming the other side is decent and intellectually honest is an obstacle to changing one's mind.\n\nKey questions\n- What are some examples of misleading statistics used in liberal news sources?\n- How can we better understand and approach conversations with those who hold opposing viewpoints?\n- What are some suggested ways to counteract the spread of misinformation in news articles?"
