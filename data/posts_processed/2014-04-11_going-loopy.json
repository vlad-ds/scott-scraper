    "summary": "Key ideas\n- The brain has mechanisms to prevent runaway feedback loops in response to emotions, but they can fail.\n- Anxiety disorders often involve feedback loops where worry about the disorder itself intensifies the disorder.\n- Mental health vocabulary and diagnosis may unintentionally increase feedback loops.\n- Serotonergic drugs, which are used to treat anxiety and depression, may affect the brain's capacity for feedback loops.\n\nKey learnings\n- Feedback loops can undermine mental health and contribute to anxiety disorders and depression.\n- The way we think about and describe our own mental health can unintentionally contribute to feedback loops.\n- Serotonergic drugs may be effective treatments for anxiety and depression because they alter the brain's feedback mechanisms.\n\nKey questions\n- Does the way we talk about mental health contribute to feedback loops?\n- What are the long-term effects of psychological diagnoses on mental health?\n- How do serotonergic drugs affect the brain's capacity for feedback loops?\n- Are there other factors that contribute to feedback loops in the brain?"
