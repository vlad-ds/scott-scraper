    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- The free energy principle says that all life is driven by the imperative to reduce the gulf between expectations and sensory inputs.\n- Perceptual control theory and free energy/predictive coding are fundamentally the same paradigm.\n- The author provides a glossary to help understand the concepts of prediction, expectation, set point, reference level, prediction error, surprise, active inference, and behavior as control of perception.\n- Perceptual control theory uses more intuitive terms than free energy/predictive coding, which can be confusing.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Free energy/predictive coding grew out of an account of world-modeling, while perceptual control theory explains movement, motivation, and desire.\n- FE/PC terminology should be kept, but PCT terminology can be taught as a learning aid.\n\nKey questions:\n- How come everyone uses the FE/PC formulation instead of the PCT formulation since PCT has more advantages?\n- Is Powers' explanation of world-modeling the same as FE/PC?\n- Could it be possible to construct a PCT look at world-modeling?"
