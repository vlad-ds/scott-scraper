    "summary": "Key ideas\n- People who took the SSC survey rated their experience with psychotherapy and medication with a 5.7 on average.\n- Only 7% of people had ever been involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital out of those who had seen a psychiatrist or therapist.\n- People liked doing therapy from books the most, followed by in-person therapy and online therapy apps the least.\n- People with bipolar and ADHD were happier with medication than therapy while alcoholics preferred therapy.\n- Autistic people strongly prefer medication perhaps due to hating the social interaction involved in therapy.\n\nKey learnings\n- None of the numbers measure whether treatment works, just whether patients were happy.\n- All results are vulnerable to selection effects and biases.\n\nKey questions\n- What percent of people engaging with the mental health system ended up inpatient based on the survey results?\n- Why did autistics prefer medication over therapy?\n- Why did people strongly prefer doing therapy from books compared to online therapy apps?"
