    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- The author provides three examples where there has to be a tradeoff, and someone has to lose.\n- In each example, the author feels that the party that \"loses\" has nominated themselves to do so.\n- The author's intuitions about who should \"lose\" don't always align with utilitarianism.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Sometimes, despite good intentions, a tradeoff must be made, and someone will be worse off.\n- The author's moral intuitions about who should \"lose\" in such situations differ from utilitarianism.\n\nKey questions:\n- What are the consequences of dismissing these situations as misfirings of the \"consequences of actions\" heuristic?\n- Is the idea that people can \"reveal their true preferences\" always accurate?\n- Is the desire to let people who make bad choices suffer just a utilitarian justification crystallized into a moral principle, or is it a distinct moral principle?"
