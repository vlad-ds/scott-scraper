    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Gilens and Page's study finds that elite support is a stronger predictor of policy implementation than popular support\n- Rationalist Conspiracy's post argues that money doesn't matter in politics\n- Ansolabehere, Figueiredo, and Snyder's study shows little relationship between money and legislator votes\n- These conclusions are dissonant as they appear to contradict each other\n\nKey learnings:\n- Legislators may vote based on their personal opinions or based on their desire to be seen as elite\n- Elites may have influence over legislators through indirect means, such as controlling the media or funding think tanks and lobbyists\n- The relationship between elite opinion and successful policies may be a coincidence\n\nKey questions:\n- How can we reconcile the dissonant findings of these studies?\n- What are the reasons for the apparent contradiction between the studies?\n- How does the role of money in politics affect policy implementation?"
