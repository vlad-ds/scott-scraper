    "summary": "Key ideas\n- A prestigious psychiatrist gave a standard response to psychotic patients that the author finds kind but not effective.\n- The author distinguishes between responding to someone with hallucinations and someone with delusions about their identity.\n- Psychotic individuals often ask psychiatrists whether they believe them, and this can be one of the central things in their lives.\n- The author entertains a fantasy response of asking a patient, \"If you were me, would you believe it?\"\n- The author also discusses how to respond to the question \"Do you think I'm crazy?\" \n\nKey learnings\n- Responding to questions from psychotic patients can be tricky, as you don't want to validate their delusions.\n- Psychiatrists may be tempted to give an answer that is kind but ultimately condescending.\n- The author provides some alternative responses that depend on the patient's personality and individual case.\n\nKey questions\n- What should psychiatrists do when patients ask whether they believe their delusions?\n- Should psychiatrists respond differently to patients with hallucinations versus those with delusions?\n- How much should honesty play a role in psychiatrists' responses to such questions?\n- How can we help patients function even when they have persistent delusions?"
