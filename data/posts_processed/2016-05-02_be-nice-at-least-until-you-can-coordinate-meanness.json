    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Commenters on this blog have been shamed or attacked for perceived misdeeds, resulting in protesters objecting to the banning of involved commenters\n- The idea of \"be nice\" as an ethical decision procedure is flawed in certain situations\n- In rare cases, meanness is necessary, but it should be coordinated to be excusable\n- Coordinated meanness achieves the goal of safety and stability\n- Safe spaces can be understood as spaces that have coordinated meanness against anything that threatens the group\n\nKey learnings:\n- Uncoordinated meanness is not excusable\n- Coordination of meanness is better than uncoordinated meanness as it is less common and ensures safety and stability\n- There are two things we want in a legal system: good laws that produce a just society and clear and predictable laws that produce a safe and stable society\n- Being nice should be balanced with the necessary meanness in coordination\n\nKey questions:\n- What are some other examples of coordinated versus uncoordinated meanness?\n- How do we determine which norms should be universally codified into law and which should be enforced through shame or shunning?\n- How do we balance the goals of justice and safety/stability in a legal system?"
