    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- There are multiple positions on the thermodynamics of weight gain.\n- Genetics and medications can have an effect on weight gain.\n- The most interesting debate is between the idea that basal metabolism is also involved in weight gain versus the idea that all of the interventions known to affect weight do it by affecting appetite and exercise drive.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Weight gain is not solely determined by calories in versus calories out.\n- Medications, genetics, and microbial makeup can have an impact on weight gain.\n- There is a debate on whether basal metabolism affects weight gain versus affecting appetite and exercise drive.\n\nKey questions:\n- Do genetics and microbial makeup disproportionately affect some people in an obesogenic environment?\n- Can individual people's metabolism change drastically and unexpectedly, and can green tea and other methods actually affect weight loss on a meaningful level?"
