    "summary": "Key ideas\n- The author objects to the broadening of the meaning of words like \u201cabuse\u201d and \u201clie\u201d.\n- Broadening the meaning of these words to include normal human failings decreases their power to separate strong examples from marginal ones.\n- The author argues that everyone being an \u201cabuser\u201d or a \u201cliar\u201d removes information that we can use to judge someone\u2019s character and future actions.\n- The new connotations of the words that are created in such a scenario can be exploited to ostracize people and silence them based on normal failings.\n\nKey learnings\n- It is important not to set the thresholds for category membership outside a distribution, or they will lose their power to convey useful information.\n- When words are used to name things that have a small level of the relevant quality, they should apply in more than 0% and less than 100% of cases.\n\nKey questions\n- Can broadening the definition of words like \u201cabuse\u201d or \u201clie\u201d help to fight abuse, bias, or misinformation?\n- Are there any other words whose meanings have shifted over time by being gradually applied more loosely?\n- How do we decide the right threshold for each individual concept? \n- What are the consequences of rebranding a functioning piece of language until it loses all meaning?"
