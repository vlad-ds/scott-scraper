    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Several readers have challenged the matching of the economic/population decline to the 'fall of Rome'.\n- Scott's rule of thumb for very poor societies is that the growth rate of population is a proxy for the average standard of living.\n- Different readers have different opinions on the start and end dates of the Dark Ages.\n- Lillian argues that the Carolingian Renaissance kind of fizzled out with the breakup of the Carolingian Empire.\n- Offwo2000 makes a fascinating claim that Christianity actually caused the recovery about AD 1000.\n- The lesson is that civilization is fragile. Civilization is something to be lovingly nurtured and ferociously guarded.\n\nKey learnings\n- The Dark Ages are not a period upon which the scholar can look with superior scorn.\n- Civilization is fragile. It's easy to think that the march of progress is inexorable, but it isn't.\n\nKey questions\n- What is the start and end date of the Dark Ages?\n- How can the growth rate of population be the only proxy for the average standard of living?\n- Did Christianity actually cause the recovery about AD 1000?"
