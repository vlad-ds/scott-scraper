    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Nathan Robinson argues against school vouchers as a solution to education issues.\n- Robinson argues that introducing profit into the school system is dangerous.\n- Robinson claims introducing profit creates a set of incentives that harms students.\n- Robinson suggests school vouchers will benefit mainly the wealthy.\n- The argument that private schools are obsessed with profit is focused on money and acknowledges that every dollar going to shareholders is a dollar not going to improving education or housing the homeless.\n- Though he disagrees with the specific arguments made about the virtues of vouchers, the author is concerned about the potential consequences of vouchers and charter schools in practice.\n- The author argues that vocational training, a renewed commitment to public schooling, and investing in early education would be better alternatives to vouchers.\n- School vouchers may be a good solution to improve education outcomes and reduce segregation in housing.\n- The lack of good competition is a major issue for industries such as education.\n- Allowing random people to open tiny schools could be a solution.\n- Home-schooled students do much better than traditionally schooled students.\n- The cost of schooling per student year can be reduced significantly.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Often criticism of the opponent's position is insufficient to change minds.\n- Expanding options for parents doesn't necessarily lead to better results for students.\n- Public education spending increased by 150% from 1970 to 2010 with unclear benefits.\n- The hospital case study indicates that for-profit hospitals are not noticeably better than not-for-profit ones.\n- It is unlikely that blatant kickbacks would be used with vouchers, but the author acknowledges the potential of schools emphasizing flashy advertising over substantive educational outcomes.\n- Vouchers could worsen class segregation and result in a lack of socioeconomic diversity in schools.\n- Let's experiment with school vouchers and different possibilities to understand and find a solution that works.\n- Lack of good competition is indeed the bane of all of these sorts of industries.\n- Allowing random people to open tiny schools can be a solution to the lack of competition.\n\nKey questions:\n- What is the conservative argument for school vouchers and how does Robinson respond?\n- How have college and primary education costs risen in the US without sufficient clarity on where the money went?\n- Do private schools also lose significant resources to inefficiency and bureaucracy like public schools?\n- What impact would vouchers have on educational outcomes for students from different socioeconomic backgrounds?\n- What are the potential unintended consequences of vouchers for public schooling?\n- How can the US improve the public schooling system without solely relying on vouchers and private institutions?\n- Can school vouchers destroy the incentive to overspend on/segregate housing in order to get into a \u201cgood school district\u201d?\n- Would school vouchers worsen the quality of education?\n- How much does lack of good competition matter in the education system?\n- Can allowing random people to open tiny schools improve education outcomes?\n- What is the solution to the high cost of schooling per student year?\n"
