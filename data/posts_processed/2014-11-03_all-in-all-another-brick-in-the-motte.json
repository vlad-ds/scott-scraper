    "summary": "Key ideas\n- The motte-and-bailey doctrine is a fallacy where a person makes a bold, controversial statement and then retreats to an obvious, uncontroversial statement when challenged, before returning to the bold statement.\n- Shackel's paper criticizes post-modernism and compares the doctrine to a medieval castle.\n- Examples of motte-and-bailey include religious groups, pseudoscience proponents, and some feminists.\n\nKey learnings\n- The motte-and-bailey doctrine draws its strength from people's failure to debate specific propositions rather than vague clouds of ideas.\n- Weak-manning is a lot like straw-manning, except that instead of debating a fake, implausibly stupid opponent, you're debating a real, unrepresentatively stupid opponent.\n- Tabooing words, then replacing the symbol with the substance can help with understanding what is actually being debated.\n\nKey questions\n- What is the real feminism we should be debating?\n- Who thinks it would be a good idea to associate a vague, poorly-defined concept like feminism with positive or negative affect?\n- How can we avoid falling prey to the motte-and-bailey doctrine in our own arguments and discussion?"
