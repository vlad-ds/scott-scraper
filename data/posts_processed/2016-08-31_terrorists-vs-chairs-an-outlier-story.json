    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Arguments comparing the danger of terrorism to other causes of death can be flawed if they rely on selectively chosen time intervals.\n- Although the risk of terrorism is relatively low, it is not a constant risk, and outliers such as rare but catastrophic events can be significant.\n- Similar considerations apply to other low-probability, high-consequence risks, such as nuclear terrorism or artificial intelligence.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Focusing on only the average statistics of rare events can be misleading or irrelevant.\n- Properly assessing risks requires considering the full distribution of potential outcomes, including extreme events.\n- Outliers can change the nature of a risk and make past observations irrelevant or misleading.\n\nKey questions:\n- How can we compare and prioritize risks that have different distributions of potential outcomes, with different probabilities and magnitudes of harm?\n- How can we prepare for unpredictable or extreme events, such as a terrorist using a nuclear weapon or unexpected consequences of new technologies?\n- How can we avoid letting rare events or media attention bias our perception of risks and distract from more common but less dramatic hazards?"
