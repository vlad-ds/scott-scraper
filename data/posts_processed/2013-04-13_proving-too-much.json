    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Proving Too Much is pointing out an argument's flaw in proving an obviously false conclusion.\n- The Dark Arts involve using arguments that can't be disproven within a specific time frame of the opponent.\n- The noncentral fallacy and Aristotelian view of concepts/objects can be easily used to perform the Dark Arts.\n\nKey learnings\n- Proving Too Much is an effective tool to cut complicated issues that may be irresolvable.\n- Using arguments that can't be disproven in a short amount of time is an effective technique in debates.\n- Proving Too Much can quickly and easily demolish subtle philosophical arguments.\n\nKey questions\n- How do you differentiate an argument that can be easily disproven from one that requires more time?\n- Is it possible to counter the Dark Arts? If so, how?\n- What are other techniques or fallacies that can help in debates, aside from Proving Too Much?"
