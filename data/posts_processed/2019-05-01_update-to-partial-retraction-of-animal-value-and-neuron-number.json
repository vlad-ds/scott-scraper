    "summary": "Key ideas\n- A previous survey showed that people's moral valuation of animals scaled with the number of cortical neurons.\n- A commenter did a larger survey and got different results, causing the author to retract the claim.\n- A new survey by David Moss found discrepancies in the results due to unclear procedures followed by the author.\n\nKey learnings\n- It is important to explain survey procedures clearly before attempting to replicate them.\n- It is important to ensure that links to survey procedures are accurate.\n\nKey questions\n- How can we ensure that survey results are accurate and reliable?\n- Is there a more objective way to measure the moral value of animals?"
