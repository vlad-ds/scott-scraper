    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Patients often search the internet for information on the adverse effects of drugs.\n- Unreliable websites such as EHealthMe, PatientsVille, and Treato tend to generate fake medical information.\n- Sites such as EHealthMe scrape the FDA databases to find information on possible side effects and run a program to produce ad-filled web pages about the drug.\n- A lot of the time, people stop taking medication because of side effects, which can be hard for doctors to manage.\n\nKey learnings:\n- The reliability of information on the internet about drug side effects should be questioned.\n- As much as possible, patients should seek advice from medical professionals before stopping medication due to side effects.\n- Patients should be informed about the availability of mental and emotional support and resources to cope with the side effects of medication.\n\nKey questions:\n- How can we ensure that patients have access to reliable medical information about the side effects of drugs?\n- What impact do unreliable medical websites have on the credibility of medical research?\n- Do patients have the necessary knowledge to differentiate between reliable medical information and fake medical information?"
