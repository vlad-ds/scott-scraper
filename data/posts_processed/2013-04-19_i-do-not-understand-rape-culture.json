    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- The author (Scott) is confused and skeptical of the term \"rape culture\"\n- Scott discusses five claims involved in \"rape culture\"\n- Scott argues against all of these claims, stating that they are diametrically wrong\n- The concept of a \"rape culture\" is invalid because American culture fixates largely on rape-related matters.\n- The comparatively low attention paid to Syrian Civil War as compared to Steubenville rape case is an example.\n- Cognitive bias applies to every type of crime.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Scott argues that society treats rape as a special kind of evil, worse than other crimes\n- The criminal justice system does not have a higher burden of proof in rape trials than in other trials\n- People giving well-intentioned but stupid advice to rape survivors is not unique to rape\n- People may overemphasize certain topics or issues over others, creating a culture of fixation rather than disregarding sensitive topics such as rape.\n- Cognitive bias regarding crime may be a factor.\n\nKey questions:\n- What are some good proposals for avoiding the difficulty of getting rape cases to trial?\n- Is sexual objectification of women causing the latent condoning/promotion of rape?\n- What does our fixation on rape-related topics say about our culture?\n- Is the concept of a \"rape culture\" adequately addressing how our culture views sexual assault?\n- To what extent are cognitive biases affecting modern discussions surrounding crime?\n"
