    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Study finds children placed in lead-reduction programs saw their risk of violent crime as adults drop by 66%.\n- Libertarianism is the rarest political orientation according to a study on economic vs. social politics.\n- Minimum wage increase in Seattle backfired and hurt poor workers, prompting debate.\n- NYT proposes larger districts with proportional representation as a solution to reduce political polarization and dysfunction.\n- Neural networks can generate Harry Potter fan fiction and perform deep reinforcement learning from human preferences.\n\nKey learnings:\n- There is bias in favor of women and minorities in hiring practices in Australia, and gender-blind or race-blind assessments cause more whites and men to be hired.\n- Roman concrete does outlast modern concrete, but it's not as simple as ancient wisdom being superior.\n- Corporate campaign contributions may not be significant in gaining political favors.\n\nKey questions:\n- What is the impact of weird accounting rules and oligopolies on the cost disease issue?\n- How does effectiveness in effective altruism relate to \"looking good\" versus actually doing good?\n- Is the perception of vision highly specific with no common factor, based on a study of illusion perception and personality?"
