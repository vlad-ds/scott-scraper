    "summary": "Key ideas\n- The author compares standardized test scores for residents in internal medicine, psychiatry, and surgery.\n- Individuals tend to learn the most in their first year and less every following year.\n- The author suggests that individual differences in intelligence and interest likely affect exam scores. \n\nKey learnings\n- Year of education is an important factor relative to individual differences but quickly becomes irrelevant.\n- People learn the most in their first year and less every following year.\n- Residents in a given specialty work about the same number of hours, see about the same sorts of patients, and yet still get very different scores on their exams.\n\nKey questions (Scott's questions)\n- Might it be a simple ceiling effect? \n- Might it be that final-year residents stop caring? \n- Might it be that programs stop teaching residents after three years or so? \n- Might it be that residents only learn by seeing patients and there's only a certain number of kinds of patients that they see regularly? \n- What is the reason for individuals to get very different scores on their exams in the same specialty?"
