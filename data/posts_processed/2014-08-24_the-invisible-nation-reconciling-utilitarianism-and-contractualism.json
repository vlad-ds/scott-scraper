    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- The Economists' Paradise is a world where all game-theoretic problems are solved and all transactions are honest and voluntary.\n- It is possible to use this paradigm to solve many real-world problems, such as world hunger and bullying.\n- The author argues that the State can be used to enforce moral laws if certain conditions are met.\n- The concept of Economists\u2019 Paradise, where rational agents in a perfect world make agreements that would work without exception.\n- The idea of the patchwork of agreements collapsing into a single pact as practical concerns arise.\n- The Economists\u2019 Paradise aims at solving coordination problems to keep everyone happy and prosperous and free.\n- The rules of the Economists' Paradise involve negotiation and adherence to agreements using good economist and game theory.\n- Good negotiation techniques would end in a multitude of possible good outcomes.\n- Negotiation techniques leading to extreme local minima where everything is Pareto-optimal but nobody is happy would lead everyone coordinating to sign a pact not to use those negotiation techniques.\n\nKey learnings:\n- The Economists' Paradise can be seen as a way to achieve an ideal world without wars or crime.\n- Clear rules and effective enforcement are necessary for the Economists' Paradise to work.\n- The State can be a powerful tool in enforcing moral laws, but tradeoffs must be considered.\n- Economists\u2019 Paradise might be sufficient to bridge the gap between Rawls' Veil of Ignorance and Utilitarians\u2019 Paradise.\n- The agreement that everyone or almost everyone would sign is important, leading to a utilitarianism-like approach.\n- Rules of the Economists' Paradise are hard to determine and enforce, and different techniques lead to different results.\n- Rules can be enforced by the State or voluntarily followed in the privacy of individuals.\n- Utilitarianism is one good heuristic for the rules, while contractualism solves some of utilitarianism's problems.\n- Inspirational values and practical wisdom are necessary to improve heuristics and rules.\n\nKey questions:\n- What are the challenges involved in convincing people to follow the rules necessary for the Economists' Paradise to work?\n- How can algorithmization of rules be used to prevent fallible human judgment from influencing enforcement?\n- What can be done to ensure that the State's enforcement of moral laws does not lead to tyranny or poor implementation?\n- How can the assumption of perfect coordination in Economists\u2019 Paradise be applied to other contexts?\n- Is there a way to solve bullying in the Least Convenient Possible World, assuming Economists\u2019 Paradise is valid?\n- How can the concept of Economists\u2019 Paradise bridge the gap between Utilitarians\u2019 Paradise and Rawls' Veil of Ignorance?\n- How do we ensure that different negotiation techniques yielding different results conform to the rules of the Economists' Paradise?\n- How do we effectively enforce rules that are hard to determine and enforce?\n- Can contractualism ultimately be a better alternative to utilitarianism?\n"
