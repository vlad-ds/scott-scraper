    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- A man who died in the Paris attacks, Orlando nightclub shooting, and Ataturk Airport attack has been identified as the same person.\n- A review of studies found no higher prevalence of eating disorders among fashion models compared to non-models.\n- Researchers have designed intelligences that will not resist their own shutdown in the field of AI safety.\n- China plans to cut meat consumption by 50%.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Efforts towards AI safety have led researchers to design intelligences that will not resist their own shutdown.\n- Nominal agreement between initial studies and meta-analyses conveys literally zero evidence about whether something is true or not in psychiatry.\n- The first fully automated fast-food restaurant has been launched in San Francisco.\n\nKey questions:\n- What is the mysterious man who dies in every terrorist attack?\n- How can researchers design intelligences that will not resist their own shutdown in the field of AI safety?\n- How do we reconcile behavioral genetics with attachment theory?\n- Why is there ever conflict in gains from trade, and why don\u2019t people just Aumann-agree on how the conflict would probably go?"
