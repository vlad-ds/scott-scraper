    "summary": "Key ideas\n- The World Cup has overly complicated advancement procedures.\n- The author wonders if these procedures could create a primitive neural net.\n- The payoff matrix heavily penalizes losing over tying and winning over tying.\n- Both teams may benefit from establishing a mutually beneficial equilibrium of not scoring goals.\n\nKey learnings\n- The World Cup has weird incentive structures.\n- The author enjoys following these complicated procedures.\n- Teams may benefit from communicating to establish mutually beneficial equilibrium.\n- The establishment of a government to enforce a Platonic social contract and virtuous behavior is a solution to incentive problems.\n\nKey questions\n- How complicated do the advancement rules have to be before the tournament acts as a sort of primitive neural net?\n- Could a sufficiently large soccer tournament achieve sentience and feel suffering?\n- Can both teams establish a mutually beneficial equilibrium of not scoring goals?\n- Can such a plan be enforced against the temptation to defect and score a goal at the last second for national glory?"
