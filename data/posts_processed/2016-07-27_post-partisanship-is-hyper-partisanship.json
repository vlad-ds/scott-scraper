    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Outgroup vs. ingroup is defined by proximity plus small differences\n- Fargroups are people who don't threaten us or aren't in competition with us\n- As threat of an outgroup declines, they become more like a fargroup and are exoticized\n- Partisan bubbles create hyperpartisanism and factions within political parties\n- People start treating Trump and Brexit voters as interesting and worthy of respect, rather than an outgroup\n\nKey learnings:\n- The way we view groups is influenced by how close they are to us and the threat they pose\n- Our view of outgroups can shift as threat decreases or our priorities change\n- Partisan bubbles can lead to further polarization within political parties\n\nKey questions:\n- How should we approach outgroups versus fargroups?\n- What can we do to prevent polarization within political parties and promote collaboration?\n- How can we shift our perspective of groups to see them as individuals rather than part of a stereotyped group?"
