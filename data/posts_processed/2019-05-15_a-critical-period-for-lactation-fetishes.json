    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Enquist et al studied lactation fetishes to understand how people develop fetishes\n- They theorized that sexual imprinting during critical childhood years can lead to fetishes\n- They found that people with younger siblings have more lactation fetishes, supporting their critical window theory\n- Scott questions whether birth order effects on openness to experience can explain Enquist et al's findings\n\nKey learnings:\n- Enquist et al's critical window theory on fetishes may be explained by birth order effects on openness to experience\n- Having a younger sibling does not necessarily increase the likelihood of developing baby-related fetishes\n\nKey questions:\n- How do people develop fetishes and what are the factors that contribute to their formation?\n- How do critical childhood years affect sexual imprinting and fetish development?\n- Can birth order effects on openness to experience explain some of the variations in fetish prevalence among individuals?\n- If Enquist et al's findings are due to birth order effects, what implications does it have for our understanding of fetish development?"
