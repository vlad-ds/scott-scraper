    "summary": "Key ideas\n- There are several factors that seem to be involved in causing depression, including life adversity, inflammation, monoamines, glutamate, folate, and electricity.\n- Synaptogenesis is the process by which healthy neurons create new dendrites and synapses to expand their network of connections.\n- Depressed people have less synaptogenesis going on, and synaptogenesis is partly controlled by a protein complex called mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1).\n- The factors that affect synaptogenesis and mTORC are many of the same factors that affect depression.\n\nKey learnings\n- The synapse hypothesis can unify at least five of the six lines of research into the causes of depression.\n- Decreased synaptogenesis could contribute to a functional disconnection and loss of normal control of mood and emotion in depression.\n- There are still several questions that need to be answered, including why decreased synaptogenesis causes depression, why can't people just be given BDNF for depression, why the body has so many \"decrease synaptogenesis\" knobs, and how bipolar disorder fits into all of this.\n\nKey questions\n- Why should decreased synaptogenesis cause depression, of all things?\n- Why can\u2019t we just give people BDNF for depression?\n- Why does the body have so many \u201cdecrease synaptogenesis\u201d knobs?\n- Why is depression an episodic disease?\n- How does bipolar disorder fit into all of this?\n- What is a good evolutionary theory of depression?"
