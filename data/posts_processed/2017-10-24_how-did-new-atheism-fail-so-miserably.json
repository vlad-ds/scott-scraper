    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- New Atheism has lost its battle for the cultural high ground.\n- The problem with New Atheism was that its whole shtick was repeating obviously true things that everyone already knew.\n- New Atheism preached to educated urban liberal spaces, where they were essentially telling people what they already believed.\n- Contemporary intellectual culture, especially progressive movements, regurgitates its beliefs for the warm glow of being told they are correct.\n- Progressivism turned against New Atheism for doing the same thing, which was repeating platitudes back to progressives.\n\nKey learnings:\n- New Atheism failed to make a case for its social importance like other popular movements have.\n- The movement didn't stay relevant enough to sustain the popular support.\n- The New Atheists were bad at sounding empathetic compared to other popular movements.\n\nKey questions:\n- How did the New Atheists lose their popular support?\n- What did the other progressive movements do that made them sustain popular opinion?\n- Can New Atheism make a comeback?"
