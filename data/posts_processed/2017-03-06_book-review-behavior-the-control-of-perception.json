    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Psychology has historically been defined by individual paradigm-shifting figures, but now relies more on smaller studies.\n- Will Powers created Perceptual Control Theory, which posits that the brain is made up of control systems.\n- Powers' theory suggests that everything we do is based on control systems, from maintaining a desired temperature to driving a car.\n- Powers' theory also posits that there is a hierarchy of control systems, from muscle tension to abstract concepts like communism or family values.\n- Perceptual control theory proposes that everything can be understood as a control system.\n- Control systems have tiers, and higher level tiers are controlling lower level tiers.\n- The author questions the validity of this idea and the testable consequences of it.\n- A theory of learning based on control systems is presented as an improvement over behaviorism.\n\nKey learnings:\n- The brain is fundamentally made up of control systems that change muscle tension.\n- There is a hierarchy of control systems that operate at different levels of abstraction.\n- Tremors and other movement disorders can be understood as failures in control systems.\n- We switch effortlessly between focusing on low-level concepts and high-level concepts that make the low-level ones automatic.\n- Control systems can involve a predictable flowchart-like set of actions to achieve a simple goal.\n- Perceptual control-based theories of learning involve reward and punishment that reduce or increase error in control systems.\n\nKey questions:\n- How does Powers' theory account for more complex behavior, such as decision-making or creativity?\n- How can Powers' theory be tested in a way that is more rigorous than anecdotal evidence?\n- Are there limitations to understanding the brain strictly in terms of control systems?\n- Is the concept of higher-tier control systems unproveable and unfalsifiable?\n- Is there a sense in which communism is a control system?\n- How useful is the metaphor of the brain as a control system?\n"
