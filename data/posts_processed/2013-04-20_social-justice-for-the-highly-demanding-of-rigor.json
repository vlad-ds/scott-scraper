    "summary": "Key ideas\n- The author discusses the Reactionary argument, which states that social justice advocates assume racism or sexism is the cause of every undesirable outcome in minority groups without considering other possibilities.\n- The author provides counterarguments and discusses studies and experiments that show discrimination in hiring and housing, and lower-income among minority groups.\n- The author estimates that the economic costs of racism and sexism in the US is around $438 billion per year.\n\nKey learnings\n- Implicit Association Tests show that a significant percentage of white Americans and black Americans have implicit racial preference for whites.\n- In controlled experiments where white and black candidates are matched based on similar qualifications, looks, and age, white candidates are offered jobs more often than black candidates, even when they are equally qualified.\n- Discrimination in hiring and housing costs minorities significant financial losses.\n\nKey questions\n- How can social justice advocates be more rigorous in testing anti-racism and anti-sexism strategies?\n- What other non-monetary costs are not included in the estimated costs of US racism and sexism?\n- What can be done to decrease racism and sexism more effectively?"
