    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Right-wing policies and systems are those selected by cultural evolution, while left-wing policies and systems are selected by the marketplace of ideas.\n- Under this definition, fascism, communism, and liberalism are all left-wing ideas.\n- Dictatorships may be more effective than democracies at implementing right-wing policies due to their ability to resist pressure from activists and the masses.\n- Creating a system conducive to cultural evolution, with a patchwork of small countries ruled by absolute dictators, could be a way to guarantee that a collection of countries works well.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Humans are bad at designing effective institutions and organizations, so it's better to create \"variation and selection systems\" that allow alternative institutions or organizational forms to compete.\n- Memetic evolution gets faster and faster, resulting in the spread of convincing-sounding but false ideas.\n- Cultural evolution may be a counterweight to memetic evolution, and understanding its role can help increase its influence in case of emergency.\n\nKey questions: \n- What prevents every democracy from instantly becoming maximally left-wing?\n- Would dictatorships really be higher variance than democracies?\n- Would cultural evolution at the international level work quickly enough to be humane?\n- How can we raise the sanity waterline and make true things more convincing than false things?"
