    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- People tend to get upset over the violation of already-settled bright-line norms because they want to use limited enforcement resources efficiently.\n- The international community made a credible commitment to punish chemical weapons use, and it's worked so far.\n- A fixed amount of public outrage per news cycle is the same kind of \u201climited enforcement resource\u201d as only having ten police officers; commit to using it to disproportionately enforce existing taboos, and you\u2019ll have more of it left over later on.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Prioritizing responding to violations of established norms could help to enforce these norms more effectively in the future.\n- Credible commitments to enforce norms can deter individuals from violating them.\n\nKey questions:\n- Why do people tend to get upset over the violation of already-settled bright-line norms?\n- What are some examples of established norms and bright-line rules?\n- How can societies solidify norms and enforce strong commitments to them?"
