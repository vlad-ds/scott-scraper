    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Conservative Protestantism is thriving while liberal Protestantism is dying.\n- Arbitrary demands and restrictions in conservative religious groups can make them stronger.\n- Demanding rituals serve as hard-to-fake symbols of commitment that keep only the most committed members in the group.\n- Liberal Protestant churches often end up having a lot of half-committed believers in their pews, which weakens the community.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Churches that demand real sacrifice of their members are stronger because they have built-in tools to eliminate people with weaker commitments.\n- Members of religious communities that follow demanding rituals and onerous requirements are more caring and generous with each other.\n\nKey questions:\n- Why are liberal Protestant churches failing while conservative ones are thriving?\n- Why do demanding rituals and rules serve as hard-to-fake symbols of commitment?\n- Why are there no effective atheist religion-substitutes that have strict rules or requirements for their members?"
