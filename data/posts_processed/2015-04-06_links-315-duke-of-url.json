    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Europe\u2019s Little Ice Age may be a myth as temperature records don\u2019t show much of a decline during that period.\n- New book by Peter Singer, The Most Good You Can Do: How Effective Altruism Is Changing Ideas About Living Ethically, to be released soon.\n- Libyan intervention was a mistake.\n- The rich donate proportionally less to charity than the poor because they are so isolated.\n- Artificial sweeteners may cause weight gain as they change the balance between Bacteroides and Firmicutes bacteria in the gut.\n- Many Mohawk Indians are scared of heights but hide it due to cultural teaching.\n- Poorer people have smaller brains than wealthier people, even at one month old.\n- A lot of modern inequality arises from the cost of housing.\n- Trying to lose weight leads to a 15% reduction in all-cause mortality.\n\nKey learnings\n- Temperature records don't support the idea of Europe's Little Ice Age.\n- Singer's new book advocates for effective altruism.\n- The Libyan intervention was a mistake.\n- The rich are more isolated and hence donate proportionally lesser to charity.\n- Artificial sweeteners have the potential to cause obesity.\n- Cultural teaching might lead to hiding of personal fears.\n- Housing is a major contributor to modern inequality.\n- Losing weight has considerable benefits.\n\nKey questions\n- Is Europe's Little Ice Age truly a myth?\n- Can effective altruism change ideas about living ethically?\n- Was the Libyan intervention a mistake?\n- Why do the rich donate proportionally less to charity?\n- What is the exact mechanism through which artificial sweeteners cause weight gain?\n- How and why do cultural teachings influence personal behavior?\n- How can the cost of housing be addressed?\n- How important is losing weight to leading a healthy lifestyle?"
