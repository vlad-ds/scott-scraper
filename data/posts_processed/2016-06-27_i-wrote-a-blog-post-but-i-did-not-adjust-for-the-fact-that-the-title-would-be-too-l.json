    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Psychoanalysts have proposed that we should be looking at effects that depend disproportionately on the father, to test for genuine parent effects.\n- A correlational study of 6000 kids age 14-24 found that among all participants, better relationships led to less disordered eating, increased physical activity, and better sleep.\n- Among female but not male participants, better relationships decrease fast food consumption.\n- The odds ratio for obesity with a good father-son relationship was 0.80, confidence level (0.66, 0.98), indicating fathers' unique ability to affect male children's level of obesity.\n\nKey learnings\n- Young adults who grew up in stable families with quality parental relationships were more likely to have healthy diet, activity, and sleep behaviours, and were less likely to be obese.\n- Fathers have a unique ability to affect their sons' (but not their daughters') level of obesity.\n\nKey questions\n- Do the study results suggest that parents care more about their daughters eating fast food than their sons?\n- How should multiple comparisons be adjusted in these types of studies? \n- Does anyone know of any good studies showing gender-specific-parent effects on a child that don\u2019t seem obviously related to intrauterine or Y-chromosomal factors?"
