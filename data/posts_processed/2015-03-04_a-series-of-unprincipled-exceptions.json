    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Many people believe that animals have some moral value, but it is difficult to value them in a way that makes them moderately important.\n- Effective altruists should focus entirely on animal-related charities if they want to achieve the most good per unit resource.\n- Widening circles of concern is a process that many utilitarians go through, which involves including progressively more people/animals in one's moral considerations.\n- It is difficult to treat all individuals with equal importance within a given circle of concern (e.g. treating strangers as equally important as friends).\n\nKey learnings\n- Valuing animals in a way that doesn't make their suffering astronomically more important than that of humans is difficult.\n- Effective altruists should prioritize animal-related charities if they want to maximize their impact.\n- Completing the process of widening circles of concern can be scary, but effective altruists are selected for not shying away from it.\n- It is difficult to treat all individuals with equal importance within a given circle of concern.\n\nKey questions\n- How do we value animals in a way that doesn't make their suffering astronomically more important than that of humans?\n- Should effective altruists focus entirely on animal-related charities, or is there value in considering the welfare of humans as well?\n- How can we treat all individuals with equal importance within a given circle of concern?"
