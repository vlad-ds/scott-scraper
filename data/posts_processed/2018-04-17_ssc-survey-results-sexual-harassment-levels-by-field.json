    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- There is little credible research on how rates of sexual harassment differ by occupation type.\n- The variation in survey results of sexual harassment rates appears to be dependent on how questions are asked.\n- Investigations are needed that use the same methodology across multiple fields.\n- The narrative of women being driven out of technology due to harassment by men is not supported by data.\n- The rate at which men and women choose tech courses in high school parallels the rate at which they go into tech occupations.\n- Gender balance in fields is not predicted by harassment levels in those fields.\n\nKey learnings:\n- STEM and male-dominated fields have the least harassment rates.\n- Industries that rank low in EEOC data tend to be small industries with very few women.\n- Respondents to the Slate Star Codex survey reported much more sexual harassment outside of work than in it.\n- Narrative and anecdotal evidence should not be considered as reliable as scientific evidence.\n- It is important to be skeptical of experiments that confirm an unusual opinion until they are verified by other sources.\n- Raw survey data should be made available to the public to encourage replication of conclusions.\n\nKey questions:\n- Why do numbers of sexual harassment differ so dramatically in surveys, and what is the most important issue?\n- Is media coverage of high-profile industries in terms of sexual harassment mistargeted?\n- How do we reconcile the media's claims that STEM fields are uniquely unwelcoming to women with the data that shows they have lower harassment rates?\n- How can we encourage more good research to be done on the topic of gender imbalance in technology and other fields?\n- What other narratives or anecdotal evidence about gender imbalance should we be skeptical of until they are supported by scientific evidence?\n- How can we effectively communicate the importance of scientific evidence in shaping our understanding of social issues?\n"
