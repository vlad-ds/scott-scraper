    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Academics who attribute the woes of Third World countries to colonization often go beyond what the facts support.\n- The paradox of upper-class ethnic-majority Westerners attempting to find reasons why lots of things are the fault of ethnic-majority Westerners.\n- An explanation for this paradox is that people feel a strong need to help the less-advantaged and come up with a justification that is accurate or not.\n- Moral Therapeutic Deontology is a deontological system that focuses on following certain rules rather than the importance of charity.\n- Utilitarianism tells us that we are justified seeing the relief of suffering as a pressing need.\n\nKey learnings:\n- People feel a need to help the less-advantaged and come up with a justification that may not be factually accurate to do so.\n- Deontological systems may focus on following certain rules rather than the importance of charity.\n- Utilitarianism justifies seeing the relief of suffering as a pressing need, without requiring an inaccurate justification.\n\nKey questions:\n- What is the difference between deontological and utilitarian ethics, and how do they relate to Moral Therapeutic Deontology?\n- How might utilitarianism be used to justify helping the poor without needing to posit inaccurate facts?\n- What is the impact of colonialism theory on people's interest in helping the poor, and how might utilitarianism offer an alternative perspective?"
