    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- The Federalist released a report on sexual assault rates on campuses that disputes the \"one in five\" statistic and argues that non-students are more likely to be victims of sexual assault than students.\n- The author argues that one cannot directly compare per year sexual assault rates to per college career sexual assault rates.\n- Confirmation bias occurs not only when people believe every study that supports their views, but also when people believe every supposed refutation that supports their views.\n- Saying that a study has been \"debunked\" or \"refuted\" often appeals to authority and shuts out evidence that challenges beliefs.\n- The discrepancy between different campus rape surveys is due partly to response bias and partly to different definitions of \"sexual assault\".\n\nKey learnings:\n- Academics can be just as divided as anyone else on issues, and their arguments can be just as acrimonious as anyone else's.\n- Every study has flaws and no study has perfect methodology.\n- One should be cautious about accepting arguments from authority or selectively acknowledging studies that support one's own views.\n- Different studies that contradict each other may be valid depending on how they define their terms.\n\nKey questions:\n- What are some examples of things that have been \"well-refuted\" and \"debunked\"?\n- When is it appropriate to claim that a study has been debunked or refuted?\n- How does confirmation bias function in academia, and what does this mean for the validity of research?"
