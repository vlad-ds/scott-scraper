    "summary": "Key ideas\n- The author wrote a blog post to encourage readers to consider their beliefs in the context of a thought experiment.\n- The thought experiment asks what beliefs would survive if everything the individual once knew was inverted.\n- The author explores this idea with slavery, vegetarianism and Christianity.\n- A commenter adds to the discussion, proposing to observe how your beliefs stand up to the imagined standards of others.\n\nKey learnings\n- Applying the thought experiment with standards instead of rational beliefs can be dangerous, but insightful.\n- It's helpful to think about the relationship between the standards we hold ourselves to and the perceived standards of others.\n- It's important to consider how our beliefs would change if we were presented with entirely different realities.\n\nKey questions\n- Which beliefs of yours would survive the thought experiment?\n- Do you think that the thought experiment is valuable or too dangerous?\n- How can we adjust our standards to better ourselves and our beliefs?"
