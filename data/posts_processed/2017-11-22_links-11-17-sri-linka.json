    "summary": "Key ideas \n- Byzantine con man Paul Palaiologos Tagaris was appointed an Orthodox bishop, pretended to be Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem, switched from Greek Orthodoxy to Roman Catholicism and back again, supported the See of Rome and the Avignon anti-popes in the Western Schism, and managed to be named Latin Patriarch of Constantinople.\n- The Canadian FDA-equivalent bans meal substitute Soylent for violating standards.\n- The FDA is trying to ban kratom, which people use for chronic pain treatment or to overcome opiate addiction. Conspiracy theorists note that Scott Gottlieb, the Trump's FDA head, took $100,000 from GlaxoSmithKline, which is working on a synthetic patent-protected kratom version that will become people\u2019s only option if the real thing is banned.\n- Insulin prices have increased by ten times in the past twenty years. The Trump administration just nominated a man whose company tripled the price of insulin to regulate drug companies. \n- A group of scientists launch Genomic Prediction, a company that uses genetic testing to select embryos for IVF.\n- Stuart Ritchie and Elliot Tucker-Drob meta-analyzed how much education improves intelligence. They concluded that it is positive and significant.\n- The Open Philanthropy Project gives MIRI its largest grant of $3.75 million.\n- UN warns that Yemen is facing the largest famine the world has seen in decades.\n- Christians are boycotting British food producer Greggs for making a nativity scene with a sausage roll as Jesus.\n\nKey learnings \n- There is a ban on Soylent for not meeting standards, and the FDA is trying to ban kratom.\n- Prices of insulin have risen ten times, and the Trump administration has nominated someone to regulate drug companies who tripled the prices of insulin in his previous position.\n- MIRI receives the largest grant in its history.\n- Yemen is facing a major humanitarian crisis.\n- Christians are upset about a depiction of Jesus made of a sausage roll.\n\nKey questions \n- Why did the Canadian FDA-equivalent ban Soylent? \n- What is the significance of the FDA's attempt to ban kratom?\n- How can insulin prices rise so much in twenty years, and how will this impact diabetics? \n- What are the implications of using embryo selection to promote positively valued, heritable traits such as intelligence?\n- Why are Christians so upset about the Greggs nativity scene?"
