    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- The decline of 90s environmentalism has led to a lack of concern about issues such as air and water pollution, acid rain, and rainforest destruction.\n- Environmentalists successfully addressed air and water pollution through legislation and decreased emissions.\n- The issue of acid rain was partially solved through emissions reductions, but its effects still linger in some ecosystems.\n- The state of the world's rainforests is difficult to evaluate, but some data suggests that they are decreasing in size.\n- Environmental concerns from the 90s are addressed one by one, and their veracity is investigated\n- Concerns of deforestation, endangered species, peak resources, trash piling up, and saving the whales are discussed\n- The author uses examples, data, and verifiable sources to determine the validity of each environmental issue\n- The author reflects on how some environmental issues that were once alarmingly real seem to have faded away without any definitive solutions.\n- The author questions whether the shift in public opinion came from top-down or bottom-up processes.\n- The author wonders whether climate change has cannibalized focus on other environmental problems.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Environmental movements can successfully solve some problems, but it may lead to a lack of concern around the issue.\n- Some environmental issues have been exaggerated, which can lead to misguided efforts.\n- Deforestation still exists as a problem, with Southeast Asia showing no significant decrease\n- The issue of endangered species could be partly alarmist, as many species extinction rates are lower than believed\n- The worry of the Earth becoming a mountain of trash is alarmist and no longer considered a significant problem\n- Peak resource concerns have been put to rest due to new extraction technologies\n- Whaling is reducing, but indigenous peoples and certain countries still permit it\n- Environmental issues are constructed and the mapping from real crisis to social panic is tenuous, contingent, and historical.\n- Just because an environmental issue fades away doesn't mean it has been solved or debunked.\n- Public attention often moves on from environmental issues after a decade or so.\n\nKey questions:\n- What other environmental issues have been affected by the decline of 90s environmentalism?\n- How can environmentalists communicate the urgency of issues without resorting to alarmism?\n- Is public concern necessary for environmental issues to be addressed effectively?\n- How can we raise awareness of world issues without resorting to alarmism?\n- What steps can we take to address deforestation in Southeast Asia and preserve endangered species?\n- How can we ensure that global consensus and regulations against whaling are enforced and upheld?\n- How did non-environmental problems fade away, and why have these made-up environmental issues, which never had an intellectual defeat, lost public attention over time?\n- Was the change bottom-up, or did the intellectuals initiate it?\n- Has public attention on global warming cannibalized other environmental issues?\n"
