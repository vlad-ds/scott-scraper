    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Contractualism attempts to derive morality from an agreement that selfish agents would willingly sign.\n- Rawls' \"veil of ignorance\" thought experiment helps to get us closer to utilitarianism.\n- A society of 100 men with varying strength levels and a god enforcing agreements is used to explore oppressive interactions.\n- A hierarchy of agreement banning certain types of oppression is proposed, but it ultimately fails due to people's self-interest.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Real-life power differentials affect moral standards and utility ratios.\n- One-size-fits-all utilitarianism can be replaced by power-based utility ratios.\n- Hierarchies of agreements have flaws in the face of self-interest and the inability to predict others' actions.\n\nKey questions:\n- How can superrational bases be established for cooperation in situations like the iterated 100 prisoners dilemma and the society of 100 men?\n- Would adding a coalition agreement to gang up against opponents change the outcome of the oppressive interaction model?"
