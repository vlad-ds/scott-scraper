    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Sleep medications are often either dangerous or ineffective.\n- Ramelteon is a sleep medication that selectively binds to melatonin receptors.\n- Melatonin is a natural hormone that is available as an over-the-counter supplement and is safe and effective at promoting sleep.\n- A head-to-head trial between Ramelteon and melatonin has never been performed.\n- The lack of availability of melatonin in hospitals is a concerning reflection of how basic and useful human hormones can be excluded from medicine.\n\nKey learnings\n- Melatonin is a natural hormone that promotes sleep and is available as an over-the-counter supplement.\n- Ramelteon is a sleep medication that selectively binds to melatonin receptors and is safe and effective at promoting sleep.\n- It is uncertain whether Ramelteon or melatonin is more effective at promoting sleep because a head-to-head trial has never been performed.\n- The lack of availability of melatonin in hospitals is concerning because it reflects how basic and useful human hormones can be excluded from medicine.\n\nKey questions\n- Why did Ramelteon need to be created if melatonin is safe, effective, and readily available?\n- Why has there not been a head-to-head trial between Ramelteon and melatonin?\n- How can basic and useful human hormones like melatonin be excluded from medicine?"
