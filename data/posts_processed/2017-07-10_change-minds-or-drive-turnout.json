    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Democrats believe that moving towards the center will make them electable.\n- Halls & Thompson (2017) found that the more extreme a candidate, the lower their party\u2019s share of total turnout.\n- Hall and Thomspon also concluded that effects on turnout might be the entire reason why extremist candidates do worse.\n- There is little data on vote-switching, but CNN's exit poll from 2008 suggests that 17% of people who voted Republican in 2004 went Democrat in 2008.\n- Nate Cohn of the New York Times found that white working-class Obama supporters switched to Trump, and that shifts in turnout were not the dominant factor in Trump\u2019s success among white working-class voters.\n\nKey learnings\n- Extreme candidates tend to do worse in elections.\n- Base voter turnout is important, but swing voters can make a big difference in close elections.\n- Moving towards the center may not be the best tactic for the Democrats to win elections.\n\nKey questions\n- Do more extreme views increase base turnout?\n- Is base turnout really the only thing that matters?\n- How do swing voters compare to base turnout as a determining factor in elections?\n- Can a candidate appeal to the base and swing voters at the same time without compromising their principles?"
