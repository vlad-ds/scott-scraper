    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- A patient wants her son to take care of her, but he is not keen because it's a full-time job.\n- The mother feels that her son owes her because she sacrificed more for him than he will ever have to for her.\n- The same concept applies to the argument that individuals owe a debt to society.\n- The idea of handing society a blank check for anything they want out of individuals is scary.\n- The 'Giving What We Can' rule of giving 10% of income to charity is a finite amount that individuals could comply with.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Infinite debts make everyone miserable and tend to not be paid at all.\n- There needs to be a socially sanctioned middle ground for determining a level of debt, which individuals can manage without ruining their lives.\n\nKey questions:\n- How far does the concept of owing a debt to someone or something go?\n- What is the practical and moral answer to the concept of an infinite debt?\n- How can individuals determine a socially sanctioned middle ground for their debts?"
