    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Multiocular O, a rare Cyrillic letter, is used only to describe the eyes of seraphim\n- Low-Trust Russia: Russian Who Wants To Be A Millionaire contestants might avoid asking audience members for help as they may mislead them\n- Xenocrypt on the math of economic geography and the significance of voting districts\n- Facebook is planning a fundraising tool similar to GoFundMe\n- A\u2019Lee Frost's experience at the Left Forum convention\n- The survival of cells that are growing too old can partly reverse aging\n- Pope John XIX ruled from 1024-1032; Pope John XXI ruled from 1276-1277 due to the Catholic Church getting confused\n- The author discusses two important reasons why many jobs in the construction industry go unfilled.\n- The author presents a case of Roscoe Arbuckle as an example of how it doesn't matter what the justice system finds if the industry is controlled by people happy to blacklist you for being unpopular.\n- The US Supreme Court rejects the argument that states can keep certain suspects' money even after they are found innocent.\n- A study found that mandatory class attendance policies in college decrease grades by preventing students from making rational decisions about when and how to study.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Never assume that between-populations genetic variation is more significant for height than for cognitive abilities\n- It's unethical to make available an AI project like Lyrebird that can read off any text wanted in a person's voice\n- A decision to protest with silly costumes and funny signs could reflect on subconsciously not believing the issue is that bad\n- A strict constructionism approach to law is better than a living law for preventing pro-corporate decisions\n- There is no shortage of qualified STEM workers relative to other fields\n- The construction industry has a shortage of skilled workers due to two major reasons, economic and political.\n- The legal system can fail a person even if they are found innocent if the industry they work in has people willing to blacklist them for being unpopular.\n- The US Supreme Court ruling sets a strong precedent that could be utilized to curb civil forfeiture, an important issue.\n- Mandatory class attendance policies may not be beneficial for students.\n\nKey questions:\n- Do Russian Who Wants To Be A Millionaire contestants avoid asking audience members because they expect audience members to deliberately mislead them?\n- Why is Siberian Fox so opposed to the idea of between-populations genetic variation in cognitive abilities?\n- Does making an AI project available like Lyrebird raise awareness of the potential risk or put people at a higher risk?\n- What does the idea of a decision to wear silly costumes and funny signs at a march say about our beliefs around the issue being protested?\n- How is it possible for an efficient market to cause construction companies to not be able to find unskilled laborers willing to work for high salaries?\n- Why do many jobs in the construction industry go unfilled despite the industry's need for skilled workers?\n- How can we ensure that justice is served and innocent individuals are not blacklisted by the industry?\n- What else can be done to address the issue of civil forfeiture?\n- How can attendance policies in college be redesigned to not hinder students' overall grades?\n"
