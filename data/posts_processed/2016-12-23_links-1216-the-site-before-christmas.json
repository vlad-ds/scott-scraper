    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Jews should avoid some specific areas in the Pacific that are confusing for observing Shabbat.\n- Private hospitals and public hospitals are equally good (bad) in India but private hospitals are only 1/4 as expensive. \n- Several arguments for and against the effectiveness of earlier school starting ages. \n- Investigative journalism reports private mental hospitals admitting non-hospitalization needing patients to profit their business.\n- The collapse of the Soviet Union led to mild food shortages in Cuba, leading to the country being a natural laboratory for health benefits of losing weight. \n\nKey learnings\n- Bias in mainstream news sources are not as pronounced as we think but a few outlets with obviously biased leanings such as Daily Kos and Breitbart. \n- Bias exists in introductory psychology textbooks, and some urban scientific legends are passed on as true. \n- A study shows that female doctors deliver slightly better care than male doctors in certain situations. \n\nKey questions\n- What are the reasons for earlier school starting ages increasing crime and obesity?\n- How could building in French Polynesian sovereign waters be better than just building a charter city on land with the approval of the government? \n- Why does private healthcare cost less in India than in the US?\n- What factors explain female doctors providing better care in some situations?"
