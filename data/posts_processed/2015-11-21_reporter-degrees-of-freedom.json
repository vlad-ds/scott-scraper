    "summary": "Key ideas\n- News outlets often pick and choose data from studies to support their news stories.\n- A recent study by Rice University, which received coverage from various news outlets, found minimal instances of discrimination against overweight men in retail settings.\n- However, the study's findings were presented with a dramatic and inaccurate conclusion by some outlets, highlighting how news reporting often misinterprets study results.\n\nKey learnings\n- News outlets pick and choose data from studies to support their headlines.\n- Sometimes, the headlines don't necessarily let the reader know the full picture.\n- It is essential to read beyond the headlines and abstracts to understand what a study has found.\n\nKey questions\n- How can we ensure that news reporting accurately represents study results?\n- Can we trust headline reporting to deliver us with the correct information?\n- If we don't read beyond the headlines, are we missing out on essential knowledge?"
