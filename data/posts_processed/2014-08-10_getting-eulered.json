    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Math is systematized rigor and sometimes you need it to find flaws in arguments.\n- Statistics is the field where it's hardest to identify flaws in arguments.\n- The author tries to route around mathematical objections to identify deep methodological truths.\n- The author argues that the Eulering problem cannot be solved using a single mathematical argument.\n- Complicated and diverse ideas should be used to support the argument.\n- Truth is usually revealed through multiple different arguments.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Deep mathematical objections require a good understanding of the underlying maths.\n- Finding methodological truths may be possible by identifying why an equation doesn't prove the desired conclusion.\n- Instead of directly answering mathematical objections, it may be possible to re-route the argument around them.\n- Solving problems like Eulering requires a toolkit of different useful tricks.\n- There is no general solution to worries about Eulering.\n\nKey questions:\n- Am I being informed of deep methodological truths or am I being Eulered?\n- How can I identify deep methodological objections without having an advanced math degree?\n- What are some tips for avoiding getting Eulered by people with higher mathematical abilities?\n- How can complicated and diverse ideas be used to support the argument against Eulering?\n- What are some useful tricks in the toolkit for solving problems like Eulering?\n"
