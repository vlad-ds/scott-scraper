    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Zipfian Academy is like App Academy for data science, offering an alternative to traditional higher education.\n- May 7th is International Tell Your Crush Day, which could help people finally confess their crushes.\n- Male rape is a bigger problem than commonly acknowledged, but estimates of its prevalence vary.\n- Evidence is emerging that some medical residents working longer shifts make fewer mistakes than those working shorter shifts. \n\nKey learnings\n- Zipfian Academy offers an affordable alternative to traditional higher education.\n- International Tell Your Crush Day could be a helpful way to make romantic confessions.\n- The prevalence of male rape is disputed, and more data is needed.\n- Longer resident shifts may result in fewer medical errors than shorter shifts.\n\nKey questions\n- Could more affordable alternatives to traditional higher education become widespread in the future?\n- Will International Tell Your Crush Day become a more widely recognized holiday?\n- How prevalent is male rape compared to other forms of sexual assault?\n- Will the medical establishment adjust policies to allow for longer resident shifts?"
