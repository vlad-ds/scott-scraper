    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- We underestimate our intellectual progress because every sliver of knowledge acquired gets backpropagated unboundedly into the past.\n- In the past, people talked about finding \"the gene for intelligence\" on just a couple of chromosomes, but this was an oversimplified view.\n- Modern genetics has advanced by accepting the complexity of the genome and testing for many factors instead of just one or two.\n- Other fields of study, such as psychiatry, may benefit from a move toward looking for more numerous causes rather than just one cause.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Genetics is complex, but it is simple in that there are a finite number of possible causes.\n- Polycausal models that incorporate many factors may be a more productive way to study complex phenomena like depression.\n- Rather than trying to find \"the\" cause or \"the\" ten causes, researchers should focus on figuring out how to deal with numerous causes.\n\nKey questions:\n- What can other fields like psychiatry learn from genetics about dealing with polycausality?\n- How can we use polycausal scores to diagnose and treat depression and other complex disorders?\n- How can we best balance simplicity and complexity in our scientific models of the world?"
