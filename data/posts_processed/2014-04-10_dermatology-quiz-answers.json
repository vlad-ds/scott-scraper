    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Americans who drive a lot get more UV light on the left side of their faces, which may contribute to left-sided skin cancer.\n- Sun exposure may protect against cancer.\n- A randomized trial showed that Botox improved depression symptoms in 52% of patients versus 15% of the placebo group.\n- The facial feedback hypothesis suggests that facial musculature plays a role in emotions, and paralyzing frowning muscles makes it harder to feel sad.\n- Botox may improve mood in healthy people without depression.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Interesting medical facts can lead to unexpected findings and ideas.\n- New interventions can have both positive and negative implications, including cost and utilitarian calculus.\n\nKey questions:\n- How does sun exposure protect against cancer?\n- Is the Botox effect susceptible to happiness set points?\n- How does the cost of Botox compare to other interventions in the utilitarian calculus?"
