    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- The AI risk discourse is centered around AIs as strategic creatures that maximize pre-programmed goals.\n- Most of the latest advances in machine learning have been engaging with the neural network, arranged in \"cells\" that peruse the image and conceptualize it into elements, items and themes.\n- The Engineer's and Biologist's approaches towards AGI could be opposing. While the former believes AGI will require a different kind of programming, the Biologist's perspective is that we can learn from the brain's evolution and composition to create AGI.\n- Categorization, abstraction, and difficulty between the perception/motivation/ cognition systems are mixed, as exemplified by the \"edge\" cases of what is defined as a \"bird\".\n \nKey learnings:\n- Recent advancements in machine learning have been heavily engaged in neural networks.\n- AI categories can be made in the same way as humans.\n- The perception/motivation/cognition differentiation is not as deeply separated in the brain's systems as previously believed, and in fact, could tie into agents' desires and their incentives. \n\nKey questions:\n- Do recent advancements in neural networks change the paradigm of the Bostromian approach to understanding AI?\n- How far are advancements towards creating an AGI or human-level intelligence? \n- How different will a tangible AGI program be if it has been created based on the same principles and codes as a neural net?\n- How might humans learn morality the same way as illustrated by the example of adopting parenting or religious practices?"
