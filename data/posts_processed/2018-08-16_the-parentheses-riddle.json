    "summary": "Key ideas\n- A trick question asks respondents to choose which of two sequences are best paired with parentheses \u201c()\u201d\n- Most respondents choose either A (XYXX) or B (YXXY) as the correct answer\n- Age is a significant factor, with people in their 20s twice as likely to choose B compared to those in their 60s\n\nKey learnings\n- Age may affect the ability to process parentheses in sequence\n- IQ and SAT scores do not correlate with the ability to solve the parentheses question\n- Conscientiousness and techiness only have a small effect on the ability to solve the question\n\nKey questions\n- Why are people in their 20s more likely to choose B as the correct answer?\n- Is there a connection between age-related cognitive decline and the ability to solve the parentheses question?\n- Could the medium-sized dementia-screening industry provide insights into this question?"
