    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Reciprocity is a dating site where users can checkmark the names of their Facebook friends whom they want to date. \n- Reciprocity reveals a match when two users checkmark each other's names. \n- Users sometimes don't receive the notification of a match even when there is a mutual checkmark, causing confusion and self-doubt. \n- The act of asking someone out in person is a stronger signal of interest than just checking a box on a dating site. \n\nKey learnings\n- The self-defeating behavior on Reciprocity shows that pain and awkwardness can sometimes be the active ingredients in social systems. \n- Trying to improve social systems without fully understanding them can have unintended consequences. \n\nKey questions\n- Why do some users prefer the pain and awkwardness of asking someone out in person instead of just checking a box on the site? \n- How can dating sites like Reciprocity improve their system to avoid confusion and self-doubt among users? \n- What are other examples of social systems where bureaucracy, pain, or awkwardness are the active ingredients?"
