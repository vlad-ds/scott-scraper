    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Nootropics are substances that are claimed to improve mental functioning.\n- Some substances have been confirmed to have neuroprotective and cognitive benefits through studies.\n- The online nootropics community experiments with various substances, but there is little scientific literature to support their efficacy.\n- The effectiveness of various nootropics was tested through a survey of 162 respondents from online nootropics communities, with caffeine and modafinil being the most effective.\n- Survey results for various nootropics\n- -afinils show promise, but no \"smoking gun\" for any substance being definitely-exciting\n- Potential for tolerance with modafinil\n- Plans for future research and surveys\n\nKey learnings:\n- The nootropic community experiments with a variety of substances without being sure of their efficacy.\n- The efficacy of various nootropics varies, with caffeine and modafinil being the most effective.\n- Placebo effects can influence ratings of the effectiveness of nootropics.\n- Dosages of nootropics do not show consistent relationships with effectiveness.\n- There is a wide range of experiences and results with different nootropics\n- Tolerance may be a concern with modafinil\n- Future surveys should aim to have better standardization and more responses\n\nKey questions:\n- Can more standardized research be conducted to properly assess the effectiveness of nootropics?\n- How can the effects of placebo be minimized in testing the effectiveness of nootropics?\n- How can dosages of nootropics be properly established to maximize their effectiveness?\n- Which nootropics show the most promising results?\n- How should dose-response relationships be analyzed in future surveys?\n- Are there ways to better standardize ratings and responses?\n"
