    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- The focus on Marx\u2019s influence from Hegel is a great feature of Marx: A Very Short Introduction. \n- Hegel was an extremely important philosopher during the 19th century, but now, he has many critics. \n\nKey learnings:\n- Philosophy can rarely unite around a single consensus belief, and it rarely disproves anything thoroughly enough to admit the error.\n- There are alternative ways to read a historical text, such as reading it backwards to identify which ideas are influential today.\n\nKey questions:\n- Is the reason Hegel has fallen out of favor simply because he was a crackpot or there are other reasons?\n- What parts of our thinking today are the result of Hegelian ideas, and how much do we really know about Hegelian philosophy?"
