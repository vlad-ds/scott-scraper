    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- A tool called DW-Nominate is used to analyze congresspersons\u2019 votes to identify their position on the political spectrum.\n- The same tool could be used to analyze moral decisions made by people to identify an objective basis for morality.\n- The author proposes naturalistic experiments instead of multiple-choice questions to identify moral positions.\n- The author ponders the potential usefulness of identifying an objective basis for morality, and how it could be applied in practice.\n- The author suggests that DW-Nominate could be used to evaluate morality in societies with differing cultural norms.\n\nKey learnings:\n- DW-Nominate can identify political positioning based on voting patterns, without requiring input about left vs. right or other groupings.\n- Naturalistic experiments could be useful in analyzing real-life moral decisions.\n- Identifying an objective basis for morality could have practical applications such as selecting judges and officials.\n\nKey questions:\n- Can we use DW-Nominate to identify an objective basis for morality?\n- Would DW-Nominate work in societies with norms vastly different from our own?\n- What are the limitations of naturalistic experiments in identifying moral positions?\n- How could identifying an objective basis for morality be applied in practice?"
