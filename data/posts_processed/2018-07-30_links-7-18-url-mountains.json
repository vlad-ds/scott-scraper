    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- British soldier James Brooke became the king of northern Borneo after being wounded in the Anglo-Burmese War.\n- A study shows that $150 devoted to activist charities saves one pig per year, compared to other effective charities that work with humans.\n- Fish oil supplements only help against depression if they have over 60% EPA.\n- A new meta-analysis confirms that women in science deal with less sexual harassment than women in other fields.\n- The Royal Game of Ur, the oldest board game in the world, was popular throughout the Near East and survived until the 1950s.\n- The percentage of college degrees earned in humanities has dropped from 7.5% to 5% in the past ten years.\n- The decrease in humanities degrees is possibly due to more people choosing degrees that are believed to provide better job opportunities.\n- Marginal Revolution has published posts on topics such as educational attainment and migration patterns.\n- There is a debate around whether or not President Trump should be viewed as a strategist or a clown.\n- Ecuador is reportedly planning to hand over Julian Assange to the UK.\n\nKey learnings:\n- $100 donated to a charity could offset eating pork one meal a day for a year.\n- Effective fish oil supplements should have over 60% EPA.\n- Women in science deal with less sexual harassment than women in other fields.\n- The Royal Game of Ur is the oldest board game in the world.\n- The exodus from humanities programs has occurred continuously, even with an improving economy.\n- Household income explains only 7% of the variance in educational attainment.\n- Historians once believed certain old structures must have been built by gods or giants.\n\nKey questions:\n- What other effective charities work with humans besides activist charities?\n- Why do fish oil supplements need over 60% EPA for them to be effective against depression?\n- What can be done to decrease sexual harassment in other fields besides science?\n- How did The Royal Game of Ur survive for so long despite changing cultural norms and the rise of new games?\n- Why has there been a decrease in humanities degrees?\n- Should President Trump be viewed as a strategist or a clown?\n- What will happen to Julian Assange if Ecuador hands him over to the UK?\n"
