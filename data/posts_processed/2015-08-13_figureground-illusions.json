    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Distress of the privileged: privileged groups who lose some privilege can think the system is biased against them.\n- EA movement: Dylan Matthews is concerned that AI concerns are taking over the EA movement.\n    - Effective altruist survey suggests that overestimation of concern with AI risk.\n    - EA Summit has only one event explicitly about AI, and two others more generically x-risk related.\n    - The Bay Area AI event got special billing, but not because AI is the only important thing.\n    - Global poverty is a primary concern for EA.\n- Figure-ground illusion: people can perceive an issue as dominant in a situation where they are given an equal place. \n\nKey learnings:\n- Unpopular ideologies could also experience distress of the privileged.\n- Figure-ground illusion can mislead perceptions of dominance.\n\nKey questions:\n- What is Dylan Matthews' concern with AI concerns in the EA movement?\n- Does the effective altruist survey demonstrate overestimation of concern with AI risk?\n- What events took place at the EA Summit and why?\n- What is the primary concern for EA?\n- Why might people perceive issues as dominant when given an equal place?"
