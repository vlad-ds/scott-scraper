    "summary": "Key ideas\n- During the 1500s, Caribbean was home to Jewish pirates using swashbuckling names like \"The Pirate Rabbi\" and naming their ships \"Queen Esther\".\n- Miami lawyer's pants burst into flames during court proceedings.\n- Tesco in the UK has confirmed to donate all unsold food to charity.\n- Illegal immigration from Mexico is down by almost half since last year.\n- Regarding sex/gender in biology, Jerry Coyne and other authors give negative reviews of Cordelia Fine's new book, while PZ Myers praises it.\n- Federal research bodies in the US plan to deregulate social science research.\n- There have been claims of skewed evidence on multigenerational mobility.\n\nKey learnings\n- There is a generalized perspective of 'if it's up and coming, it's bound to succeed'.\n- Positive change can come from contentless rallying flags if they attract the right individuals.\n- The exchange rate between the Somali shilling and US dollar is unstable.\n\nKey questions\n- Could Jewish pirates point to new questions about identity and piracy in the early modern world?\n- How will the deregulation of social research impact the possibilities for studies and research?\n- What are the best ways to ensure evidence in studies and research is accurate and trustworthy?"
