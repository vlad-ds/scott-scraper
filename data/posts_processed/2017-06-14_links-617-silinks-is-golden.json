    "summary": "Key ideas\n- A variety of interesting and sometimes unusual news stories, such as how J.R.R. Tolkien's great granddaughter is the UK's only blind, competitive fencer and the interesting history behind the Allahakbarries cricket team. \n- Some reviews of scientific studies or reports, such as the claim that low-resting heart rate is the best biological correlate of antisocial and criminal behaviour, and the suggestion that having more brain cells could increase risk of brain tumors.\n- Some political comment, such as a report on a lawsuit against ABC for $5.7bn and the debate over Democratic prospects in light of the Republican win in a recent election. \n\nKey learnings\n- An interesting way to present data, through the Girih tile designs of Islamic art.\n- A potential issue for pregnant women - appearing in a medical blog - is that using hot tubs can increase risks of certain birth defects.\n- An interesting and informative overview of the selection theory behind Ashkenazi genetic diseases.\n- The importance of prediction markets, whose probabilities on aggregate have apparently remained impressive accurate recently.\n\nKey questions\n- Is it ethical to ignore the research that shows that lower-income children need more individualized attention and time from mentors in order to succeed? \n- Could Donald Trump be suffering from mild age-related cognitive impairment? \n- Are we more likely to elect a 70+ year-old president who could be suffering age-related cognitive impairment? \n- What can we learn from the variability of state regulations around the shooting of Bigfoot?"
