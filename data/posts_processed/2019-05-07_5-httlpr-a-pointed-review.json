    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- In 1996, research discovered that individuals with an unusual version of the serotonin transporter gene 5-HTTLPR are often depressed.\n- 5-HTTLPR appears to affect the amygdala and reactivity of the HPA axis, leading researchers to believe it may have relevance for antidepressant treatment.\n- Over 450 studies have been conducted on 5-HTTLPR and its contribution to depression and other psychiatric conditions (e.g. PTSD, insomnia, nostalgia-proneness), but many studies did not have sample sizes large enough to detect an effect.\n- A more recent study with over 600,000+ participants found that 5-HTTLPR and seventeen other comparable \u201cdepression genes\u201d had no effect on depression, casting doubt upon previous studies.\n- GeneSight is a company that claims to predict which anti-depressant will work best for a given patient by checking their genes.\n- The genes used in GeneSight's test have been proven to have no or little effect on depression.\n- The author is worried that no one is noticing the failure of GeneSight's method, and that there may be other scientific hypotheses that are similarly unproven.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Little research has been conducted on the relationship between genes and psychiatric conditions using standardized techniques necessary to detect an effect.\n- Even small effects require samples sizes of at least 34,000 people, yet most studies on 5-HTTLPR did not have sample sizes large enough to detect an effect.\n- The accumulation of studies investigating the relationship between a single gene and a complex trait like depression should have lead to greater knowledge but ended up providing less.\n- GeneSight's method for predicting antidepressant response based on genetics is flawed.\n- Claims made by companies like GeneSight should be treated skeptically.\n- Independent research is needed to validate claims made by private companies.\n\nKey questions:\n- How have psychiatrists justified the use of 5-HTTLPR and other depression genes in the face of inconclusive or negative results?\n- Why have antidepressant pharmacogenomic tests, which rely on genes like 5-HTTLPR, become so popular despite evidence that they do not work?\n- What are the implications for the field of psychiatry given the accumulation of fake results based on single gene studies?\n- How many other scientific hypotheses and products are similarly unproven?\n- Why are there no updates on GeneSight's failed method?\n- How can we ensure that claims made by private companies are independently researched and validated?\n"
