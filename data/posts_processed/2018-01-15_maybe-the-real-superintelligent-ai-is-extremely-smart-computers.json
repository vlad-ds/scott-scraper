    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Chiang argues that hypothetical superintelligent AIs sound like modern capitalism, both relentlessly optimizing for their chosen goal while ignoring human values.\n- He uses projection to explain why Silicon Valley capitalists envision the end of the world as a form of unchecked capitalism.\n- The author critiques Chiang's comparison, finding it weak and flawed.\n\nKey learnings\n- Insight is crucial in avoiding the pursuit of goals that are catastrophic to get wrong.\n- Hunting-for-resemblances can generate plausible-sounding arguments, but it is a known bug in the human brain that can be done to anything.\n\nKey questions\n- Why does Chiang use projection to explain Silicon Valley capitalists' envisioning of the world's end?\n- How can we improve risk assessment when dealing with issues that could be catastrophic to get wrong?\n- What other known bugs in the human brain should be avoided when dealing with complex issues such as AI risk?"
