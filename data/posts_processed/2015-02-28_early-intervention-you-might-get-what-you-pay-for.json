    "summary": "Key ideas\n- There is a debate between the genetics and psychiatric communities regarding the impact of childhood experiences and education on life outcomes.\n- A randomized controlled trial by Dodge et al found that an intervention consisting of extra classes and enrichment programs from elementary school to high school had a significant positive effect on various psychiatric disorders, drug/alcohol abuse, risky sexual behavior, and domestic abuse.\n- This intervention cost $60,000 per child and its effects on employment and incarceration were not significant.\n\nKey learnings\n- Intensive interventions can change children's personality and life outcomes 10 years down the road.\n- The cost of such an intervention may be justified if it produces significant improvements in children's lives.\n- The study's endpoints may be questionable, and more research is needed to determine which part of the intervention produced positive effects.\n\nKey questions\n- Can interventions that cost $60,000 per child be scaled to large populations?\n- How can interventions be tailored to produce the most effective outcomes?\n- What is the best way to measure life outcomes, and what factors should studies take into account when evaluating them?"
