    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Assortative mating is the tendency for similar people to marry and have children.\n- Highly analytical tech workers in Silicon Valley marrying each other could put their children at high risk of autism.\n- A survey of highly analytical readers found a higher rate of autism than the general population.\n- There was no significant increase in autism risk when both partners were highly analytical.\n\nKey learnings\n- The survey sample was likely 2-3x more autistic than the US population.\n- Childhood social class may affect autism diagnoses.\n- Autism rates in highly analytical couples did not significantly increase.\n\nKey questions\n- How concerned should we be about the potential risks of assortative mating among highly analytical tech workers?\n- Is being highly analytical necessarily on a continuum with autism?\n- What are the limitations of this survey, and what larger studies should be done to assess the risk of assortative mating on autism?"
