    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- The role of parties in the American system and the call for ideologically distinct and powerful political parties.\n- Partisanship during the Civil War was intense and involved violence and threatened violence in Congress.\n- The peak of US unity was around 1820, partly due to the need to stand together against Indians.\n- In early America, there were more office-seekers than federal offices, overwhelming the supply, causing intense competition which sometimes led to riots.\n- \"Culture-metric\" data support the perception of declining cooperation between business and labor over time.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Different factors affect the level of polarization in a society such as social identity and competition for power and influence.\n- Social cooperation could evolve depending on the perceived threat from a common enemy.\n- Political polarization and conflict are not new but have historically manifested in different ways.\n- Economic hardship can help to delegitimize the prevailing ideological regime and give rise to different ideas.\n\nKey questions:\n- What other factors contribute to the growing intraelite conflict in early America?\n- How can society balance the need for unity and cooperation against individualism and self-interest?\n- How can individuals and groups work towards bridging social capital to build a more cohesive society?"
