    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- The low level of money in politics is surprising because spending on politics is less than on many other industries.\n- Ordinary people, the rich, and corporations should donate more to politics based on their interests but they do not.\n- Ansolabehere argues that money does not have a significant effect on victory or influence with a candidate who wins, but this hypothesis may not account for the influence of lobbying or media.\n\nKey learnings:\n- The politics industry makes relatively little money, even when adding up all donations to candidates, lobbying, think tanks, and advocacy organizations.\n- Coordinating spending on politics can be difficult and is likely one reason why people do not donate more, even if they care deeply about an issue.\n- Pledging to donate to charity can help overcome these issues and lead to more spending on important issues.\n\nKey questions:\n- Why do people spend so little on politics?\n- What are the factors that keep money out of politics and how can they be overcome?\n- How can coordination problems be addressed to encourage more spending on important issues?"
