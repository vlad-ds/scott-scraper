    "summary": "Key ideas\n- The photo of Alois Alzheimer and his colleagues in Munich shows the discovery of several neurological diseases.\n- Alzheimer's lab was on the bleeding edge of advances in neurology and psychiatry due to good histological staining, being in the right place at the right time, and Kraepelin's organizational and funding skills.\n- The natural tendency for an institution to gain a reputation for being the best and then attract the best people also played a role in the success.\n\nKey learnings\n- The last few decades haven't been great for neuropsychiatry.\n- It's easier to pick low-hanging fruit in one paradigm than to get entirely new ones. \n- Eventually, all the stuff that was easy to discover this way got discovered, and there just aren't any equally fruitful paradigms coming to our attention.\n\nKey questions\n- Why did the discovery of neurological diseases in the late 19th and early 20th century come out of one lab?\n- Do paradigms in science need to shift in order for new discoveries to emerge?\n- Why has neuropsychiatry stagnated in recent decades?"
