    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Predictive processing attributes movement to strong predictions about proprioceptive sensations. \n- The brain minimizes predictive error by fulfilling its own prophecy.\n- PP thus implements the distinctive circular dynamics described by Cisek and Kalaska using a famous quote from the American pragmatist John Dewey.\n\nKey learnings\n- Active inference, the agent moves body and sensors in ways that amount to actively seeking out the sensory consequences that their brains expect.\n- Cognitive \u201clayers\u201d, which act at various levels (light-intensity-detection vs. edge-detection vs. object-detection, or movements vs. positions-in-space vs. specific-muscle-actions vs. specific-muscle-fiber-tensions). \n- PCT is a good model, but what\u2019s good about it is that it approximates PP.\n\nKey questions\n- What are the parallels between lower level systems like motor control and high-level systems like communism or social desirability?\n- Can we look through their other work and see if they\u2019ve got even more smart ideas that might be ahead of their time?"
