    "summary": "Key ideas\n- The author analyzes data on dominance, submission, sadism, and masochism to understand the sexual preferences of men.\n- BDSM preferences were found to be gendered, with most cis men preferring the dominant role.\n- Factors that made men more likely to be dominant included good social skills, high risk-taking, high ambition, conservative political values, low anxiety, high status, and belief that others are trustworthy.\n- Submissive men reported lower sex drive, fewer dates, fewer sexual partners, and fewer long-term relationships than dominant men.\n\nKey learnings\n- Most men in the sample preferred the dominant role, with notable gender and orientation differences.\n- The sexual roles were not associated with more prosaic forms of selfishness or self-sacrifice.\n- Factors that made men more likely to be dominant included personality traits such as low anxiety, high status, and good social skills.\n\nKey questions\n- Why are BDSM preferences heavily gendered? \n- Are men who grew up poor more likely to exhibit sexual sadism in adulthood?\n- How do personality traits such as good social skills and low anxiety contribute to the likelihood of men being sexually dominant?"
