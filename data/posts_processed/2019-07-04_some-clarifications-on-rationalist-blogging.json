    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Only a small percentage of SSC commenters identify as rationalists.\n- Not every blog by a rationalist is a \"rationalist blog\".\n- SSC engages with effective altruism, but it's not its main focus.\n- Claims that rationality has practical utility are questioned in this blog.\n- Readers who want more from rationality can find it in other places like the Center for Applied Rationality, Less Wrong, and the EA Forum.\n\nKey learnings:\n- SSC is not a rationalist monastery or a prominent member of the rationalist community.\n- SSC focuses on interesting problems and does not claim to offer practical advice.\n\nKey questions:\n- How can \"rationality\" be defined?\n- What is the relationship between SSC and the rationalist community?\n- How useful is rationality in everyday life?\n- How can readers find more information on rationality and effective altruism?"
