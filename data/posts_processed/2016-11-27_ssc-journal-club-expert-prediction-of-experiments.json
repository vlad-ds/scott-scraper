    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- The study aims to determine if people with expertise in a field are better than non-experts in predicting the best outcome of incentive schemes in a behavioral economics experiment.\n- Knowledgeable academics have an advantage in predicting outcomes of the experiment, but the edge is not significant and with enough exceptions that it's worth discussing.\n- Experts were better than non-experts in guessing the exact score for each condition, but not any better at guessing which conditions would do better or worse relative to one another.\n- Even a little \"wisdom of crowds\" was enough to overwhelm the expert advantage.\n- Having even a little knowledge of individuals' forecasting ability screened off expert status.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Being clever and having a rationality skill are more crucial than expertise in predicting best outcomes of an experiment.\n- MBA students performed worse than the undergrads despite being highly intelligent and from a top business school, which is a fatal flaw to an IQ-based explanation.\n- The experts thought their prestige and knowledge would benefit them but they were wrong.\n\nKey questions:\n- Are there any theories of psychology or economics that could help people predict how an incentive experiment would go?\n- How reliable are pundits or experts in predicting outcomes that are vaguely related to their field?\n- Can we place the decision-making process entirely in the hands of people from top business schools?"
