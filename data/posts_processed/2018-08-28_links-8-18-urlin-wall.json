    "summary": "Key ideas\n- DMT users are building a psychedelic temple in upstate New York\n- A new AI can draw a picture based on a given caption, but it's not very good\n- Emergency medicine doctors must avoid using ballpoint pens to puncture throats of people with blocked airways\n- India claimed to develop a room-temperature superconductor, but the story is potentially fraudulent \n- Mastodon is a social media platform more advantageous than Twitter as it is a lesser outrage machine\n- XJ Jinping may be facing weaknesses in his rule\n- Courts have been questioning Trump's initiatives\n- China is threatening those who boycott Israel \n- Recently, a number of rare (and probably insignificant) climate changes have been reported\n- There is new antimalarial bed net, which is effective against otherwise-resistant strains of the disease \n- Using population genetic testing shows that some people are at higher risk for heart disease \n- Eli Tyre on Less Wrong has replicated strong birth order effects in samples of famous mathematicians\n\n\nKey learnings\n- Sometimes a change of residency or job is good for people who may have status quo bias \n- Punishing executives for wrongdoing through legal fines may not be entirely effective \n- The field of psychometry could use more cross-replication of birth-order effects data \n\nKey questions\n- How effective are emergency medicine physicians who use ballpoint pens to puncture throats in a life-threatening situation?\n- What is the truth behind the Indian development of a room-temperature superconductor?\n- Are smaller social media structures healthier than their larger counterparts in design?\n- What are the motivations behind China's actions regarding its boycotting of Israel?"
