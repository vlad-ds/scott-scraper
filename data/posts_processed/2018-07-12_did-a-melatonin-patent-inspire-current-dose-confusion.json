    "summary": "Key ideas\n- MIT patented the use of reasonable doses of melatonin up to 1 mg for promoting sleep\n- The FDA did not regulate melatonin as its research showed it to be non-toxic even at extremely high doses\n- Since the patent didn't cover other doses of melatonin, supplement manufacturers produced higher doses of melatonin, such as 3 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, etc.\n\nKey learnings\n- Supplement manufacturers started producing higher doses of melatonin to avoid paying royalties to MIT.\n- Melatonin is labeled as a dietary supplement by the FDA, which does not require FDA regulation, even though it is a hormone.\n\nKey questions\n- Who would patent a drug only up to a certain dose?\n- How much should one discount a compelling-sounding theory based on the bias of its inventor?\n- How concerned should we be if a theory seems to violate efficient market assumptions?"
