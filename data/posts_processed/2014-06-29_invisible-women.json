    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- The entry of women into the workforce produced little effect on US GDP even though the number of women in the workforce increased significantly over a period of 50 years.\n- The author questions why the GDP trend did not deviate upward from 1935 to 1985 when almost 50% more people, predominantly women, entered the workforce.\n- The author explores possible solutions to this question, including false GDP data, low-resolution GDP data, unpaid labor in the home, and all gains being made by women coming from men's pockets.\n\nKey learnings:\n- GDP only counts paid-for goods and services, not unpaid labor or benefits of putting women to work.\n- Despite women increasing the labor supply by 50%, their entrance into the workforce did not change the demand for labor.\n\nKey questions:\n- Why did the entry of women into the workforce produce little effect on US GDP?\n- Did women entering the workforce drive down male wages?"
