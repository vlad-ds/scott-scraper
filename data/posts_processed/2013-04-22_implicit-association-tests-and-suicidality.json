    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Nock & Banaji (2007) attempted to use the Implicit Association Test (IAT) to measure suicidal intent in psychiatric patients\n- IAT could be an alternate means of assessment to current methods of predicting suicidal intent which rely on self-reporting\n- The IAT works by measuring reaction time when participants categorize concepts, and the study used categories such as \"self-harm\" and \"not-self-harm\"\n- The study claims that the IAT was able to distinguish healthy controls, people with past suicidal ideation, and past suicide attempters with high accuracy\n- However, the self-harm aspect of the study is problematic, and the IAT's usefulness for predicting and detecting suicidal tendencies is uncertain.\n\nKey learnings\n- The IAT is a computer-based instrument that measures reaction time when participants categorize concepts\n- The IAT has potential as an alternate means of assessing suicidal intent, but its usefulness and applicability for predicting suicidal tendencies is uncertain.\n\nKey questions\n- Is the IAT more reliable than current methods of predicting suicidal intent that rely on self-reporting?\n- How can the IAT be improved to make it more effective at predicting and detecting suicidal tendencies?\n- Is the self-harm aspect of the IAT a valid way of measuring suicidal tendencies, or does it present ethical concerns?"
