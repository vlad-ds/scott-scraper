    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- PANDA (Prescribing ANtiDepressants Appropriately) is the largest non-pharma antidepressant trial ever conducted and is designed to mimic \u201cthe real world\u201d.\n- Measuring real-world efficacy is especially important for antidepressant research because past studies have failed to match up with common sense.\n- The study used patient-reported \u201cuncertainty\u2026about the possible benefit of an antidepressant\u201d to select participants.\n- The study showed only small to low-medium effect sizes for everything.\n- The study\u2019s finding of a 0.4 \u2013 0.5 effect size on patient response closely matches another study\u2019s finding of an 0.4 \u2013 0.5 effect size on depressed mood.\n\nKey learnings:\n- It is really hard to measure antidepressant outcomes and all endpoints conflict with each other.\n- Antidepressants do better on patient report than on depression tests.\n- Patients care a lot less about smaller symptoms and more about feeling happy again.\n- Targeted treatment with more typical vs. atypical depression could bring the effect size up.\n\nKey questions:\n- Can we really trust clinical trials that fail to match up with common sense?\n- How can we measure antidepressant outcomes more accurately?\n- Are our depression tests effective? How can we improve them?\n- How can we prescribe antidepressants more confidently?"
