    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- The author wanted to create a concept-map of the rationalist community.\n- The map includes external communities that have communication with the rationalist community.\n- The city size on the map is proportional to site Alexa rank, number of followers, or a wild guess if unavailable.\n- The author apologizes if he missed a community, and many of his choices were random.\n\nKey learnings:\n- The map shows the various communities that are part of the rationalist community and their links.\n- The city size on the map reflects the popularity of the community.\n- The author's choices were based on who he knew about, and not including a community was not intentional.\n\nKey questions:\n- What are the other communities that have significant communication/cross-pollination with the rationalist community?\n- How accurate are the estimates for city size on the map?\n- How can the map be improved in the future?"
