    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- The availability of accurate predictions by oracles could prevent wars between countries.\n- However, the use of oracular predictions for settling wars could lead to an increase in wars due to countries being more willing to invade.\n- Prediction markets, coupled with futarchy, can be a potential solution to avoid wars between rational countries.\n- Wars between superintelligences could be resolved through negotiations based on compromise of values and prediction of outcomes.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Accurate oracular predictions can have significant implications on countries' decisions to engage in wars.\n- Using oracles to settle wars can lead to an increase in the number of wars.\n- Prediction markets and futarchies can potentially help prevent wars between rational countries.\n\nKey questions:\n- What factors lead countries to decide to engage in a war despite accurate predictions?\n- Can futarchy be applied practically on a large scale to avoid wars between countries?\n- How can countries ensure that prediction markets remain unbiased and accurate?"
