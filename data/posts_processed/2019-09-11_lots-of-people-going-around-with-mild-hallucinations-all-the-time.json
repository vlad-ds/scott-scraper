    "summary": "Key ideas:\n\n- Hallucinogen persisting perceptual disorder (HPPD) is a condition where people who take psychedelics continue hallucinating indefinitely.\n- Prevalence estimates of HPPD vary greatly, and many people who take psychedelics will have very minor permanent changes to their vision.\n- K&J\u2019s study based in the National Survey of Drug Use and Health is criticized for violating one of the cardinal sins of psychiatric questioning and not asking questions about psychosis-like symptoms properly.\n- Some people have HPPD-like visual hallucinations even without taking psychedelic drugs.\n- Psychedelics may make people more likely to believe in woo and have certain classes of visual hallucinations.\n\nKey learnings:\n\n- Visual disturbances that persist after psychedelic use are relatively common, but they are generally mild.\n- Many people who have these persistent visual disturbances do not seek medical treatment, and some do not view them as problematic.\n- The prevalence of HPPD is difficult to estimate because it is unclear what people mean when they report seeing things that others cannot.\n\nKey questions:\n\n- What explains the discrepancy in prevalence estimates of HPPD?\n- How might people\u2019s natural priors affect their susceptibility to HPPD and other forms of hallucination?\n- What are the implications of these findings for our understanding of perception and mental health?"
