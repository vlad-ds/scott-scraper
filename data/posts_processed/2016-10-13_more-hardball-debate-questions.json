    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Jill Stein advocates for eating organic food and blames increasing pesticide exposure for developmental disorders in American children.\n- Hillary Clinton emphasizes the relevance of implicit bias as a problem for police officers and police shootings.\n- Donald Trump's campaign CEO, Steve Bannon, was the acting director of Biosphere 2, and the experiment did not succeed.\n\nKey learnings\n- Jill Stein promotes organic food, but mainstream scientists and media outlets criticize it, claiming that organic food is no healthier than conventionally grown food.\n- While Clinton and her running mate promote the focus on implicit bias as relevant to policing, more rigorous studies show that the implicit association test (IAT) that tests implicit bias is not a good predictor of racism.\n- Stein correlates the increasing exposure to pesticides with developmental disorders in children.\n\nKey questions\n- Do Vox's claims about organic food and pesticides make them complicit in childhood neurodevelopmental disorders?\n- Would Clinton take an Implicit Association Test to measure how easily she associates her name with the adjective \"crooked?\"\n- Should the public be scared of Steve Bannon's involvement in destroying Biosphere 2?"
