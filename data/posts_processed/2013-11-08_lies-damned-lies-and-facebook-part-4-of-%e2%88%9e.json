    "summary": "Key ideas:\n-Claims that anti-rape public awareness campaigns targeting men have been found to be effective are often based on a single study in Vancouver.\n-The evidence that anti-rape campaigns targeting men work is weak.\n-Second derivatives, or changes in the change, of sex crimes in Vancouver between 2010-2011 were volatile, suggesting that the decrease in sexual offenses in 2011 was not necessarily due to the anti-rape campaign.\n\nKey learnings:\n-Second derivatives, or changes in the change, can be used to measure the effects of anti-rape campaigns targeting men.\n-The evidence that anti-rape campaigns targeting men work is weak and requires further study.\n\nKey questions:\n-Can anti-rape public awareness campaigns targeting men be effective?\n-What kind of evidence is needed to show that anti-rape campaigns targeting men work?\n-What other factors can impact crime rates besides anti-rape campaigns?"
