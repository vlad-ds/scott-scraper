    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- \"Bravery debates\" occur when people argue over who is being brave for holding a nonconformist position and who is cowardly for defending the status quo.\n- The persistence of bravery debates is weird because these debates quickly make conversations horrible and infuriating.\n- People tend to believe the deck is stacked against them, even when exposed to genuinely neutral information.\n- Bravery debates are common and persistent because it is easy to get oneself perceived as the brave long-suffering underdog, which can lead to support and romantic desire.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Bravery debates are toxic and make conversations horrible and infuriating.\n- Neutral information does not exist because people tend to believe the deck is stacked against them.\n- Bravery debates persist because they work; people tend to support the brave long-suffering underdog who is perceived as the underdog.\n\nKey questions:\n- Should people get credit for being brave for holding a dangerous and unpopular position?\n- Can opposing groups both be certain they are under siege? \n- How can we avoid falling into the trap of bravery debates?"
