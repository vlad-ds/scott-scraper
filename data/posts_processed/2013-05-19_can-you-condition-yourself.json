    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Some people believe in applying behaviorism to one's self to reinforce positive behaviors, but the author is skeptical.\n- There are three possibilities to explain why this might work, but none seem to hold up.\n- A better alternative might be to use a \"victory gesture\" to reinforce positive behaviors instead.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Behavioral conditioning may not be as simple as giving oneself a reward for positive behavior.\n- Rewards may not be effective motivators if there is no intrinsic desire for them.\n- Reinforcing oneself with a \"victory gesture\" may be a more effective way to promote positive behavior.\n\nKey questions:\n- Is there evidence that self-reinforcement techniques like \"self-consequation\" actually work?\n- How might the brain's reinforcement mechanism affect the effectiveness of self-reinforcement techniques?\n- Can the brain distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic rewards when it comes to reinforcement?"
