    "summary": "Key ideas\n\n- Bee populations are recovering faster than they are declining, according to a report by The Washington Post.\n- An article on Slate explores over twenty scientific studies on topics ranging from genetics to anti-minimum wage studies.\n- A study found test scores are affected by fasting during fetal development, leading to poor brain development and lower test scores as an adult.  Implications are for pregnant mothers to take God's offer to not fast seriously.\n- Two studies analyze bullying and sexism in schools, finding that gender and status play a high factor in both cases.\n- A study examines hormone levels and how they affect gender differences, showing intelligence is negatively correlated with present-day-testosterone but positively correlated to fetal testosterone.\n\nKey learnings\n\n- Scientists rely on facts and ground truths to help frame their research and subsequent findings.\n- Intrauterine factors can permanently harm the brain when developmentally affected by potentially harmful practices.\n- Rationality does not appear to have a general factor that shows a high cognitive ability on avoiding one kind of cognitive bias.\n- Stories throughout the article show how genetics play a factor in many events and outcomes in both daily lives and longstanding history.\n\nKey questions\n\n- What are the limits on the development of abilities that arise through genetics?\n- How can the international community come together to ensure sustainability not only in energy production but in other areas such as food production?\n- Can the general factor of fitness improve the health of individuals with an increased resistance to diseases and illnesses?\n- With the rise of alternative energy sources, how will it affect fossil fuel production and how can communities be aided to manage their shift from fossil fuels?\n\n"
