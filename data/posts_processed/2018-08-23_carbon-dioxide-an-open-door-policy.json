    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Indoor carbon dioxide levels can have a significant effect on cognitive ability and sleep quality.\n- CO2 levels are typically much worse at night when the windows and doors are closed.\n- Human exhalation is the main source of CO2, and buildings with many people in close proximity are the most concerning.\n- Plants that participate in \"dark fixation\" can help to reduce CO2 levels in a room.\n\nKey learnings\n- Increasing CO2 concentration from the level of a well-ventilated building to the level of a poorly-ventilated building had profound effects on cognitive ability.\n- Workers in the best-ventilated offices scored about 25% better on cognitive tests than in the worst-ventilated ones.\n- High physiological levels of carbon dioxide can cause sleep disturbances, and reducing CO2 levels can lead to improved sleep quality and cognitive performance.\n\nKey questions\n- How can we ensure that buildings are properly ventilated to maintain healthy levels of CO2?\n- What are the long-term effects of exposure to high levels of carbon dioxide?\n- How can we better understand the individual variability in sensitivity to CO2 levels?"
