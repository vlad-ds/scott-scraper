    "summary": "Key Ideas:\n- Evidence shows long-term decline in crime rates from the Middle Ages to Industrial Revolution and from 1985 to present; a gap exists from 1850 to 1980.\n- Earlier assertion that crime was stable between 1850 and 1980 may not be accurate after examining a 2002 study on murder rates.\n- Lead levels are strongly suspected of causing crime and have increased with the Industrial Revolution; levels are still higher than pre-industrial societies and correlate with crime rates.\n- Omega-6 fatty acids, commonly found in vegetable oils, are important for brain function; increased consumption of omega-6 compared to omega-3 could derange cognitive functions and affect mental health and behavior.\n- Studies have found a link between omega-6 consumption and homicide rates.\n- Lithium, a neuroprotective agent, has been found to have strong links with crime and suicide rates; modern water treatment/purification may result in less lithium consumption.\n\nKey Learnings:\n- Biological insults such as increased lead and omega-6 consumption and decreased lithium consumption may be at least as worthy of examination as political changes in relation to crime and impulsive behaviors.\n- Nutrition and substance intake can have significant impacts on cognitive functions and mental health.\n\nKey Questions:\n- Was the increase in murder rates from 1850 to 1980 due to the higher levels of lead during this time?\n- How much impact could the increased consumption of omega-6 and decreased consumption of omega-3 through industrial food processing have on cognitive functions and mental health?\n- Could the modern water treatment/purification result in less lithium consumption and contribute to an increase in undesirable/impulsive behaviors?"
