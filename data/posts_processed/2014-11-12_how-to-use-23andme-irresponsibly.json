    "summary": "Key ideas\n- 23andMe was banned by the FDA from claiming to be able to predict personal outcomes from genes\n- 23andMe users can browse their raw data to find gene or SNP that they are interested in\n- SNPedia is a wiki collection of different SNPs that can provide users with relevant SNPs\n- Genetics studies have limited scope and often fail to replicate themselves\n- The author lists some genes, such as the warrior gene, the cuddle hormone gene, and the divorce gene that they think are fun to look up\n\nKey learnings\n- 23andMe allows users to browse their raw data to find SNPs in their genes\n- The interpretation of the results requires additional research and should not be taken at face value\n\nKey questions\n- Which genes relate to violent tendencies?\n- What is the oxytocin receptor and how does it affect social behavior?\n- What is the orchid gene and how does it affect childhood development?"
