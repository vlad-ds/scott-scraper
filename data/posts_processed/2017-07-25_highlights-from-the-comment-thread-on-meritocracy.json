    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Some commenters question exactly what is meant by meritocracy.\n- Some people define meritocracy as focusing on certain kinds of proxies for merit rather than real merit.\n- There are fundamental concerns that apply even to ideal meritocracies, such as the fear that an upper-class of talented individuals will become a hegemonic group disconnected from the people they're supposed to rule.\n- Meritocracy can lead to cronyism and lack of diversity in leadership positions.\n- The solution to address the problem of meritocracy is not clear.\n- Demanding downstream solutions to upstream problems may not be effective.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Many people believe that rule based on merit can be dangerous and seductive.\n- Some critics argue that the problem isn't inequality of opportunity, it's the power given to those in elite positions.\n- The problem with meritocracy is not the concept itself but rather the potential consequences of its implementation.\n- The solution to address the issue of meritocracy requires a deeper understanding of the factors shaping the distribution of opportunities.\n\nKey questions:\n- What is the \"meritocratic\" outcome when considering Alice and Carol for promotion to management?\n- Can meritocracy in government keep lower-class representatives in touch with their roots?\n- Is the solution to abandon the idea of ruling altogether or to find better ways of identifying talented individuals?\n- How do we address the problem of cronyism without compromising the value of meritocracy?\n- What is the endgame of rejecting meritocracy?\n- What are the factors that shape the composition of applicant pools for leadership positions?\n"
