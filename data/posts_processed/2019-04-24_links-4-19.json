    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Many places outside of the US have branded themselves as the next Silicon Valley.\n- Scientists found that a similar decrease in sperm count and fertility that's affecting humans is also affecting dogs.\n- A published article argues that the rate of antidepressant tapering should be slower and hyperbolic rather than linear.\n- A survey shows that only 8 out of 22 people continue to donate 10% of their income after 5 years.\n- A study suggests that legalized prostitution increases human trafficking and the effect is cultural.\n- A book theorizes that continuing Mexican immigration prevented Mexicans from fully assimilating.\n- Private companies in India perform surgical procedures for 2%-3% of what American hospitals charge.\n- The average rent in NYC has increased from 15% of average income in 1950 to 65% today.\n\nKey learnings\n- Different theories of consciousness are being tested via experiment.\n- Slow and hyperbolic antidepressant tapering is advised.\n- Prostitution legalization seems to have unintended consequences.\n- Continuing Mexican immigration may have prevented Mexicans from fully assimilating.\n- Private companies in India have cheaper surgical procedures.\n- Rent in NYC is significantly increasing.\n\nKey questions\n- How should we mitigate the unintended consequences of prostitution legalization?\n- Will the Mexicans assimilate differently with a slowed Mexican immigration?\n- What implications does the increase in rent in NYC have to the city's economy?\n- Can more objective research be done on the topic of human trafficking?"
