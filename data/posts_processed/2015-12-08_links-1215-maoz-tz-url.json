    "summary": "Key ideas \n- Mapping modern concepts of \u201cright\u201d and \u201cleft\u201d onto the 1700s\u2019 Federalist and Democratic-Republican parties shows there\u2019s not a clear line between them.\n- Blowback theory \u2013 the belief that the West\u2019s harsh response to terrorism is encouraging more terrorism \u2013 does not have strong research support.\n- The \u201c21 Bitcoin Computer\u201d is expensive and impractical, but supporters argue it\u2019s the future.\n- Israeli Jews have a high fertility rate, even among secular Jews, and it\u2019s not fully understood why.\n- Jacobin Magazine\u2019s \u201cReal Utopias\u201d argues that creating non-capitalist institutions to replace capitalism is better than advocating for revolution.\n\nKey learnings \n- There is no clear line between modern \u201cright\u201d and \u201cleft\u201d and the 1700s\u2019 Federalist and Democratic-Republican parties.\n- Blowback theory is not well-supported by research.\n- The \u201c21 Bitcoin Computer\u201d may not be practical, but some think it is the future.\n- Israeli Jews have a high fertility rate compared to other developed countries.\n- Replacing capitalism may be more effective than advocating for revolution.\n\nKey questions \n- Can we identify the Federalist and Democratic-Republican parties as the \u201cgood guys\u201d with the perspective of history?\n- Why do Israeli Jews have such a high fertility rate compared to secular Jewish Americans?\n- Is it better to create non-capitalist institutions to replace capitalism than to advocate for revolution?"
