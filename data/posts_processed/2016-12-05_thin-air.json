    "summary": "Key ideas\n- A study found a correspondence between US topography and US obesity rates; people living at sea level are five times more likely to be obese than those living at 500m elevation, regardless of controlling factors.\n- Altitude anorexia, an acute effect experienced when lowland people go to high altitudes causing weight loss, possibly due to hypoxia, is being studied for potential long-term weight loss solutions.\n- The active ingredient of altitude seems to be hypoxia, where reduced oxygen seems to make people eat less.\n- There are theories CO2 and global warming caused the obesity epidemic, but conflicting studies.\n- Xenoestrogens and gut microbiota are blamed for obesity.\n\nKey learnings\n- People living at sea level are more likely to be obese than those living at 500m elevation not because of poverty, population density or even physical exercise.\n- Altitude anorexia may play a role in understanding how high altitude may affect weight loss.\n- Hypoxia from reduced oxygen contributes to affecting eating habits in people.\n- CO2 and global warming theories have been proposed for causing the obesity epidemic, but there is not enough data to support the argument.\n- Obesity could be caused by chemical and biological factors, such as xenoestrogens and gut microbiota.\n\nKey questions\n- Why does the body lose weight after experiencing altitude anorexia?\n- What other factors could contribute to obesity other than those studied?\n- What effect does low-oxygen environments have on weight gain or loss in people?\n- Is there conclusive evidence that CO2 and global warming have contributed to the obesity epidemic?\n- What are the other low-contrarian theories on the cause of obesity?"
