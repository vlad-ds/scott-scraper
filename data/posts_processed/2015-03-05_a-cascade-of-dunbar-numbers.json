    "summary": "Key ideas\n- The author discusses their experience with micronations and their difficulty in expanding their population despite attempts to do so.\n- They contrast this experience with the Bay Area rationalist community, which is also experiencing difficulty in growing despite being geographically larger.\n- The author introduces the idea of Dunbar's number, which posits that humans have a hard-coded optimal group size of around 150 people.\n- The author discusses how their experience with small groups may be indicative of social group limitations.\n\nKey learnings\n- It is difficult to grow a community beyond a certain size, even with marketing or recruitment campaigns.\n- The size limitation for cohesive social groups may be indicative of a hard-coded limit in humans, as proposed by Dunbar's number.\n- The environment, culture, and enforcement of the group can all affect the size limitations of cohesive social groups.\n\nKey questions\n- What other factors besides group size could impact the growth and success of a community?\n- Is there a way to overcome the social saturation point that limits the growth of some communities?\n- What implications does Dunbar's number have for the growth and structure of social groups, and how can it be studied in different contexts?"
