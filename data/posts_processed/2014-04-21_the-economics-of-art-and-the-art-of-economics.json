    "summary": "Key ideas\n- There is debate and concern over the possibility of Detroit selling masterpieces from its art museum to solve its temporary financial problem.\n- Keeping priceless paintings on display would cost more than $6,000 an hour.\n- The cost of keeping \"The Wedding Dance\" by Pieter Bruegel the Elder on display would be more than $1200 per hour per visitor.\n- The author suggests sell every piece of art in Detroit and hire skilled forgers to make exact copies of them for a couple of hundred dollars each.\n\nKey learnings\n- Trying to think quantitatively can make the right answer obvious.\n- Consequentialism is hard but can help avoid making costly mistakes.\n- Skilled forgers can make exact copies of priceless art pieces for a fraction of the cost.\n\nKey questions\n- Is solving a temporary financial problem worth sacrificing cultural heritage?\n- Does the average visitor to an art museum derive enough value from seeing a particular painting to justify its high cost?\n- How can consequentialism help make better decisions even when we can never do it exactly right?"
