    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- A strange search term that keeps showing up, \u201cbased on your findings, which theory about alien thickness seems most valid or most accurate?\u201d leads to a homework question found on a 7th-grade science class.\n- Question 25 on this assignment, which asks about \u201calien thickness,\u201d seems to have a lack of reference to topics that had come before, so it\u2019s reasonable to assume why all students would Google it.\n- By using a web gizmo, author Scott is able to discover that alien thickness seems to be affected by temperature, which leads to a method of process of elimination to arrive at the right answer.\n- Learning to eliminate wrong answers through test-taking skills can be valuable.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Alien thickness is likely affected by temperature.\n- Test-taking skills such as process of elimination can often help find the right answer.\n\nKey questions:\n- What is causing the \u201calien thickness\u201d search term to be so popular?\n- Do the homework questions, which seem to come out of nowhere in relation to what\u2019s been learned before, actually help students learn anything?\n- What other skills are there to help people answer questions when there\u2019s not enough information provided in the question itself?"
