    "summary": "Key ideas:\n\n- Objections to polyamory stem from two narratives: one concerning women's suffering and another arguing that a few high-status men will monopolize all the sexual relationships.\n- Both these objections share one core concern: men will date multiple women, high-status men will date most of them, leaving women and low-status men to miss out on relationships.\n- However, data from the 2014 LW survey does not support the above theories. The survey reveals that more poly women have multiple partners than poly men, but only a small proportion of poly men have five or more partners.\n- Additionally, poly men are still less likely to be single than mono men, which could imply that polyamory does not hurt the chances of low-status men getting a date.\n\nKey learnings:\n\n- Polyamory does not necessarily disadvantage women or low-status men.\n- Being poly does not significantly increase the number of partners compared to monogamy.\n- There is a possibility of bias in the data set as there were more poly men than poly women and more men overall.\n\nKey questions:\n\n- How do people decide to identify as poly or monogamous?\n- If both single people default to monogamy, does this skew the results?\n- What more evidence do the supporters of NRO and Heartiste's theory need to believe that polyamory is not the institutionalized form of the hookup culture that disadvantages women and low-status men?"
