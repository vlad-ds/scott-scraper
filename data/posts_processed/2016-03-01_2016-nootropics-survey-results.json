    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Nootropics are substances that improve mental function.\n- They promise various benefits including clearer thinking, better concentration, and improved mood.\n- Some nootropics are tested formally in small trials, while many are based only on anecdote and word of mouth.\n- This year's survey of 850 people found that Adderall, LSD microdosing, Phenibut, and modafinil were effective, but are either addictive, illegal without prescription, or both.\n- Tianeptine, Semax, and ashwagandha are the second tier of winners.\n- Alpha Brain underperformed, and picamilon did badly.\n- Bit under 15% of users got addicted to Adderall, while only 3% of users got addicted to phenibut.\n- Among the various varieties of nicotine, cigarettes are the most addictive.\n\nKey learnings:\n- The field of nootropics is not well-studied and many of these substances are based on anecdotal evidence.\n- The efficacy of the nootropic depends largely on the substance and the individual.\n- Addictiveness is a concern with certain nootropics, such as Adderall and nicotine.\n\nKey questions:\n- Is there a way to increase formal testing of nootropics?\n- How can addiction to certain nootropics be avoided?\n- Are there safe ways to consume nicotine as a nootropic?"
