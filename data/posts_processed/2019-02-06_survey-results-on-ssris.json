    "summary": "Key Ideas:\n- SSRIs are widely used for various psychiatric conditions and have been extensively studied, but much is still unknown.\n- A survey of 2,090 people on SSRIs finds that most believe the drugs work and that some SSRIs work better than others.\n- The survey suggests that SSRIs may work better for anxiety than depression and that sexual difficulties, emotional blunting, and fatigue are the most common side effects.\n- The survey also finds that discontinuing SSRIs can be difficult, especially when done abruptly, but most people are eventually successful.\n\nKey Learnings:\n- The most helpful antidepressants are likely to be Lexapro and Prozac, with a slight edge for Lexapro in effectiveness and Prozac in ease of discontinuation.\n- People on SSRIs for anxiety tend to benefit more than those on them for depression. \n- Common side effects of SSRIs include sexual difficulties, emotional blunting, and fatigue.\n- Discontinuation syndrome is a common issue among people who stop taking SSRIs abruptly.\n \nKey Questions:\n- Do SSRIs work better for certain types of anxiety compared to others? \n- Why do SSRIs cause sexual difficulties, emotional blunting and cognitive difficulties?\n- Why are some SSRIs easier to discontinue than others? \n- What is the requirement for SSRIs to work effectively?"
