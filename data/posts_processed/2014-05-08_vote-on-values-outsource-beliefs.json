    "summary": "Key ideas \n- Social impact bonds save government money by having corporations invest in solving social problems with the promise of making a profit \n- The government agrees to pay corporations only if the social problem they helped to solve actually saves them money \n- Social impact bonds encourage success because corporations invest their own money to solve social problems \n- The corporate involvement mimics prediction markets, with the government outsourcing their beliefs about how to solve social problems \n- These bonds are a potential market solution to seemingly intractable social problems \n\nKey learnings \n- Free preventative care to the poor, free therapy for at-risk patients, and trade schools offering free classes to people on welfare could be created by outsourcing belief to corporations \n- Corporations with a profit incentive can solve social problems more efficiently than incompetent institutions \n- Incentivizing greed to promote social good has the potential to be successful \n\nKey questions \n- Should we be wary of bringing in organizations like Goldman Sachs to help solve social problems because of their role in the financial crash? \n- If other institutions are incompetent at solving social problems, should we turn to corporations and incentivize profit instead?"
