    "summary": "Key ideas\n- GPT-2, a text prediction program, has been tested to play chess after being trained on chess games written in standard notation\n- GPT-2 relies on pattern-matching and struggles when play deviates from its expectations \n- GPT-2's strengths include good at openings while weaknesses include bad at invalid moves \n- There are ways to make GPT-2 much better by rewriting games to provide (state,action) pairs \n\nKey learnings\n- GPT-2 is more than just an essay generator but a general pattern-recognition program with text-based input and output channels \n- GPT-2 can learn how to play chess after being trained on a corpus of chess games in standard notation \n\nKey questions\n- Is any of the skills GPT-2 learned, such as chess, music, and poetry, meaningful or just impressive as a result of its pattern-matching abilities? \n- What other tasks could GPT-2 potentially be trained to do with text-based input and output channels?"
