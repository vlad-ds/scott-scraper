    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Brain size relative to body is not the only factor in determining intelligence\n- The encephalization quotient (EQ) is a useful indicator but not perfect in predicting intelligence\n- Birds have high intelligence despite having small brains and a different brain structure than mammals\n- Number of cortical neurons may be one of the most important biological substrates of intelligence\n- Quick and efficient neural communication is also important\n- Pilot whales may be smarter than humans based on their cortical neuron count\n\nKey learnings:\n- Number of neurons in the brain may be a better predictor of intelligence than brain size relative to body\n- The neocortical structure may not be necessary for high intelligence, as is demonstrated in birds\n\nKey questions:\n- What is the physiological basis for intelligence?\n- Can we develop a generalized animal IQ test?\n- Are there other variations within species that impact intelligence other than number of neurons and neural communication?"
