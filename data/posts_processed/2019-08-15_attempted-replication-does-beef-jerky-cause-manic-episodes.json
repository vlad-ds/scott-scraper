    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- A study showed that beef jerky and other cured meats could trigger mania in bipolar disorder\n- The study was replicated with the 2019 Slate Star Codex survey, but no significant difference was found in mania hospitalizations between jerky-eaters and non-eaters\n- The author acknowledges limitations to the data but encourages others to replicate or expand on the findings\n\nKey learnings:\n- Self-report about mania hospitalization is less reliable than catching manic patients in the hospital\n- A finer-grained measure of beef jerky consumption was used in the 2019 survey compared to the original study\n- Other effects such as higher self-rated childhood trauma in people hospitalized by mania were confirmed in the survey\n\nKey questions:\n- Will psychiatrists adjust their advice to patients with bipolar disorder in light of these findings?\n- What are the limitations to the data used in this study?\n- How can the findings be expanded or replicated with different populations?"
