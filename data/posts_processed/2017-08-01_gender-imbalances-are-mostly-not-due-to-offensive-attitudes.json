    "summary": "Key ideas\n- The assumption that women are not involved in libertarianism due to tolerating too many sexists needs to be challenged.\n- Trump voters and the Catholic Church have a more gender-balanced ratio than libertarianism despite having non-feminist ideologies.\n- Gender differences in personality and interests, particularly in the people-things dimension, have a large impact on why more men are interested in libertarianism.\n\nKey learnings\n- Gender balance cannot be equated with good opinions and gender imbalance with sexism.\n- If gender balance cannot be achieved by eliminating sexism, it may be due to gender differences in personality and interest.\n- Casual sexist speech must be fought, but permanent states of emergency that require extreme measures to crack down on alleged sexism and jerky behavior are not helpful and can even backfire.\n\nKey questions\n- What other factors can affect gender differences in political attitudes aside from personality interests?\n- What measures can be done instead of extreme crackdowns to reduce the gender gap in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields?\n- Can an intersectional approach be applied to examine gender imbalance in STEM disproportionately affecting women belonging to minority groups?"
