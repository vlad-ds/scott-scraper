    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Confucianism gains popularity again in China as a principled alternative to Western philosophy.\n- Recent scientific and health discoveries related to gene drives, weighted blankets, Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, gun violence, and incentives for teachers.\n- Libertarians begin to move to New Hampshire to build a libertarian community.\n- Random facts on art, animals, the brain, and culture.\n\nKey learnings\n- Classical conditioning could potentially replace normal immunosuppressant drugs.\n- Mendelian randomization methodology could be used to test correlational drug side effects in pregnant women.\n- Free trade with China might have cost jobs without necessarily replacing them elsewhere.\n- The grit theory of success only accounts for 0.5% of variation in academic achievement, while intelligence accounts for 40%.\n\nKey questions\n- Can we really eliminate malaria by killing all mosquitos in the world?\n- What is the future of ancestry-adjusted economic success, and can we control our country's future ancestors?\n- How does culture affect family sizes, and can bilingualism have adversarial collaboration?\n- What is next for cryonics, and is the Brain Preservation Foundation's latest achievement a positive step forward?"
