    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- 170 people predicted the percentage of Americans agreeing with vague political statements\n- People were terrible at predicting the percentages, with an average error of 15% per issue\n- The predictions were overestimating the degree society has shifted to the left, by a tiny amount of one percentage point per issue\n- Athrelon and JRM were the most accurate in predicting the answers\n\nKey learnings:\n- Polling is not always accurate\n- People tend to overestimate the degree to which society has shifted to the left\n\nKey questions:\n- How can polling methods be improved?\n- What are the potential consequences of overestimating the degree of society's leftward shift?\n- Can predictions made by individuals be used to inform policy decisions?"
