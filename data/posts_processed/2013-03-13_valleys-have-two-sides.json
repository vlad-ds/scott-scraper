    "summary": "Key ideas\n- The concept of uncanny valleys exist where getting halfway towards a noble aim is worse than not having any noble aim at all. \n- Uncanny valleys of dictatorship work completely differently; even if 51% of the population supports it, it'll still be an unstable dictatorship.\n- Total control over a country is needed to defy the zeitgeist (the social norm on how to gain and keep power).\n\nKey learnings\n- Perfect unimpeded progress up the right side of the valley is better than attempted progress up the left side dragged down by lingering rightists.\n- The opposite of attempted progress up the left side dragged down by lingering rightists is attempted progress up the right side dragged down by lingering leftists.\n- Societies left to their own devices become more Progressive.\n\nKey questions\n- How are we going to get a perfectly secure despot with no fear whatsoever of rebellion when less than 1% of the population is in favor of such a despot?\n- Might it be kind of embarrassing when Scott Aaronson builds a quantum computer that can factor prime numbers in polynomial time and then becomes the new god-emperor?\n- Will Reaction be in the same position as the Communists, having to expend energy pumping against entropy to prevent societies from becoming more Progressive?"
