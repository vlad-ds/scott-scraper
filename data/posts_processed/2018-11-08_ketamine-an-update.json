    "summary": "Key ideas\n- Recent study finds naltrexone prevents ketamine's antidepressant effects, suggesting it works on the opiate system.\n- Buprenorphine, an opiate painkiller, can relieve the distress of acutely suicidal patients and also has rapid-acting antidepressant effects.\n- Ketamine's mode of action is more complicated than just the opiate system as it induces hallucinations and dissociation.\n- The psychiatric establishment's response is that ketamine should not be abandoned but ketamine clinics under anaesthesiologists should be discouraged in favor of care monitored by psychiatrists.\n\nKey learnings\n- Depression might have some sort of a connection with opiates.\n- Medicine has a habit of seizing on hopes that a less addictive version of an addictive thing is found, only to admit error once half the country is addicted to it.\n\nKey questions\n- Should we start thinking opiates have some deep connection to depression?\n- Does ketamine cross-sensitize people to other opiates? \n- Does it increase some sort of domain-general addiction-having-center in the brain?"
