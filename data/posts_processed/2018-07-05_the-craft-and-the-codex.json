    "summary": "Key ideas:\n\n- The rationalist community was initially focused on developing rationality as a martial art or craft.\n- There's a feeling that the community has made the least progress in improving the art of rationality itself.\n- The art of rationality involves more practice than theory.\n- Writing blog posts on hard or controversial topics can be viewed as the drudgery of rationality training and can be good practice for honing reflexes or generating heuristics.\n- Through discussing hard or controversial topics and resolving confusions, important questions about the heuristics or generators of heuristics which are reliable in which situations can be made.\n\nKey learnings:\n\n- The value of discussing hard or controversial topics for rationality training.\n- The importance of absorbing relevant results and refining intuitions about situations when science is trustworthy, or when heuristics are reliable in which situations.\n- The importance of rationality practice, both as individual and community practice.\n\nKey questions:\n\n- What role does this blog play in the rationalist project?\n- What heuristics or generators of heuristics are reliable in which situations?\n- What are the best ways to refine intuitions about the situations when science is trustworthy or unreliable?"
