    "summary": "Key ideas:\n- Statements can be \"ambijective\" - both subjective and objective at the same time.\n- Human variation can account for some differences in subjective taste, but not in more objective categorizations like planets or basic human needs.\n- Breaking down subjective evaluations into sets of objective questions is one way to better understand how and why people may differ on their evaluations.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Subjective evaluations can have varying degrees of objectiveness that may need to be teased out in debates.\n- The criteria for evaluating subjective preferences can themselves be underspecified and require further disambiguation.\n- Understanding the objective criteria that underlie subjective preferences can help resolve disputes and provide a more accurate picture of individual differences.\n\nKey questions: \n- What makes a statement \"ambijective\" and how can that label be useful in debates?\n- What is the relationship between human variation and different degrees of subjectivity/objectivity in evaluations?\n- Can breaking down subjective evaluations into sets of objective questions help us better understand individual preferences and resolve disputes?"
